PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Ellijay, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1979 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1979 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
This 2011 republication includes all amendatory legislation through Ord. No. 041811, adopted April 18, 2011, and was accomplished under the supervision of Beth Tattershall, Code Editor. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Ron McLaughlin, Senior Code Attorney, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Al Hoyle, Mayor; Sandra Sales, City Clerk; and David Lindsey, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement.

Amendments to this act are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act.

                  (b)  Any project shall be deemed "self-liquidating" if, in the judgment of the authority, the revenues and earnings to be derived by the authority therefrom and all facilities used in connection therewith will be sufficient to pay the costs of operating, maintaining, repairing, improving, and extending the project and to pay the principal of and interest on the revenue bonds which may be issued to finance, in whole or in part, the cost of such project or projects. 
                  Section 4. - Powers.

                  Section 5. - Revenue bonds. 
                  The authority, or any authority or body which has or which may in the future succeed to the powers, duties, and liabilities vested in the authority created by this act is authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of negotiable revenue bonds of the authority for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost as herein defined of any one or more projects. The principal of and interest on such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund provided in this act for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates per annum, payable at such time or times, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their date or dates, shall be payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the authority, and may be redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority in the resolution for the issuance of bonds. 
                  Section 6. - Same; form, denomination; registration; place of payment. 
                  The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereon, which may be at any bank or trust company inside or outside the state. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest. 
                  Section 7. - Same; signatures; seal. 
                  In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if such officer had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the authority and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the secretary of the authority and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of the chairman and the secretary of the authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signatures of such persons and any bond may be signed, sealed, and attested on behalf of the authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bonds such person may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. 
                  Section 8. - Same; negotiability; exemption from taxation. 
                  All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall have and are declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the laws of this state. Such bonds, their transfer, and the income therefrom shall be exempt from all taxation within the state. 
                  Section 9. - Same; sale; price; proceeds. 
                  The authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the authority. The proceeds derived from the sale of such bonds shall be used solely for the purpose or purposes provided in the resolutions and proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds. 
                  Section 10. - Same; interim receipts and certificates or temporary bonds. 
                  Prior to the preparation of any definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates, or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. 
                  Section 11. - Same; replacement of lost or mutilated bonds. 
                  The authority may provide for the replacement of any bonds or coupons which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. 
                  Section 12. - Same; conditions precedent to issuance. 
                  Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions, and things which are specified or required by this act. In the discretion of the authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular project. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special meeting of the authority by a majority of its members. 
                  Section 13. - Credit not pledged. 
                  Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the City of Ellijay, the City of East Ellijay, or Gilmer County nor a pledge of the faith and credit of said cities or county; but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate said cities or county to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment. All such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. 
                  Section 14. - Trust indenture as security. 
                  In the discretion of the authority, any issuance of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company inside or outside the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for the protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insuring of the project, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
                  Section 15. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
                  In the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, the authority shall provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank, or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. 
                  Section 16. - Sinking fund. 
                  The revenues, fees, tolls, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust instrument may provide. Such funds so pledged from whatever source received, including funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture into a sinking fund which shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of: 
                  (1)  The interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due; 
                  (2)  The principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due; 
                  (3)  The necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest and other investment charges; and 
                  (4)  Any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. 
                  The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust indenture, any surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds, and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and shall not again be issued. 
                  Section 17. - Remedies of bondholders. 
                  Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights given in this act may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted under this act or under such resolution or trust indenture and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished. 
                  Section 18. - Refunding bonds. 
                  The authority is authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of bonds of the authority for the purpose of funding or refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and premium, if any. The issuance of such funding or refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority in respect to the same shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this act insofar as the same may be applicable. 
                  Section 19. - Validation. 
                  Bonds of the authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 83, art. 3 (O.C.G.A. § 36-82-60 et seq.), known as the "Revenue Bond Law." The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action the State of Georgia or any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated and the state or such municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any exists, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the contract or contracts adjudicated as a part of the basis for the security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds when validated and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon and against the authority issuing the same and the state and any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality, if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the said Ellijay-Gilmer County Water and Sewerage Authority. 
                  Section 20. - Venue and jurisdiction. 
                  Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any suit or action against such authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Gilmer County, Georgia; and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions. 
                  Section 21. - Interest of bondholders protected. 
                  While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of said authority or its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds. No other entity, department, agency, or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds, and, upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds. 
                  Section 22. - Moneys received considered trust funds. 
                  All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenue, income, fees, and earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this act. 
                  Section 23. - Purpose of the authority. 
                  Without limiting the generality of any provision of this act, the general purpose of the authority is declared to be that of acquiring an adequate source or sources of water supply, treatment of such water, and thereafter the distribution of the same to the various municipalities and citizens in Gilmer County and environs, including adjoining counties and municipalities located therein, and further for the general purpose of gathering and treatment of waste, both individual and industrial; but such general purpose shall not restrict the authority from selling and delivering water directly to consumers in those areas where there does not now exist water distribution systems or furnishing sewer facilities to such customers and areas where neither any county nor municipality deems it desirable or feasible to furnish water in such locality.

                  (1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions. 
                  (2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles. 
                  (3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers. 
                  (4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ___ to ___" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code that embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code). 
                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

In the case of a roll-call vote, the name of each councilmember voting for or against a proposal shall be recorded. It shall be presumed that a councilmember has voted in the affirmative unless the minutes show otherwise. More detailed information may be included in the minutes at the request of the council. 
                  (b)  The council must approve the minutes before they can be considered as an official record of the council. A copy of the minutes from the previous meeting shall be distributed to the councilmembers at least one business day before the following meeting. The minutes of the previous meeting shall be corrected and approved by the council at the beginning of each meeting. A majority vote is required for approval. Conflicts about the content of the minutes shall be decided by majority vote. Upon being approved, the minutes shall be signed by the chairman and attested to by the city clerk.

                  Sec. 2-48. - Decorum. 
                  (a)  All councilmembers must conduct themselves in a professional and respectful manner. All remarks should be directed to the chairman and not to individual councilmembers, staff or citizens in attendance. Personal remarks are inappropriate. A councilmember is not allowed to speak at a meeting until he has been recognized by the chairman. All comments made by a councilmember shall address the motion that is being discussed. 
                  (b)  The chairman shall enforce these rules of decorum. If a councilmember believes that a rule has been broken, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chairman can rule on the question or he may allow the council to debate the issue and decide the issue by majority vote. 
                  (Code 1979, § 3-204(7)) 
                  Sec. 2-49. - Public participation. 
                  Public participation in meetings of the city council shall be permitted in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
                  (1)  Public comments. The final agenda item of the meeting shall be reserved for comments from the public. All members of the public who wish to address the council must submit their name and the topic of their comments to the city clerk at least three business days before the council meeting. These individuals will be allotted five minutes to make their comments, and their comments must be limited to their chosen topic. These limits can be waived by a majority vote of the council. 
                  (2)  Public participation on agenda items. By a majority vote, the council may allow public comment on an agenda item at the time the item is being considered by the council. These comments must be limited to the subject that is being debated. Members of the public may speak for five minutes and may only speak once. These limits may be waived by a majority vote of the council. Anyone wishing to speak at any council meeting must be recognized by the chairman before addressing the council. Total discussion per topic shall not exceed 20 minutes unless approved by the council. 
                  (3)  Decorum. Members of the public shall not make inappropriate or offensive comments at a council meeting and are expected to comply with the rules of decorum that are established for councilmembers. Individuals who violate any rules of the council may be ruled out of order by the chairman or on a point of order made by a councilmember. A majority vote of the council will rule on the point of order. An individual who violates the rules of decorum may be removed from the meeting at the direction of the chairman. 
                  (4)  Public hearings. The council may schedule public hearings for the purpose of soliciting public comment on any subject of interest to the council. Hearings may be held immediately prior to or following a meeting of the council or at such other places and times as the council may determine. No official action shall be taken at any such public hearing. 
                  Sec. 2-50. - Amendments to rules. 
                  Any amendments to the rules of order must be submitted by a councilmember in writing to the city manager three business days before a regular meeting of the council. The proposed amendment shall be included in the agenda for that meeting and distributed to all councilmembers. All amendments require a two-thirds vote of the council to be adopted. 
                  Sec. 2-51. - Suspending the rules of order. 
                  Rules of order may be suspended in the case of an emergency. A motion to suspend the rules requires a second, is debatable, and requires a two-thirds vote of the council. Rules governing quorum, voting methods and requirements, the notification to councilmembers of meetings, and rules necessary for compliance with state law cannot be suspended. 
                  Sec. 2-52. - Visual and sound recordings. 
                  Visual, sound, and visual and sound recordings shall be permitted for all public meetings. 
                  Sec. 2-53. - Compensation. 
                  Councilmembers shall receive $125.00 per month and $125.00 per meeting of the city council in compensation for their service. This pay rate shall be applied retroactively to begin in January 2008.

                  DIVISION 2. - PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE 

                  Sec. 2-71. - Rules of procedure. 
                  Unless otherwise provided in this Code, procedures for meetings of the city council shall follow an edition of Robert's Rules of Order prescribed by the mayor. 
                  Sec. 2-72. - Parliamentarian. 
                  The city attorney shall serve as the parliamentarian for council meetings. 
                  Sec. 2-73. - Main motion. 
                  In order for the council to take any official action on any subject, a councilmember must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the chairman until another councilmember agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the councilmember seconding the motion to support the motion. A councilmember may withdraw a main motion that he has made at any time before the council has voted on that motion. 
                  Sec. 2-74. - Debate. 
                  (a)  After the main motion is recognized by the chair, the council shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the chairman in a manner that is fair to all members of the council. Councilmembers may participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the chairman. 
                  (b)  During the course of debate, councilmembers may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the council take a particular action on a motion. There are two classes of subsidiary motions: debatable subsidiary motions and undebatable subsidiary motions. Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee, and postpone to a time certain. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: limit debate, vote immediately, and lay on the table. They require a second and cannot be debated. 
                  (c)  Councilmembers may also introduce privileged motions. Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on privileged motions. 
                  Sec. 2-75. - Voting; procedure. 
                  Voting on debatable motions and voting on undebatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways: 
                  a.  If debate has been completed and no other councilmember wishes to speak, the chairman can call for the vote; if there are no objections, the chairman can proceed with their vote; 
                  b.  If the chairman calls for the vote and there is an objection, a member of the council may move to vote immediately ("move the previous question"). If this motion is seconded and approved by a two-thirds vote, debate will stop. The chairman will then read the proposed motion to the council and ask for the votes of the councilmembers. 
                  (2)  Undebatable motions. In the case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the chair. The chairman shall read the proposed motion to the council and then call for the vote. 
                  Sec. 2-76. - Ranking of motions. 
                  (a)  Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the council returns to consider the motion of lower precedence. 
                  (b)  A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and will take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section. Motions at the bottom of the following list take precedence over motions at the top of the list: 
                  (1)  Main motion (lowest rank). 
                  (2)  Subsidiary motions (debatable): 
                  a.  Postpone indefinitely. 
                  b.  Amend. 
                  c.  Refer to committee (commit). 
                  d.  Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). 
                  (3)  Subsidiary motions (undebatable): 
                  a.  Limit debate or extend limits. 
                  b.  Vote immediately (previous question). 
                  c.  Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). 
                  (4)  Privileged motions (undebatable): 
                  a.  Question of privilege. 
                  b.  Recess. 
                  c.  Adjourn (highest rank). 
                  Sec. 2-77. - Subsidiary motions. 
                  During the course of debate, councilmembers may introduce motions that propose that the council take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions and they allow the council to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions—amend, limit debate and vote immediately—also may apply to other subsidiary motions. 
                  (1)  Postpone indefinitely. If a councilmember believes that the main motion should not be considered by the council, that councilmember may move to postpone the consideration of the main motions indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled. A motion to postpone indefinitely may be debated, but it cannot be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (2)  Amend. If a councilmember believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion. 
                  a.  Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend. 
                  b.  Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a time certain and the motion to recess can also be amended. 
                  c.  A motion cannot be amended more than two times. 
                  d.  Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable. 
                  e.  A majority vote is required for the council to adopt an amendment. 
                  f.  If the amendment is adopted, the council shall consider the amended version of the motion. 
                  (3)  Refer to a committee (commit). If a councilmember believes that further information is needed before the council can act on a main motion, he may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, then a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to refer should specify the date that the committee or department will report back to the council. This motion is debatable and amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (4)  Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a councilmember believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. It is debatable and can be amended. If this motion is passed, the chairman will bring the original motion back to the council for consideration at the specified time. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (5)  Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the councilmember who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion, and a two-thirds vote is required. 
                  (6)  Vote immediately (previous question). If a councilmember believes that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the councilmember may move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable, and a vote of two-thirds of the council is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (7)  Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the meeting. The motion can be brought up for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the council during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion, and the motion is not amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  Sec. 2-78. - Privileged motions. 
                  Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting. They do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on these motions. 
                  (1)  Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the chairman concerning the rights of a councilmember or of the council as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The chairman is required to make a ruling on the question. 
                  (2)  Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on this motion, but the motion can be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (3)  Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a councilmember must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion, and as a result it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second but is not debatable or amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  Sec. 2-79. - Incidental motions. 
                  Incidental motions allow councilmembers to exert their rights as a member of the council. Incidental motions can be introduced at any time during a meeting. 
                  (1)  Appeal. If a councilmember disagrees with a decision that is made by the chair, that councilmember may appeal the decision. If the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the council. The chairman has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The council may then debate the appeal. The council shall decide by majority vote if the chair's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is high in precedence and can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (2)  Parliamentary inquiry. If a councilmember has a question about the rules of order, he may ask the chairman to give an opinion on that question. This question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the council. This motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. This motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (3)  Point of order (question of order). If a councilmember believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chairman can make a ruling on the question or can allow the council to debate and then rule on the question by majority vote. A point of order can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (4)  Point of information (request for information). If a councilmember has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, he may ask a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the chairman and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required and the motion is not debatable or amendable. 
                  Sec. 2-80. - Supplementary main motions. 
                  Three motions allow the council to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the council. These motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the ways specified: 
                  (1)  Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the council to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress. It allows the council to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any councilmember may make a motion to reconsider, and any councilmember may second the motion. The motion is debatable, but it cannot be amended. A majority vote of the council is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided and the council will return to debate and revote the original motion. 
                  (2)  Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the council overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any councilmember. It is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the councilmember seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting pursuant to section 2-44. The motion to rescind will then be placed on the agenda for the next meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will formally be made. If it is seconded, the council shall debate and vote on rescission. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided. 
                  (3)  Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the council to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. This motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. It is a main motion but ranks higher than any debatable motion. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.

                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (c)(16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12 (the Metropolitan River Protection Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq.), a part of the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act" (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.), shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12 (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act" (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.), except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 092804, § 1(exh. A, § IV), 9-28-2004; Ord. No. 031510, § IV, 3-15-2010) 
                  Sec. 38-235. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance in Appendix A to this Code, stormwater management regulations in this Code, subdivision ordinance in Appendix B to this Code, flood damage prevention regulations in chapter 42, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the city to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the code enforcement officer and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 38-234(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by two copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 38-234(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 38-234(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his level of involvement with the process, as developed by the Commission and in consultation with the division and the Stakeholder Advisory Board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for the site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Plan Review Checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 38-234(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Ord. No. 092804, § 1(exh. A, § V), 9-28-2004; Ord. No. 031510, § V, 3-15-2010) 
                  Sec. 38-236. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The code enforcement officer will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The code enforcement officer shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority. 
                  (Ord. No. 092804, § 1(exh. A, § VI), 9-28-2004; Ord. No. 031510, § VI, 3-15-2010) 
                  Sec. 38-237. - Penalties and incentives. 
                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order; and 
                  (3)  All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 38-235(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city Charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 42-31. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and city council of the City of Ellijay, Georgia, does ordain as follows. 
                  ( Ord. No. 031912, art. 1, § A, 3-19-2012 ) 
                  Sec. 42-32. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Ellijay, Georgia, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  ( Ord. No. 031912, art. 1, § B, 3-19-2012 ) 
                  Sec. 42-33. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  Elevated building means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event. 
                  Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before August 15, 1990. 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before August 18, 1980. 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or

                  Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, where the boundaries of areas of special flood hazard have been defined as Zone A. 
                  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, delineating the areas of special flood hazard and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
                  Flood insurance study means the official report by the Federal Insurance Administration evaluating flood hazards and containing flood profiles and water surface elevations of the base flood. 
                  Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
                  Flood-proofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is: 
                  (1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register:

                  b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after August 15, 1990 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after August 18, 1980 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after August 18, 1980. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood modernization maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis;

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: Accessory structures are not exempt from any article requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision is the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Application for a development permit shall be made to the code enforcement officer on forms furnished by the City of Ellijay prior to any development activities, and may include, but not be limited to the following: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the elevations of the area in question and the nature, location, dimensions, of existing or proposed structures, earthen fill placement, storage of materials or equipment, and drainage facilities. 
                  Specifically, the following information is required: 
                  (1)  Application stage. 
                  a.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level (or highest adjacent grade) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all proposed structures; 
                  b.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-residential structure will be flood-proofed; 
                  c.  Design certification from a registered professional engineer or architect that any proposed non-residential flood-proofed structure will meet the flood-proofing criteria of subsection (2); and 
                  d.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of a proposed development. 
                  (2)  Construction stage. For all new construction and substantial improvements, the permit holder shall provide to the administrator an as-built certification of the regulatory floor elevation or flood-proofing level immediately after the lowest floor or flood-proofing is completed. Any lowest floor certification made relative to mean sea level shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. When flood-proofing is utilized for non-residential structures, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. 
                  Any work undertaken prior to submission of these certifications shall be at the permit holder's risk. 
                  The code enforcement officer shall review the above referenced certification data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being allowed to proceed. Failure to submit certification or failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.

                  DIVISION 3. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 42-71. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  (i)  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  (ii)  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  (iii)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area, and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding, and; 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
                  ( Ord. No. 031912, art. 5, § A, 3-19-2012 ) 
                  Sec. 42-72. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 42-71(4), "Elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 42-58(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
                  (i)  Individual lots or parcels, 
                  (ii)  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, 
                  (iii)  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or 
                  (iv)  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  (i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  (ii)  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection 42-71(6) above.) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  (i)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, 
                  (ii)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  (iii)  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)a. and c., above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-36, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)(a) above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 3.

                  Sec. 42-73. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-Zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-36, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 24-36, then the code enforcement officer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 3. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-Zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed.) Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 42-71(4), "Elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.

                  Sec. 42-91. - [Variance procedures.] 
                  (a)  The board of appeals, as established by the City of Ellijay, shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the code enforcement officer in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of appeals may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Gilmer County as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this division are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and, 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The code enforcement officer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

No grading or building permit shall be issued without a certificate of appropriateness. 
                  (1)  The department of transportation [or] any contractors, including the City of Ellijay, performing work funded by the department of transportation are exempt from this ordinance. 
                  (2)  Local governments are also exempt from the requirement of obtaining certificates of appropriateness, provided that local governments notify the commission 45 days prior to beginning an undertaking that would otherwise [require] a certificate of appropriateness, and allow the commission an opportunity to comment.

Notice of the hearing shall be published in the principal newspaper of local circulation in the county, and written notice of the hearing shall be mailed by the commission to all owners of any properties likely to be materially affected by the application, and published notice shall be provided in the same manner and time frame as notices are provided before a public hearing for rezoning.

                  (1)  The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change(s) in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the historical, archaeological, architectural or aesthetic significance and value of the historic property, site, or district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the following criteria for each of the following acts: 
                  a.  Reconstruction, alteration, new construction or renovation: The commission shall issue certificates of appropriateness for the above proposed actions, if those actions conform in design, scale, building material, setback and landscaping to the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, incorporated herein by reference, and the commission's adopted guidelines. 
                  b.  Relocation: A decision by the commission approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the relocation of a building, structure, or object shall be guided by: 
                  1.  The historic character and aesthetic interest the building, structure or object contributes to its present setting. 
                  2.  Whether there are definite plans for the area to be vacated and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area will be. 
                  3.  Whether the building, structure or object can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity. 
                  4.  Whether the proposed relocation area is compatible with the historical and architectural character of the building, structure, site or object. 
                  c.  Demolition: A decision by the commission approving or denying a certificate of appropriateness for the demolition of buildings, structures, sites, or objects shall be guided by: 
                  1.  The historic, scenic or architectural significance of the building, structure, site, or object. 
                  2.  The importance of the building, structure, site, or object to the ambiance of a district. 
                  3.  The difficulty or the impossibility of reproducing such a building, structure, site, or object because of its design, texture, material, detail, or unique location. 
                  4.  Whether the building, structure, site, or object is one of the last remaining examples of its kind in the neighborhood, the city, or the county. 
                  5.  Whether there are definite plans for reuse of the property if the proposed demolition is carried out, and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area would be. 
                  6.  Whether reasonable measures can be taken to save the building, structure, site, or object from collapse. 
                  7.  Whether the building, structure, site, or object prevents the earning of reasonable economic return on the property on which it is located. 
                  (g)  Undue hardship. When, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of the ordinance from which this section derived would result in the exceptional practical difficulty or undue economic hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to said provisions, or to interpret the meaning of said provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided that such variances, modifications or interpretations remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of said provisions, so that the architectural, archaeological, or historical integrity, or character of the property be conserved, and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgement, best fulfill the purpose of the ordinance from which this section derived. An undue hardship shall not be a situation of the person's own making. 
                  (h)  Deadline for approval or rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. The commission shall approve or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within 45 days after the filing thereof by the owner or occupant of a historic property, or of a building, structure, site, or object located within a historic district. Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission. Notice of the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be sent by United States mail to the applicant and all other persons who have requested such notice in writing filed with the commission. 
                  Failure of the commission to act within said 45 days shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. 
                  (i)  Necessary action to be taken by commission upon rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. In the event the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so, and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he or she so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
                  In cases where the application involves a threat to archaeological resources or a material change in the appearance of an exterior architectural or environmental feature which would require the issuance of a grading or building permit, the commission shall notify the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing grading or building permits in writing, and the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing grading or building permits and, in such a case, no grading or building permit shall be issued. 
                  (j)  Requirement of conformance with certificate of appropriateness. All work performed pursuant to an issued certificate of appropriateness shall conform to the requirements of such certificate. In the event work is performed not in accordance with such certificate, or in violation of a denial of a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall issue a cease and desist order and all work shall cease. 
                  The mayor and city council or the commission shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any material change in appearance of a designated historic site, property, or historic district, except those changes made in compliance with the provisions of the ordinance from which this section derived or to prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such historic site, property, or historic district. 
                  (k)  Certificate of appropriateness void if construction not commenced. A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless construction is commenced within six months of date of issuance. Certificates of appropriateness shall be issued for a period of 18 months and are renewable. 
                  (l)  Recording of applications for certificate of appropriateness. The commission shall keep a public record of all applications for certificates of appropriateness, and of all the commission's proceedings in connection with said applications. 
                  (m)  Acquisition of property. The commission may, where such action is authorized by the mayor and city council, and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preservation of a unique historic property, enter into negotiations with the owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange, or otherwise, to the property or any interest therein. 
                  (n)  Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the mayor and council of the City of Ellijay. Any such appeal must be filed within 15 days after the issuance of the determination pursuant to subsection (h) or, in the case of a failure of the commission to act, within 15 days of the expiration of the 45-day period allowed for comission action, subsection (h). 
                  The mayor and city council may approve, modify, or reject the determination made by the commission, if the governing body finds that the commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision. Appeals from decision of the mayor and city council may be taken to the superior court of county in the manner provided by law for appeals from conviction for county ordinance violations.

                  (2)  In the event the commission determines a failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair, the commission will notify the owner of the property and set forth the steps which need to be taken to remedy the situation. The owner of such property will have 30 days in which to do this. 
                  (3)  In the event that the condition is not remedied in 30 days, the owner shall be punished as provided in section 48-10 and, at the direction of the mayor and city council, the commission may perform such maintenance or repair as is necessary to prevent deterioration or demolition by neglect. The owner of the property shall be liable for the cost of such maintenance and repair performed by the commission. 
                  (c)  Affirmation of existing building and zoning codes. Nothing in the ordinance from which this section derived shall be construed as to exempt property owners from complying with existing city building and zoning codes, nor to prevent any property owner from making any use of his property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances or regulations.

Any settlement of the surface within the two-year period shall be deemed conclusive evidence of defective backfilling by the permittee, except that nothing contained in this section shall be construed to require the permittee to maintain any repairs to pavement made by the city if such repairs should prove defective. Recovery on such bond for any injury or accident shall not exhaust the bond, but it shall in its entirety cover any or all future accidents or injuries during the excavation work for which it is given. In the event of any suit or claim against the city by reason of the negligence or default of the permittee, upon the city's giving written notice to the permittee of such suit or claim, any final judgment against the city requiring it to pay for such damage shall be conclusive upon the permittee and its surety.

                  (b)  The permittee shall route and control traffic, including its own vehicles, as directed by the city police department. The following steps shall be taken before any highway may be closed or restricted to traffic:

                  (4)  Where flagmen are deemed necessary by the chief of police, they shall be furnished by the permittee at his own expense. Through traffic shall be maintained without the aid of detours, if possible. In instances in which this would not be feasible, the street superintendent will designate detours. The city shall maintain roadway surfaces of existing highways designated as detours without expense to the permittee; but if there are no existing highways, the permittee shall construct all detours at his expense and in conformity with the specifications of the street superintendent. The permittee will be responsible for any unnecessary damage caused to any highways by the operation of his equipment.

If it becomes necessary to remove an existing utility, this shall be done by its owner. No utility owned by the city shall be moved to accommodate the permittee unless the cost of such work is borne by the permittee unless the permittee makes other arrangements with the person owning the utility. 
                  (b)  A permittee shall support and protect by timbers or otherwise all pipes, poles, wires or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by the excavation work, and do everything necessary to support, sustain and protect them under, over, along or across the work. In case any of such pipes, conduits, poles, wires or apparatus should be damaged, they shall be repaired by the agency or person owning them; and the expense of such repairs shall be charged to the permittee; and the bond of the permittee shall be liable for the expense. The permittee shall be responsible for any damage done to any public or private property by reason of the breaking of any water pipes, sewer, gas pipe, electric conduit, or other utility; and its bond shall be liable. The permittee shall inform itself as to the existence and location of all underground utilities and protect them against damage.

Where in the protection of such property it is necessary to enter upon private property for the purpose of taking appropriate protective measures, the permittee shall obtain permission from the owner of such private property for such purpose. The permittee shall, at its own expense, shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences or other property likely to be damaged during the progress of the excavation work and shall be responsible for all damage to public or private property or highways resulting from its failure properly to protect and carry out said work. Wherever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench through any lawn area, the sod shall be carefully cut and rolled and replaced after ditches have been backfilled. All construction and maintenance work shall be done in a manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and debris and in a condition as near as possible to that which existed before such work began. The permittee shall not remove even temporarily any trees or shrubs which exist in parking strip areas or easements across private property without first having notified and obtained the consent of the property owner, or in the case of public property, the street superintendent.

                  Access means entrance to or exit from land adjacent to a public road. 
                  Accessible frontage means that length of property adjoining a highway which is legally accessible horn the highway. Frontage along a limited access highway shall not be included as part of the nearest travel lane to the centerline of the driveway. An angle of 90 degrees is desirable. 
                  Angle of an entrance driveway means the angle of deflection measured horn the centerline of an "ENTER ONLY" driveway to the centerline of the nearest travel lane. This angle should never exceed 90 degrees. 
                  Angle of an exit driveway means the angle of deflection measured horn the centerline of an "EXIT ONLY" driveway to the centerline of the nearest travel lane. This angle should never exceed 90 degrees. 
                  Applicant means the person or organization who has applied for a permit. This should be the property owner or owners, official representative of the organization (company, partnership, etc.) which owns the property or is leasing it for at least three years. A copy of the deed or lease will be required as part of the application process. 
                  Commercial driveway means any private entrance, exit, ramp, tunnel, bridge, side road or other vehicular passageway to any property used for commercial purposes, except a farm or dwelling house not exceeding a four-family capacity, and leading to or horn any public road on the city highway system. 
                  Department means the city building inspection department. 
                  DOT means the state department of transportation. 
                  Driveway width means the narrowest width of a driveway measured perpendicular to the centerline of the driveway, from edge of pavement to edge of pavement.

                  Right-of-way line means a line which defines the limits of the R/W of a public road as it relates to adjacent property. 
                  Right-of-way miter means a R/W line at an intersection which is parallel to neither road but forms a triangle with extensions of the R/W lines of the adjacent sides of the intersecting roads. The purpose of the R/W miter is to provide improved visibility for vehicles approaching the intersection by enabling the city to eliminate visual obstructions or provide room for a traffic light support pole or guy wire. Driveway should never be allowed along the R/W miter. 
                  Roadway means the portion of a highway ordinarily used for vehicular travel, exclusive of the sidewalk, shoulder or median. 
                  Sight distance means the length of roadway ahead visible to the driver. The minimum sight distance available on a roadway should be sufficiently long to enable a vehicle traveling at or near the design speed to stop before reaching a stationary object in its path.

                  Sec. 66-162. - Closing or altering a driveway. 
                  In addition to the conditions agreed to by the applicant set forth below, the department may alter or close driveway or require the applicant to alter or close driveway to property abutting city roads for the following reasons: 
                  (1)  The driveway creates an unreasonable interference with the property use of a public road by the traveling public. 
                  (2)  It becomes necessary to use the R/W to widen and improve the existing roadway or to construct service roads or to make any other revisions in location, alignment or grade of the roadway, making the approved drive impractical, hazardous or otherwise objectionable. 
                  (Ord. No. 081803A, § 1, 8-18-2003) 
                  Sec. 66-163. - Prohibited encroachments. 
                  The following encroachments on city rights-of-way are prohibited: 
                  (1)  City R/W must not be used for parking or storage of any vehicle, except for temporary parking of disabled vehicles on the sides of roads. 
                  (2)  No materials can be stored or placed upon city R/W unless authorized by the department. 
                  (3)  Stormwater from property adjacent to the R/W may not be diverted into the highway drainage system. Commercial wastewater will not be allowed on city R/W. 
                  (4)  No wall, fences, signs, large rocks, monuments, structures, trees or other plant life can be placed on or removed from city R/W without a special encroachment permit.

                  DIVISION 2. - PERMIT 

                  Sec. 66-164. - Permit required. 
                  Any third party (which term, as defined in the regulations adopted herewith, includes any utility) desiring to physically modify any portion of a city road shall comply with each provision of this article by first filing with the office of the city building inspector an application in writing in such form as the city may prescribe, and obtain a formal permit for such modification. This permit process applies to all roads under jurisdiction of the city. 
                  (Ord. No. 081803A, § 1, 8-18-2003) 
                  Sec. 66-165. - Application and approval procedures. 
                  (a)  Application forms. Applications for the various permits must be made on the proper form. These forms may be obtained from the department. Only original forms may be used when making applications for one of these permits. Each copy of the application must be signed in ink by the applicant. Application forms will not be furnished for future needs; rather, they will be provided for each permit request after the geometric design and location of the requested driveway and/or other encroachments are agreed upon. 
                  (b)  Application qualifications. Application for a permit under these rules will be accepted only from the property owner, lessor or an official representing the company, organization or group which owns or leases the property abutting the R/W and upon which the driveway or other permit work will be constructed. In the event the applicant leases the property, the lease should be for a period of at least three years, or the permit must be issued to the property owner. In any case, written acknowledgment of the permit work must be obtained from the owner or his agent. 
                  (c)  Permit provisions. The provisions of any permit granted shall be construed as regulatory and not as contractual. No interest or right of an applicant shall be transferred to another except by written consent of the department. No inherent or related right or privilege belonging to any abutting property owner is affected, interfered with or abridged by these standards or by any permit issued there under, nor is the city responsible for any damage claim which may arise between the applicant and any adjacent property owner. 
                  (d)  Cost. The cost of permit will be as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges on file in the office of the city clerk. 
                  (e)  Permit conditions. The conditions enumerated in this subsection are agreed to by the applicant for a driveway or encroachment permit and are part of the terms of such permits. These conditions to the permit continue in effect unless changes are made or authorized by the department and are enumerated as follows: 
                  (1)  Driveways shall not be provided within the R/W for purposes of parking, loading, servicing, etc. 
                  (2)  An approved permit must be picked up by the applicant within 60 days of approval. If not, the permit must be canceled. 
                  (3)  Work under the permit must begin within 90 days after approval. Failure to begin work will be cause for the permit to be canceled. 
                  (4)  Construction work authorized by an approved permit should be completed within 12 months following approval of the permit. Permitted work not completed within 12 months, for just reasons, may be officially extended for additional six-month increments after review and approval by the city building inspector. 
                  (5)  Applicants to whom permits have been approved shall at all times indemnify and save harmless the department and city from responsibility for any damage or liability arising from the maintenance, repair, operation or use of any installation, construction procedures or actual construction approved under the permit. When determined necessary by the department, the applicant must exhibit satisfactory evidence of adequate liability insurance to cover all phases of work specified under the permit for the protection of the traveling public. Limits of such coverage shall be determined separately for each applicant and declared by the department at its discretion. 
                  (6)  No driveway approach or other improvement constructed on a city road as an exercise of the permit shall be relocated or its dimensions altered without the written permission of the department. 
                  (7)  No property interest is created by the granting of a permit even if the applicant, or his transferee or a subsequent transferee, has incurred expenses or expended effort in reliance on such permit.

                  DIVISION 3. - RESIDENTIAL DRIVEWAYS 

                  Sec. 66-166. - Specifications. 
                  (a)  The department will approve the applicant's request regarding location of the drive, the size pipe, if required, to be placed under the driveway, and approve the grading plan from the outer edge of the shoulder of the road to the R/W line. 
                  (b)  Access to public or private streets from residential property shall be limited to one access point unless special circumstances exist and special need for a second access point can be demonstrated to the department. The department will review the circumstances and approve as necessary. 
                  (c)  All driveways are to be constructed so that the first 18 feet of driveway (measured from the edge of the street being accessed and running into the residential property) is at a 90-degree angle or as close as physically possible to the street abutting the property. (Perpendicular to the street being accessed as described by angle of an entrance driveway under section 66-161, Definitions.) The first 18 feet of driveway must be not greater than 18 percent slope. 
                  (d)  Residential driveways are, as the name implies, driveways to private residences. Driveways are to a minimum of 14 feet wide and a maximum of 18 feet wide. Under special circumstances, such as occasional use by a large RV (recreational vehicle), where there is not enough room to safely negotiate a turn into or out of the drive without stopping and/or backing into the roadway, the driveway may be up to 24 feet wide. It is recommended that turnarounds be provided to avoid vehicles backing onto the highway. 
                  (e)  Newly constructed driveways shall be an improved surface to include concrete, asphalt, brick or brick and/or concrete pavers. There should be at least a two-foot shoulder along and around the radii before beginning the slope down to the drainage ditch. The front slope, back slope and the slope around the end of the drain pipe under the drive, if present, should be the same as if it were a commercial driveway and as required by the department's approved grading plan. 
                  (f)  Residential driveways are required to have proper drainage on both sides (unless the finished grade topography does not require a drainage feature and there is no drainage feature along the abutting street that will be obstructed by the proposed driveway.) to prevent spillage onto said R/W. Where there is a drainage feature such as a ditch or drain pipe running along or parallel to the public or private street, drainage should be unobstructed and should include a drain pipe under the proposed driveway. The size and material of the pipe will be approved by the department. The pipe shall be placed a minimum of two feet below the driveway base and placed so as to match the existing drainage feature's elevation. The pipe should extend beyond the driveway width on either side at least 12 inches and shall include at the discharge end rip-rap rock around the exposed pipe and for a length of eight times the diameter of the pipe.

                  DIVISION 4. - COMMERCIAL DRIVEWAYS 

                  Sec. 66-167. - Purpose. 
                  The specifications presented herein are intended to provide basic information for permit approval. When presented with this information, the department can review the application in a timely manner and fulfill its responsibility to preserve the functional integrity of the city road system and to promote the safe and efficient movement of people and goods throughout the city and to treat all applications fairly and equitably. 
                  (Ord. No. 081803A, § 1, 8-18-2003) 
                  Sec. 66-168. - Driveway encroachment. 
                  (a)  Right-of-way miter. No part of any driveway should be permitted to encroach upon the R/W miter. The R/W miter is that additional R/W which has been secured for the highway behind the prolongation of the normal R/W lines in order to provide for channelization of traffic or more adequate sight distance. 
                  (b)  Intersection features. 
                  (1)  The legs, connections, ramps, and other roadway features of a highway intersection or interchange are a part of the intersection or interchange. The safety of the public and the planned movement of traffic require that no driveway be connected with such features for the purpose of serving a commercial business. 
                  (2)  A driveway serving a roadside area should not be connected to a service or frontage road of a limited access road in the area where said service road serves the dual purpose of a leg, connector or ramp of an intersection or interchange. 
                  (3)  No driveway should be connected to a frontage road or service road in the area where the service road is widened or curved for the connection with an interchange or intersection connection, ramp or leg. 
                  (4)  No portion of a driveway, other than a normal radius, should enter the R/W at a point which is less than 25 feet from the point of intersection of the R/W lines. Where limited access R/W exist and the frontage is limited in a manner which would deny all access to the property, this distance may be reduced to ten feet. 
                  (Ord. No. 081803A, § 1, 8-18-2003) 
                  Sec. 66-169. - Sight distance. 
                  A driveway should never be located on a short-crest vertical curve, just beyond a short crest vertical curve or on a sharp horizontal curve. All driveways should be located, designed and constriction so that motorists will have adequate sight distance in both directions along the highway. A permit will not be issued for a driveway when adequate sight distance is not available. If good cause can be sworn, and a suitable restriction placed on the driveway, the department may waive this requirement. Sight distance as used for driveways should be measured from a point 15 feet from the edge of the travel way at a height of 3½ feet above the surface of the roadway to an object on the centerline of the road two feet above the surface of the roadway and 30 feet in either direction from the proposed driveway. 
                  (Ord. No. 081803A, § 1, 8-18-2003) 
                  DIVISION 5. - OTHER DRIVEWAYS 

                  Sec. 66-170. - Utility driveways. 
                  Access to utility sites such as power substations, water tanks, or telephone service sites are to be permitted and should be treated much the same as a residential drive for design and sight distance.

                  (a)  No taxicab shall be permitted to be used or operated in this city until such vehicle has been thoroughly and carefully inspected and examined under the supervision of the chief of police and has been found to comply with such reasonable rules and regulations respecting safety and sanitation as may be prescribed by the chief of police.

No driver shall solicit passengers for a taxicab except when sitting in the driver's compartment of such taxicab or while standing immediately adjacent to the curb side. The driver of any taxicab shall remain in the driver's compartment or immediately adjacent to his vehicle at all times when such vehicle is upon the public street; except that, when necessary, a driver may be absent from his taxicab for not more than ten consecutive minutes; and nothing contained in this section shall be held to prohibit any driver from alighting to the street or sidewalk for the purpose of assisting passengers into or out of such vehicle.

                  (c)  Receipt and discharge of passengers on sidewalk only.

                  (d)  Cruising. No driver shall cruise in search of passengers except in such areas and at such times as shall be designated by the chief of police. Such areas and times shall only be designated when the officer finds that taxicab cruising would not congest traffic or be dangerous to pedestrians and other vehicles. 
                  (e)  Solicitation of other common carrier passengers prohibited. No driver, owner or operator shall solicit passengers at the terminal of any other common carrier, nor at any intermediate points along any established route of any other common carrier. 
                  (f)  Additional passengers. No driver shall permit any other person to occupy or ride in the taxicab, unless the person first employing the taxicab shall consent to the acceptance of additional passenger. No charge shall be made for an additional passenger except when the additional passenger rides beyond the previous passenger's destination and then only for the additional distance so traveled.

                  A land disturbing permit will only be issued in conjunction with an approved building permit application unless the building inspector determines that the work to be performed after land disturbing is done will not require a building permit. 
                  When clearing and grading a site for new construction or additions to existing buildings, footings or foundation walls must be excavated and ready for inspection within 30 days after final clearing and rough grade is achieved. The building inspector will monitor the project site to determine the point of progress at which the site is ready for foundation work to begin. After inspection, the inspector will notify the owner that the site is ready for foundation work. Upon notification by the inspector, owner shall have 30 days to commence building. It shall be a violation of the terms of the building permit and this ordinance if the owner fails to begin building within the 30-day period.

The owner will be assessed a penalty starting the fifth day of interruption of work, and each day that the interruption continues will constitute a new penalty. If there is an interruption in work for a period lasting 30 days after the fourth day of interruption for any reason other than the exceptions listed herein, the building permit will then be voided. The owner must then seed and mulch any bare or exposed earth immediately, remove any construction related equipment from the site and reapply for a new land disturbing permit and building permit. 
                  The exceptions to this section are as follows: 
                  1.  A period of inclement weather which renders the site unsuitable for excavation, concrete pouring and finishing, or any outdoor construction related work affected by weather involving rain, sleet, snow or sub-freezing temperatures.

                  2.  Any extreme financial hardship including but not limited to the owner's filing bankruptcy or the owner's funding source filing bankruptcy. Proof must be provided to the building inspections office to prevent penalties from accruing and voiding of permits. Upon the building inspector's due consideration of the cause of hardship, a decision to suspend penalties and possibly grant a 30-day extension of time will be made at the discretion of the building inspector.

                  4.5-5.  State department of transportation approval.

                  ARTICLE 7. - BUFFER REQUIREMENTS 
                  Requirement. A buffer shall be required whenever two adjoining properties are in dissimilar zone districts as shown in the following table 7.1: 
                  TABLE 7.1.  BUFFER REQUIREMENTS BETWEEN DISSIMILAR ZONE DISTRICTS 

                   

                  Sec. 7.1. - Determination of buffer requirements. 
                  In all situations, when two adjoining properties are in dissimilar zone districts as indicated in table 7.1, the property within the zone district allowing more intensive uses is required to provide the buffer when acquiring a building permit unless the buffer was preexisting. When two adjoining vacant parcels are in dissimilar zone districts as indicated in table 7.1, no buffer is required when the parcel zoned for the less intensive use acquires a building permit. 
                  Sec. 7.2. - Buffer design. 
                  All buffers required by this article shall conform to the following specifications: 
                  7.2-1.  Prior to development, a buffer plan shall be required to show the types and locations of all screening devices within a required buffer. If a site plan is required, a buffer plan shall be incorporated as part of the site development plan. 
                  7.2-2.  Landscaping within buffer areas shall be used to screen objectionable views or nuisances, such as parking and service areas, refuse containers, air conditioning units and transformers. 
                  7.2-3.  Existing on-site trees and shrub plants may be credited as meeting the requirements of this article if the zoning administrator determines that such plant materials achieve the purposes of this article. 
                  7.2-4.  Buffer "A" Design. Buffer "A" as required in table 7.1 shall consist of plantings or a fence, wall (not otherwise part of a structure or accessory structure), or a berm, which meets the screening standards of section 7.2-7. 
                  7.2-5.  [Base Width of Plantings.] If plantings are chosen method of screening, the planting area shall have a minimum base width of 12 feet. 
                  7.2-6.  Buffer "B" Design. Buffer "B" as required in table 7.1 shall have not less than a 20-foot base width and shall consist of plantings plus a fence, wall (not otherwise part of a structure or accessory structure), or a berm, or any combination thereof, which meets the screening standards of section 7.2-7. 
                  7.2-7.  Screening Standards. Screening is a method of visually shielding or obscuring one use from another by fence, walls, berms or densely planted vegetation. 
                  Plantings. Plantings shall consist of either trees or shrubs or any combination of both. Planted areas shall be located along the abutting property lines or in areas that will provide the best screening effectiveness. If trees or large shrubs are used solely as the screening devise, they shall be any evergreen species from the list provided by the zoning administrator which, under normal growing conditions, will attain a minimum height of six feet and a canopy spread of ten feet within three years. They shall be planted a minimum of 20 feet on center as shown in the following illustration: 

                  If trees are used in combination with shrubs, they may be of any species from the list provided by the zoning administrator. Small trees shall be planted 30 foot on center, and large trees 40 foot on center as shown in the following illustration. Shrubs shall be any evergreen species from the list provided by the zoning administrator planted four feet on center as shown in the following illustration. Shrubs shall initially be of any size, which would normally attain a minimum height of six feet within three years after planting. 

                  Walls. Walls shall be of masonry construction and a minimum height of eight feet. The wall shall be placed on the edge of the buffer nearest the most intense land use. 
                  Fences. Fences shall be a minimum of eight feet in height and constructed of standard wood fencing materials and methods or chain link with woven inserts that will provide 90 percent visual blockage as shown in the examples provided by the zoning administrator. The fence shall be placed on the edge of the buffer nearest the most intense land use. 
                  Berms. Earthen berms shall have a minimum height of six feet. 
                  7.2-8.  Variances. The requirements of this article may be waived by city council or zoning board of appeals, depending, upon circumstances, if it is clearly demonstrated that the existing topography and/or vegetation will achieve the purposes of this article; or it clearly demonstrated that for topographic reasons, no required screening device could possibly screen the ground level activities of the use from the first floor view of the residential structure abutting the use. 
                  Sec. 7.3. - Location of buffers. 
                  Buffers shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel along the side and/or rear lot lines. Buffers shall not be located on any portion of existing, dedicated, or reserved public or private street right-of-way. 
                  Sec. 7.4. - Use of buffers. 
                  A buffer may be used for some forms of passive recreation such as pedestrian, bike or equestrian trails, or as a stormwater retention area provided that: 
                  7.4-1.  No planted materials shall be eliminated. 
                  7.4-2.  The total width of the required buffer area shall be maintained. 
                  Sec. 7.5. - Maintenance. 
                  The responsibility for maintenance of buffers shall remain with the owner of the property. Any required plant that has died shall be replaced. Maintenance of planted areas shall consist of mowing, removal of litter and dead plant materials, and necessary pruning. Fences and walls shall be kept in a condition that meets the requirements of this article. 
                  Sec. 7.6. - Failure to comply with these provisions. 
                  See articles 14 and 17 of this ordinance for enforcement and penalty provisions. 
                  Sec. 7.7. - Surety for buffer installation. 
                  When the date for issuing a certificate of occupancy does not coincide with the planting conditions that are necessary to install a required buffer, the zoning administrator shall accept a letter of credit or other acceptable surety for the buffer installation. Such surety shall be in the amount and form satisfactory to the zoning administrator and shall certify the following: 
                  a.  That the creditor does guarantee funds in an amount to cover the cost of installing all buffers as estimated and approved by the zoning administrator; 
                  b.  That in case of failure of the developer to complete the specified improvements, the creditor shall pay the government immediately, and without further action, such funds as are necessary to finance the completion of those improvements up to the limit of the secured credit; and 
                  c.  That the letter of credit or other surety may not be withdrawn or reduced in amount until released by the zoning administrator after final inspection and certification of approval of the buffer. 
                  ARTICLE 8. - SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS 

                  Sec. 8.1. - Lots of record. 
                  Any lot of record which is legal at the time of the adoption or amendment of this ordinance, may be used, subject to the following exceptions and modifications. 
                  8.1-1.  Use of substandard lots. Where the owner of a lot at the time of the adoption or amendment of this ordinance does not own sufficient area and width to enable him to conform to the dimensional requirements of this article, such lot may be used as a building site. 
                  8.1-2.  Individual lot not meeting minimum lot dimension requirements. In addition to section 8.1-1, in any residential district, any lot of record existing at the time of adoption or amendment of this ordinance which has a width or area less than that required by this ordinance may be used as a building site for a single-family dwelling only. In the case of such a lot, when it is not possible to provide the required side yards and at the same time build a minimum width single-family dwelling, the zoning board of appeals is empowered to hear the request for a minimum variance. 
                  8.1-3.  Adjoining lots. When two or more adjoining lots of record with continuous frontage are in one ownership at any time after the adoption or amendment of this ordinance and such lots, individually, have an area or width that is less than required by this ordinance, then such contiguous lots shall be considered as a single lot or several lots of the minimum width and area required in the zoning district in which they are located.

                  8.2-1.  Lot area. Hereafter, no lot shall be reduced in size so that lot width, size of yards, lot area per family or any other requirement of this ordinance is not maintained. This limitation shall not apply: 
                  a.  When a portion of a lot is acquired for a public purpose. 
                  b.  To dormitories, fraternities, sororities and other similar living quarters which are accessory to a permitted use and which have no cooking facilities in individual rooms.

                  8.2-4.  Side yards. 
                  a.  For the purpose of the side yard regulations, a group of commercial buildings separated by common or party walls shall be considered as one building occupying one lot.

                  8.10-7.  Advertising. No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower. 
                  8.10-8.  Visual impact. 
                  a.  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  b.  At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities [in] to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  c.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  d.  Towers clustered at the same site shall be of similar height and design. 
                  e.  Towers shall be at a minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing similar tower supported antenna, and shall be free-standing where the negative visual effect is less than would be created by use of a guyed tower. 
                  8.10-9.  Landscaping. Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the tower compound from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property and shall be as follows: 
                  a.  A buffer area no less than six feet wide shall commence at the property line. 
                  b.  The buffer zone is to consist of materials of a variety which can be expected to grow to form a continuous hedge at least five feet in height within two years of planting. 
                  c.  Trees and shrubs in the vicinity of guy wires shall be of a kind that would not exceed 20 feet in height or would not affect the stability of the guys, should they be uprooted, and shall not obscure visibility of the anchor from the transmission building or security facilities and staff/maintenance. 
                  d.  Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  e.  In lieu of those standards, the enforcement officer may allow use of an alternate detailed plan and specifications for landscape and screening, including plantings, fences, walls and other features designed to screen and buffer towers and accessory uses. The plan shall accomplish the same degree of screening achieved by the provisions above, except as lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes and/or for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived by the planning commission.

                  Cross reference— Environment, ch. 38. 

                  Sec. 10.1. - Purpose. 
                  The intent of this article is to establish minimum development standards and criteria that will afford reasonable protection of environmentally sensitive natural resources found throughout the City of Ellijay. Based on the findings of the Joint Comprehensive Plan for Gilmer County and Cities of Ellijay and East Ellijay, it has been determined that the wise management of these resources as defined in this article is essential to maintaining the health, safety, general welfare and economic well-being of the public. 
                  (Ord. of 7-16-2001) 
                  Sec. 10.2. - Establishment of environmental conservation districts. 
                  The City of Ellijay's environmental conservation districts shall include the following districts: 
                  Wetlands protection district 
                  Coosawattee River corridor protection district 
                  Mountain protection district 
                  Water supply watershed protection district 
                  The boundaries of these environmental conservation districts are shown on a set of maps designated as "Overlay District" and are included as part of the city's official zoning district map, which is on file with the City of Ellijay Clerk for public use. 
                  (Ord. of 7-16-2001) 
                  Sec. 10.3. - Wetlands protection district. 
                  10.3-1.  Findings of fact. The wetlands within the City of Ellijay are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia. 
                  10.3-2.  Purpose. The purpose of this district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, flood plain and erosion control, ground water recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas. 
                  10.3-3.  Definitions. In addition to the definitions provided in article 3 of this ordinance, the following definitions shall apply to this article: 
                  Generalized wetlands map. The current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps for the City of Ellijay, Georgia. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland. An area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the Army Corp of Engineers. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland determination. A delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended. 
                  Regulated activity. Any activity which will, or which may reasonable be expected to result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  Wetlands. Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrological vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. 
                  10.3-4.  District delineation. The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the City of Ellijay that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetland Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetland map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands with the City of Ellijay and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this ordinance does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  10.3-5.  Wetland development permit requirements. No regulated activity or use, except those identified in section 10.3-6, will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without a local development permit from the enforcement officer. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the enforcement officer using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corp of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter of permission. Furthermore, the local development permit will only be granted if the proposed use is in compliance with underlying zoning district requirements and other provisions of this ordinance. 
                  10.3-6.  Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted by right within the wetland protection district to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein. 
                  a.  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission. (Section 404 does not require permits for normal, ongoing silvicultural activities. However, section 404 does list some required road construction best management practices that must be followed in order to qualify for such an exemption.) 
                  b.  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish, or other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the State of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
                  c.  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
                  d.  Natural water quality treatment or purification. 
                  e.  Normal agriculture activities including the planting and harvesting of crops and pasturing of livestock. Such activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. 
                  f.  Education, scientific research, and nature trails. 
                  10.3-7.  Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited in a wetland protection district: 
                  a.  Handling and storage areas for the receiving and storage of hazardous materials. 
                  b.  Hazardous waste, hazardous materials and solid waste disposal facilities. 
                  (Ord. of 7-16-2001) 
                  Sec. 10.4. - Coosawattee river corridor protection district. 
                  10.4-1.  Findings of fact. River corridors are the strips of land that flank major rivers in Georgia. These corridors are of vital importance to Georgia in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable for habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb flood waters. 
                  10.4-2.  Purpose. The Coosawattee River has been designated as a protected river by the State of Georgia. The purpose of the major river protection district is to establish measures to preserve an adequate supply of safe drinking water which is necessary to protect the health and welfare of the public as well as to provide for the state's future growth. 
                  10.4-3.  Definitions. In addition to the definitions provided in article 3 of this ordinance, the following definitions shall also apply to this article: 
                  Natural vegetative buffer or buffer area. A river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, "The Natural Environments of Georgia." Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor to maintain those species. 
                  Perennial river/stream. A river/stream or section of a river/stream that flows continuously throughout the whole year. 
                  Protected river. Any perennial river or watercourse with an average flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second as determined by the appropriate U.S. Geological Survey documents. 
                  Public utility. A service or services provided by a public utility company or private entity which provides such service or services and all equipment and structures necessary to provide such services. 
                  River bank. The rising ground, bordering a river or a stream, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
                  River corridor. 
                  All land, inclusive of islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-440 through 12-5-457), or the Coastal Marshland Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-280 through 12-5-293), in areas of a protected river and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river measured from the river banks. 
                  The 100-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the river banks, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured 100-foot-wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated the same as the river corridor and shall be included within the river corridor protection district. 
                  Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For purposes of this ordinance, the river corridor shall be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for the Joint Comprehensive Plan for Gilmer County and Cities of Ellijay and East Ellijay. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the review period will be shown by revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next comprehensive plan review by the department of community affairs. 
                  Sensitive Natural Area. Any area, as identified now or hereafter by the department of natural resources, which contains one or more of the following: 
                  a.  Habitat, including nesting sites, occupied by rare or endangered species; 
                  b.  Rare or exemplary natural communities; 
                  c.  Significant landforms, hydroforms, or geological features; or 
                  d.  Other areas so designated by the department of natural resources; and which are sensitive or vulnerable to physical or biological alteration. 
                  10.4-4.  District delineation. The Coosawattee River Corridor Protection District is hereby established, which shall comprise all land in the areas of the river corridor as defined in 10.4-3 starting from the confluence of the Ellijay and Cartecay Rivers in Ellijay to Carter's Lake. This district shall be further defined and delineated on the Coosawattee River Corridor Protection District Overlay Map, which is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this ordinance by reference. 
                  10.4-5.  Protection criteria. Construction is prohibited and a natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained at all times in the river corridor, except as provided in 10.4-6. The natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land disturbing activity. 
                  10.4-6.  Permitted uses. No development or other land disturbing activity will be allowed to occur within the Coosawattee River Corridor Protection District except for the following uses: 
                  a.  Construction within the buffer area is prohibited except as provided herein. 
                  b.  Septic tank and septic tank drainfields are prohibited in the river corridor except as expressly provided in section 10.4-6 c. of this ordinance. 
                  c.  Single-family dwellings, including the usual appurtenances are permitted in the buffer area subject to the following conditions: 
                  -  Each dwelling is located on at least two acres (for purposes of this ordinance, the size of the tract of land shall not include any area that lies within the protected river); 
                  -  There shall be only one dwelling on each two acre or larger tract of land; and, 
                  -  Although septic tanks for dwellings can be located in the buffer area, septic tank drainfields must be located outside of the buffer area. 
                  d.  Industrial or commercial uses existing prior to the adoption of this ordinance, providing they do not impair the drinking quality of water and meet all other state and federal environmental rules and regulations. 
                  e.  Road and utility crossings, providing the construction of these crossings meet the requirements of the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, and all applicable local ordinances on soil erosion and sedimentation control.

                  (Ord. of 7-16-2001) 
                  Sec. 10.5. - Mountain protection district. 
                  10.5-1.  Findings of fact. The mountainous areas of the City of Ellijay provide a unique character to the area, and form an integral part of the city's aesthetic and physical environment. These mountainous areas are characterized by steep slopes with thin soils that are sensitive to land disturbing activities, which may cause severe erosion and sedimentation of the area's surface waters. Due to their physical dominance on the City of Ellijay's landscape, development of these mountain areas will also affect natural scenic views and vistas, and the general aesthetic character of the City of Ellijay. 
                  10.5-2.  Purpose. The purpose of this district is to establish measures regulating land development that will minimize environmental impacts and visual degradation of natural scenic views and mountain scenery. This is achieved through encouragement of minimal grading on steep sloped areas; requiring the retention of trees, which stabilize steep sloped areas, retain moisture, prevent erosion, and enhance the natural scenic beauty; and, limiting the density and other characteristics of development occurring in these areas. 
                  10.5-3.  District delineation. The mountain protection district is hereby designated, and shall comprise all land that has a slope of 25 percent or greater for at least 500 feet horizontally as shown on a U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle map including crests, summits, and ridge tops, even though such crests, summits and ridges have slopes of less than 25 percent. This district shall be further delineated and defined on the mountain protection district overlay map, which is hereby incorporated and made a part of this ordinance by reference. 
                  10.5-4.  Permitted uses. All uses that are allowed in the underlying zoning districts except those identified in section 10.5-6 are permitted in the mountain protection district subject to the development criteria specified in section 10.5-5. 
                  10.5-5.  District development criteria. 
                  a.  Building height. No structures shall exceed more than 35 feet in height, as measured from the highest point at which the foundation of such structure intersects the ground. This height restriction shall not apply to water, radio, or television towers; to any equipment for the transmission of electricity; to minor vertical projections of a parent building, including chimneys, flagpoles, flues, spires, steeples, belfries, cupolas, antennas, poles, or wires. 
                  b.  Lot size and coverage. 
                  1)  Single-family dwellings shall not be constructed at a density of more than one per acre, and no residential lot shall be less than 100 feet wide at the building line; 
                  2)  Multifamily dwellings shall not be constructed at a density greater than four units per acre. 
                  3)  The maximum impervious surface of a lot or development shall not exceed ten percent. 
                  c.  Tree protection. For all land development activity, excluding commercial timber activities outlined in section 10.5-5d., all trees that exceed eight inches in diameter measured at a point of 4½ feet above ground shall be protected and retained on the site, except for those necessary to accommodate the allowed impervious surface areas. The location of all such trees shall be shown on all plans submitted for approval. 
                  d.  Commercial timber activities. No more than 50 percent of the existing trees that exceed eight inches in diameter, as measured at a point of 4½ feet above the ground, shall be removed from the site. Such tree removal shall abide by the "selection cutting" tree removal method established by the best management practices of the Georgia Forestry Commission. No "clear cutting" of any area is permitted, except where necessary for road construction. All timber harvesting activities must secure a permit from the zoning administrator based upon a timber harvesting plan developed by a registered forester. 
                  10.5-6.  Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited in the mountain protection district: 
                  a.  Handling and storage areas for the receiving and storage of hazardous materials. 
                  b.  Hazardous waste, hazardous materials and solid waste disposal facilities. 
                  (Ord. of 7-16-2001) 
                  Sec. 10.6. - Water supply watershed protection district. 
                  10.6-1.  Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the City of Ellijay and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted urban and suburban development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicants, nutrients, and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
                  10.6-2.  Purpose. The purpose of the water supply watershed protection district regulations is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply for the City of Ellijay that will minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply, and maintain the yield of the water supply watersheds. 
                  10.6-3.  Definitions. In addition to the definitions provided in article 3 of this ordinance, the following definitions shall also apply to this article: 
                  Large water supply watershed. A watershed that contains 100 square miles or more of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake. 
                  Natural buffer. A natural or enhanced vegetated area with no or limited minor land disturbances, such as trail and picnic areas, located adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed. 
                  Perennial river/stream. A river/stream or section of a river/stream that flows continuously throughout the whole year. 
                  Reservoir boundary. The edge of a water supply reservoir defined by its normal pool. 
                  Small water supply watershed. A watershed that contains less than 100 square miles of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake. 
                  Stream corridor. All land within buffer and other setback areas that are established adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed. 
                  Utility. Public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems, railroads or other utilities identified by the Ellijay governing authority. 
                  Water supply reservoir. A government-owned impoundment of water for the primary purpose of providing water to one or more governmentally owned public drinking water systems. This excludes multipurpose reservoirs owned by the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers. 
                  Water supply watershed. An area of land upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water intake. 
                  10.6-4.  District delineation. The Ellijay Water Supply Watershed and Cartecay Water Supply Watershed districts are hereby designated, and shall comprise the land areas that drain to the public water supply intakes permitted to the Ellijay/Gilmer County Water and Sewer Authority and to the City of Chatsworth (Murray County, Georgia) public water supply intake. The boundaries of these districts are defined by the ridge lines of the respective watersheds and the boundary of a radius seven miles upstream of the respective public water supply intakes. These districts shall be further delineated and defined on the water supply watershed protection district overlay map for the City of Ellijay, which is hereby incorporated and made a part of this ordinance by reference. 
                  A.  The Cartecay Water Supply Watershed is a large water supply watershed district. An intake for the Ellijay/Gilmer County Water and Sewer Authority is located on this river. This water supply watershed does not contain a reservoir. 
                  B.  The Coosawattee River is a large water supply watershed. An intake for the City of Chatsworth is located on Carters Lake which is fed by the Coosawattee River. This water supply watershed does not contain a reservoir as defined by this ordinance.

                  Editor's note— Arts. I—VIII of a sign ordinance adopted Mar. 17, 2014 , deleted the former Art. 12, §§ 12.1—12.18, and enacted a new Art. 12 as set out herein. The former Art. 12 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 072604, § 1, adopted July 26, 2004. Prior to adoption of the Mar. 17, 2014 ordinance, Ord. No. 102113, § 1, adopted 10-21-2013, placed a temporary moratorium on sign permits. 

                  Sec. 12.1. - Purpose and scope. 
                  The purpose of this article is to provide standards to safeguard public health, property, and welfare by regulating the location, size, illumination, construction, erection, maintenance, and quality of materials of all exterior signs, and to ensure that signs will not confuse, mislead, or obstruct the vision necessary for traffic and pedestrian safety. 
                  The City of Ellijay ("city") acknowledges, too, that preservation of the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the citizenry of the city requires the preservation and protection of the visual attractiveness and aesthetic characteristics of existing streets and neighborhoods throughout the community. Signage controls are included in this article to further the aesthetic values of the community by: 1) protecting neighborhood property values, 2) maintaining the traditional character of historic neighborhoods and districts; 3) avoiding the visual degradation of the city's irreplaceable scenic and environmental resources, and 4) promoting city's continued economic growth by encouraging high quality commercial development. 
                  Reasonable, orderly, and effective display of signs provides vital support for economic development and helps create a positive community image that will attract desirable business and industry to the Ellijay area. The uncontrolled use of signs with their variable sizes, heights, and illumination demand attention to help avoid potential dangers to moving traffic and pedestrians. In addition, uncontrolled sign placements can be destructive to adjacent property values so that clutter replaces the intrinsic values of the property and diminishes the effectiveness of the signs as they compete with each other. Absent regulations, competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs undermines the sign owner's original purpose of presenting a clear message to the public. 
                  For these reasons, it has become necessary in the public interest to regulate the sizes, heights, locations, types, and other pertinent physical features of exterior signs in the city while simultaneously acknowledging free speech as a First Amendment constitutional right. Balancing the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs, while protecting the right of the public against unrestricted proliferation of signs is acknowledged as the goal of the city. Such reasonable regulations also further the policy implementation of the city's adopted comprehensive plan, especially regarding impacts on quality land use development in the area.

                  ( Ord. of 3-17-2014, Art. II ) 
                  Sec. 12.3. - General requirements. 
                  (a)  Applicability. The location of signs shall conform with applicable state law. In general, all signs shall be located on private property. No business premise or billboard sign shall be permitted within any street or road right-of-way. 
                  (1)  It shall be unlawful to erect or place any sign which does not conform to the requirement of this article or as otherwise provided for nonconforming signs by this article. 
                  (2)  The requirements of this article shall apply to all signs that are visible from a street, public right-of-way, or property in public ownership, regardless of zoning district. 
                  (3)  The City of Ellijay is genuinely interested in marketing the inner city as the mountain community that has long been its history. Growth has caused the improvement of some transportation corridors for the more efficient movement of goods and services and public safety, and the roundabout in the heart of the Central Business District (CBD) is an example of one modern improvement while some corridors are wider, often with a middle turning lane. While signage is a part of marketing, the proliferation of signage without regulation negatively impacts the mountain image of the community which is attempting to serve those persons that live in the community and those who would choose to visit periodically as tourists. As such, the City of Ellijay especially values for signage purposes, the area designated by zoning as the Central Business District (CBD), the Downtown Historic District, and a designated transportation overlay district that is specific to certain vehicle travel corridors. These areas may be subject to special signage regulations as stated hereafter. 
                  The transportation/signage overlay corridor includes all of those properties that have immediate frontage upon, or any portion of a property that lies within 300 feet of either side of, the following public street rights-of way: 
                  a.  Dalton Street from the corporate limits to the CBD roundabout; 
                  b.  Boardtown Road from the corporate limits to its intersection with Dalton Street; 
                  c.  North Main Street from the intersection with Lois Parks Drive/McCutchen Street to the CBD roundabout; 
                  d.  River Street from the corporate limits to the CBD roundabout; and 
                  e.  South Main Street from the intersection of Bobcat Trail to the CBD roundabout. 
                  (b)  Measuring signs. 
                  (1)  Display area. See definition for display area in section 12.2. The display area is measured geometrically in square feet, and is the area within the smallest regular geometric shape that contains the entire sign copy. The maximum allowed sign size of this article requires the summation of multiple display areas mounted on any sign structure that are readable from a single direction. 
                  (2)  Height of signs. Except as otherwise provided in this article, the height of a sign at its highest point above ground level may be no greater than 20 feet above the adjacent ground. The following rules shall apply in determining adjacent ground: If the base of the sign structure is below the grade of the adjacent roadway, the sign height is measured from the elevation of the adjacent roadway that is nearest to the sign structure. The ground shall not be altered for the sole purpose of providing additional sign height. 
                  (3)  Setback. For the purposes of this article, the setback requirements reference the minimum distance from a street right-of-way line required for the placement of a sign structure. For side or rear line setbacks in all zone districts, a sign structure shall comply with a minimum setback of ten feet from the property line, but in no case shall the sign structure be placed on the property line, nor shall the sign display area extend across any property line, required buffer, or over a public right-of-way, except as may be allowed in the CBD zone district. 
                  (c)  Lighting restrictions. 
                  (1)  The light from illuminated signs shall be established in such a way that adjacent properties and roadways are not adversely affected and that no direct light is cast upon adjacent properties and roadways, including security lighting that creates a visual distraction to pedestrians or motor-vehicles moving along public thoroughfares. 
                  (2)  No illuminated signs shall be constructed or maintained within 50 feet of any dwelling within a residential district. 
                  (3)  No sign shall be erected that contains, or is illuminated by any flashing, intermittent, or moving light or lights except an electronic message board. 
                  (d)  Special restrictions. 
                  (1)  It shall be unlawful to post any signs or advertisements on any building, fence, or property belonging to another without the written consent of the owner thereof. Such consent shall be exhibited to the code enforcement officer on demand by the person erecting, constructing, or maintaining the sign. 
                  (2)  All signs must be professionally lettered with block letters or professional script and constructed on a material that is weather-resistant and sturdy in form, so as to resist rapid degradation of appearance and structural integrity. 
                  (3)  No sign shall contain colors that are neon or fluorescent in nature. 
                  (4)  Corner lots. For business premises having one street frontage, there shall only be one free-standing or shared sign per parcel along the street right-of way. However for those business premises fronting on more than one street, one free-standing sign or shared sign shall be allowed along not more than two street frontages. In such cases, the free-standing signs shall be equal in size. However, if an existing free-standing or shared sign is nonconforming in size on one street frontage, and a second free-standing or shared sign is desired on another street frontage, the second sign shall comply with current size requirements of the ordinance. Further, this subsection is not applicable to a vacant/undeveloped corner lots, which shall be limited to only one permanent free-standing sign as otherwise provided in this article. 
                  (5)  Subdivision of parcels. For all signs, subdivision (one lot divided into two or more lots) of a parent tract intended for the purpose of creating a parcel for sale, lease, or legacy, and intended only for the placement of a sign shall not exempt such parcel from the signage regulations that are applicable to the parent tract. Further, a subdivision of a tract to create a parcel for construction of a new business premise shall require the business premise to be ready for occupancy before any new signage may be erected. 
                  (e)  Corner visibility clearance. In any district, no sign or sign structure (above a height of four feet) shall be maintained within 15 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way lines of two streets, or of a street intersection with a railroad right-of-way. However, a sign structure (example: pole support) not more than ten inches in diameter, if located on a corner lot where services are provided to the motoring public, may be located within the required corner visibility area if all other requirements of this article are met and the lowest elevation of the sign surface is at least ten feet above the ground level. 
                  ( Ord. of 3-17-2014, Art. III ) 
                  Sec. 12.4. - Regulation of signs. 
                  The following provisions apply to all uses in all zone districts except as may be specified elsewhere in this article. 
                  (1)  Prohibited signs. The following signs or sign types are prohibited throughout the City of Ellijay in all zone districts, unless otherwise noted. 
                  a.  Animated signs or rotating signs. 
                  b.  Portable signs, however, such a sign may be used on grand openings for a period not to exceed four weeks.

                  d.  Signs which contain words, pictures or statements which are obscene, as defined by O.C.G.A. § 16-12-80. 
                  e.  Signs which simulate an official traffic control or warning sign or hides from view any traffic or street sign, signal or public service sign that otherwise interferes with the safe and orderly movement of traffic. 
                  f.  Signs which emit or use in any manner any sound capable of being detected on any traveled road or highway by persons that are able to hear. 
                  g.  Signs erected by nailing, fastening, painting, or affixing the sign in any manner to any tree, a fence post, or any other post or rail used for any other support purpose (guard rail, mail boxes, safety rails, etc.), curb, utility pole or utility box, rock, retaining wall, or fence or other natural or man-made structure. 
                  h.  Signs which advertise any activity, service, or product prohibited by the laws or regulations of the United States, the State of Georgia, or by the ordinances or resolutions of the City of Ellijay. 
                  i.  Abandoned signs. Sign structures and sign display areas, functioning as both free-standing and building signs, that are either nonconforming when a business premise fails, closes, or changes to another business premise or remains when a business premise fails, closes, or changes to another business premise, shall be removed in total. 
                  j.  Flashing signs. 
                  k.  No sign shall be erected or maintained which obstructs any fire escape, any means of ingress/egress or ventilation, or which prevents free passage from one part of a roof to any other part thereof; nor shall any sign be attached in any form shape or manner to a fire escape. 
                  l.  Any sign or sign structure that is unsafe, or constitutes a hazard to safety or health by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, or abandonment, or is not kept in good repair, or is likely to cause electrical shocks to persons expected to come in contact with the sign or sign structure. 
                  m.  Billboards in the zones identified as the Central Business District and the Office/Restricted Commercial District, in the Downtown Historic District, and in the transportation/signage overlay district as designated in subsection 12.3(a)(3). 
                  (2)  Permanent signs. The following sign types, related to functional business premises, require the issuance of permits unless otherwise stated by this article. 
                  a.  Free-standing signs. Generally, such signs shall only be located on property in multi-family residential (R-3), commercial, or industrially zoned areas, unless otherwise stated.

                  Larger buildings. A non-residential building containing a gross floor area of 50,000 square feet or more, may have multiple building signs on any facade, visible to a street right-of-way, and the total sign display area per facade shall not exceed ten percent of each facade. 
                  c.  Billboard signs. 
                  1.  Billboard signs are permanent free-standing signs only allowed on commercial or industrially zoned parcels along state or federal highways, except as otherwise prohibited by this article. No billboard shall be placed on any lot which contains any existing free-standing sign. 
                  2.  Size. Billboards shall not exceed 100 square feet in total display area nor more than 25 feet in height, and shall be shaped not to exceed 15 feet in length. 
                  3.  Form and number. Billboard signs shall not be placed side-by-side or stacked. A sign at a single location, whether back-to-back or "V" formation, shall be the same height above the highway surface. 
                  4.  Height and setback. All billboard signs shall be a minimum of ten feet above adjacent street pavement grade measuring from the lower portion of the sign face. Billboard signs shall not extend more than 25 feet in height above the adjacent ground. The edge of the display area for any sign structures shall be not less than ten feet from any property or right-of-way line. 
                  5.  Spacing. Billboard signs shall be spaced a minimum of 1,000 feet apart measured on the same side of the roadway and from the closest point relative to each other. Further, no billboard shall be located within 500 feet of residentially zone properties, nor shall a billboard be visible to any public park, public playground, public recreation area, National Forest, designated scenic area, or cemetery that is located within 500 feet of the proposed sign location. 
                  6.  Illumination. All illuminated signs shall use base mounted fluorescent or mercury vapor lights and shall be activated by photo-electric cells and shall be so directed as to avoid any potential traffic hazard. Additional lighting including but not limited to neon, animation and running lights are prohibited. 
                  7.  Extrusions prohibited. Extrusions beyond the face of any billboard, excluding aprons, are prohibited. 
                  (3)  Temporary/special event signs. Signage may periodically be needed for a short duration rather than permanent usage. To avoid the unfettered proliferation of signage that could easily contribute to litter and blight to the detriment of property values and business opportunity in all zone districts, the city finds it necessary to manage such signage with the issuance of permits that are tied to a prescribed set of rules for the various signs that may fall in this particular category. These signs shall not be erected within the public right-of-way and shall be located on private property with the permission of the property owner. 
                  Only one permit shall be issued to cover all temporary signs. The maximum number of temporary permits to be issued to a single parcel in a multi-family, commercial, or industrial district shall be four per year for a period of time not to exceed ten days for each permit issued. Not more than one special event permit shall be issued per calendar quarter per business premises. 
                  Banners and standard information signs are allowable as temporary signs and should be spaced 300 feet apart. 
                  (4)  Signs exempt from permit requirements. 
                  a.  The following types of signs shall be exempt from the permit requirements of this article: 
                  1.  Permanent free-standing signs, having a sign area of less than four square feet each, provided it is located five feet from the public right-of-way, does not block vehicle sight visibility, and does not exceed three feet in height. A single property/parcel is limited to not more than six such signs. 
                  2.  Seasonal displays, located outside of the public right-of-way, that are erected for a maximum period of 60 days, not more than twice a year. 
                  3.  Non-illuminated wall signs, not larger than two square feet. 
                  4.  Temporary signs related to a newly opened business shall be allowed for 30 days and its display areas shall be limited to three feet high and not more than 45 square feet. 
                  b.  Flagpoles in residentially zoned districts shall not exceed 25 feet in height or the height of the primary structure, whichever is less. Flagpoles in commercial or industrial zoned districts shall not exceed 60 feet in height. The size of any flag shall not exceed 50 percent of the vertical height. (Example: The flagpole is 25 feet high × .50 = a flag not larger than 12.5 square feet.)

                  Sec. 12.5. - Nonconforming uses. 
                  Except as provided in this article, all signs shall be subject to the provisions below, governing nonconforming uses or sign structures. Such provisions, however, shall not be construed to prevent a legally operating nonconforming use from using signs otherwise permitted for similar conforming uses. 
                  (1)  Continuance of nonconforming uses. The lawful use of land area or sign structure existing at the time of enactment of or subsequent amendment to this article may be continued subject to the following restrictions even though such use does not conform with the provisions of this article. 
                  Existing nonconforming sign structures shall not be: 
                  a.  Changed to another nonconforming sign; 
                  b.  Torn down and rebuilt or moved and rebuilt as a nonconforming sign; 
                  c.  Extended or enlarged; or 
                  d.  Rebuilt, altered, or repaired after damage exceeding 50 percent of the fair market value of the improvements, except when changed conditions beyond the control of the owner render the sign nonconforming or warrant the sign's repair. 
                  For the purpose of administration of this provision, ordinary maintenance of a sign is not deemed to be or constitute an extension or enlargement of the sign; and changing the face of the sign is not deemed a change prohibited by this section. 
                  (2)  Deterioration. Nonconforming signs which have been allowed to deteriorate so as to constitute either an aesthetic nuisance or a safety hazard are subject to removal pursuant to section 12.7. A sign shall be deemed to be deteriorated if the paint on its face is faded, cracked or peeling; if removable letters on the changeable copy board are missing or in disarray; if plastic panels are missing, broken or stained; if the sign copy is unreadable, or not relevant to an active business premise or current event; if the sign face or its supporting frame work is rusty or in need of paint; if the area surrounding the sign base is not maintained and kept free of weeds and debris; or if the sign is in need of structural repair. 
                  (3)  Abandonment/business closure. All nonconforming signs which have been abandoned, shall be removed in their entirety by the record owner of the building or the person who obtained the sign license, whomever owns the sign or portion thereof, within 60 days after the business using the sign closes or ceases to operate on the premises where the sign is located. Further, if a nonconforming business premises closes, or the nonconforming business premise/property ownership changes, the signs and sign structures relative to that nonconforming business premise or property shall be removed within 60 days. 
                  ( Ord. of 3-17-2014, Art. V) 
                  Sec. 12.6. - Board of zoning appeals. 
                  (a)  Procedures. An applicant whose permit application has been denied or a permittee who alleges that there is error in any order, requirement, decisions, or determination made by the building inspector/enforcement officer or any other administrative official in connection with the enforcement of this sign ordinance, may appeal the decision to the mayor and council of Ellijay, who serves as the zoning board of appeals as established by the Ellijay Zoning Ordinance. The board of zoning appeals shall consider an appeal at the next available legal meeting held after the city's receipt of the written application for appeal. If the appeal is not heard at the next meeting it shall be heard at the next regular meeting of the zoning board of appeals thereafter, but in any event no later than 45 days from the date the written notice of an appeal was filed with the building inspector/enforcement officer. The zoning board of appeals shall make a final decision not later than 30 days from the date of the hearing. 
                  All decisions from the board of zoning appeals shall only be rendered after having provided legal notice in the local newspaper providing a minimum of 15 days notice of the public hearing where such appeal will be heard. Such notice shall indicate the decision appealed from or the variance that is requested with time, date, and place for the public hearing. Further, if such appeal or variance request affects a specific property then such property shall also be posted with a sign indicating the general purpose of the public hearing, the current zoning of the property, and providing the time, date and place for the conduct of the public hearing. More specific details regarding the notice and posting requirements for a public hearing can be found in Article 15 of the Ellijay Zoning Ordinance. 
                  (b)  Appeals and variance powers. The duly appointed zoning board of appeals shall have the power to reverse or amend the decision of the building inspector/enforcement officer, and/or authorize a variance from the strict application of this article where such application will result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships to the person owning or having the beneficial use of the property or sign for which the variance is sought. 
                  (c)  Application of the variance power. A variance may be allowed by the board of appeals only in cases involving practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships when the evidence in the official record of the appeal supports all the following affirmative findings: 
                  (1)  That the alleged hardships or practical difficulties or both, are exceptional and peculiar to the property of the person requesting the variance, and result from conditions which do not exist generally throughout the city. 
                  (2)  That the alleged hardships and practical difficulties, or both, which will result from a failure to grant the variance, include substantially more than mere inconvenience or the inability to attain a higher financial return, or both. 
                  (3)  That allowing the variance will result in substantial justice being done: 
                  a.  Considering the public benefits intended to be secured by this article; 
                  b.  The individual hardships that will be suffered by a failure of the board to grant a variance; and 
                  c.  The rights of others whose property would be affected by the allowance of the variance. 
                  (4)  That the requested variance is the minimum variance necessary to allow the applicant to enjoy the rights commonly enjoyed by others similarly situated. 
                  (5)  That granting of the variance would not violate more than one standard of this article and the exceptional circumstances are not the result of action by the applicant. 
                  The above findings of fact shall be made by the board of appeals, which is not empowered to grant a variance without an affirmative finding of fact on the categories above. Every finding of fact shall be supported in the record of the proceedings of the board. 
                  Nothing contained herein shall be construed to empower the board of zoning appeals to change the terms of this article or to add to the signs permitted in any district or to allow any signage that is otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  (d)  Appeals of decisions. Should the appellant wish to appeal the decision of the board of zoning appeals, the appellant must do so by writ of certiorari directly to the Gilmer County Superior Court. There shall be no intermediate or secondary appeal to the mayor and council or any other administrative body. An application for a writ of certiorari must be filed within 30 days of the applicant's receipt of the written decision of the board. 
                  ( Ord. of 3-17-2014, Art. VI ) 
                  Sec. 12.7. - Administration and enforcement. 
                  (a)  Registration/inventory. The enforcement officer/building inspector of the City of Ellijay will, within 90 days after the adoption of this article and prior to the expiration of the signage moratorium that allowed the drafting of this article, prepare a digital photography inventory of those signs deemed to be nonconforming according to the terms of this article. Such inventory shall provide visual evidence as to the general size, location, and type of sign that is considered nonconforming. The registry may also include explanatory notes as to the status determination of any sign. For the sake of the record, such inventory may also include existing free-standing and building signs that are considered conforming signs. 
                  (b)  Sign permit. 
                  (1)  A sign permit is required before a permanent or temporary/special event sign may be erected or attached to, suspended from or supported on a building or structure; and before an existing sign may be enlarged, relocated or materially improved upon to an extent of 60 percent of its total replacement value. All signs using electrical wiring and connections shall require an electrical permit. 
                  Except as specifically excluded from the provisions of this article, it shall be unlawful for any person to post, display, substantially change, or erect a sign in the city without first having obtained a sign permit from the City of Ellijay. 
                  (2)  A sign permit shall be issued by the code enforcement office/building inspector when the plans, specifications and intended use of the permanent sign or part thereof conform in all respects to the applicable provisions of this article, the city building code, and the requirements of the electrical code as certified by the building inspector/enforcement officer and a permit fee has been paid by the applicant. 
                  The administrative application shall be accompanied by plans or such other information [property lines; street names; building location and address; name and address of property owner; distances from building to the road, distances to sign from road, along with a detailed drawing of the sign(s) itself (size and height), and, where applicable, the square footage of each facade and the proposed aggregate sign area; name, address, and phone number of the sign contractor] and such other information as the code enforcement officer/building inspector may reasonably require in the exercise of his duties. 
                  Standardized sign plans may be filed with the building inspector/enforcement officer in fulfillment of this requirement, although site plans to determine the location of a sign shall be filed with each application. The building inspector/enforcement officer shall process the application and either grant or deny the application within 30 business days from the date of receipt of a complete application and payment of the proper fee. The failure of building inspector/enforcement officer to timely act on the application shall be deemed a grant of the application. 
                  (3)  Each permit application shall contain an agreement to indemnify and save the city harmless of all damages, demands or expenses, which may in any manner be caused by the sign(s) or sign structure. 
                  (4)  The city shall deny permits to applicants that submit applications for signs that either do not comply with the provisions of this article, or for incomplete applications, or for applications containing false material statements. Should it be determined that a sign permit was erroneously issued, then such permit is void ab initio. Denial of a permit shall be expressed in writing by the building inspector/enforcement officer before the end of the 30 business days established for review of the application and shall state the reasons for denial of the application. For the purposes of this article, the communication may be made by email or facsimile. Alternatively, the city may personally serve the sign applicant with a copy of the written notice of denial within 30 business days after the city's receipt of the application. The sign applicant shall have the right to appeal the denial of a permit to the city's zoning board of zoning appeals by written notice of appeal as provided in section 12.6 above. 
                  (5)  A sign permit shall become null and void if the sign for which the permit was issued has not been completed within a period of six months after the date of issuance. No refunds will be made for permit fees paid for permits that expired due to failure to erect a permitted sign. Where a permit has expired for failure to erect the sign and a sign is later desired in the same location, a new application must be processed and another fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule in effect at the time of reapplication. 
                  (c)  Permit fee. 
                  (1)  A permit fee shall be paid to the building inspector/enforcement officer for each permit required by this article. The fee shall be in accordance to rate schedule maintained in the office of the building inspector/enforcement officer and the permit rate schedule shall be fixed by the mayor and council from time-to-time addressing the fees for permanent free-standing signs, building signs, and billboards or temporary/special event signs. No permit shall be issued until the exact dimensions and area of the sign have been filed with the building inspector/enforcement officer. For shared signs, each panel shall require a permit fee. 
                  (2)  Permit fees shall not apply to the ordinary servicing, repainting of an existing sign message, cleaning of a sign, nor to changing of advertising on a sign specifically designed for periodic change of message without change in structure. 
                  (d)  Construction and maintenance. All signs, together with all their supports, braces, guys, and anchors, shall be kept in constant repair and unless constructed of galvanized or non-corroding metal, shall be periodically given a protective coating. The area immediately in front of all free-standing signs shall be maintained free of high weeds and debris. In addition to the above provisions, the code enforcement officer may cause any sign or structure which: 
                  (1)  Is structurally unsafe; or 
                  (2)  Constitutes a hazard to safety or health by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation or abandonment; or 
                  (3)  Is deteriorated if the paint on its face is faded, cracked or peeling; if removable letters on the changeable copy board are missing or in disarray; if plastic panels are missing, broken or stained; if the sign face or its supporting frame work is rusty or in need of paint; if the area surrounding the sign base is not maintained and kept free of weeds and debris; or 
                  (4)  Is capable of causing electrical shocks, to be removed following notice of 24-hours to the owner, at the expense of the owner thereof, and to destroy or otherwise dispose of the same. 
                  (e)  Abandonment/business closure. There are legitimate municipal concerns to avoid the unfettered proliferation of signage that could easily contribute to litter and blight, and public safety problems to the detriment of surrounding property values and business opportunity in all zone districts. The city therefore finds it necessary to manage and regulate all visible sign copy and sign structures remaining on-site where a business closes or is discontinued. If a business closes or is discontinued, all visible sign copy and sign structures relative to the past business premises shall be removed within 60 days. However, permanent signs applicable to a business temporarily suspended because of a change in ownership or management of such business shall not be deemed abandoned unless the property remains vacant for a period of six months. 
                  (f)  Enforcement. If any sign is erected or maintained in violation of the provisions of this article, the building inspector/enforcement officer shall have the power to give the owner thereof written notice of such violation, said notice to include a brief statement of the particulars in which such violation is to be remedied. If a sign has been registered with the building inspector/enforcement officer, notice to the registered owner or the person or firm receiving the permit shall be sufficient. If a sign has not been registered and the owner is not known, affixing a copy of the notice to the sign, graphic structure, or building for a period of ten days shall be sufficient. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the interest of safety, any official or employee or agent of the city at the direction of the code enforcement shall have the authority to remove and dispose of any sign placed within the public right-of-way without notice to the owner. 
                  If such a violation is not remedied within 30 days after such notice, the owner shall remove the sign immediately or be subject to a $150.00 a day fine for each day the sign remains. If the sign is not removed by the owner, the building inspector/enforcement officer shall have the right to remove or arrange for removal of such sign at the expense of the owner. The cost of removal of the sign by city shall constitute a lien against the property and shall be recoverable in the same manner as city property taxes. Upon removal, the city may destroy or otherwise dispose of the same. 
                  (g)  New zoning districts. If a new zoning district is created after the initial enactment of this article or subsequent amendment, no signs shall be permitted therein until this article shall be amended to include such zone district. 
                  (h)  Annexations. Existing signs on the property of newly annexed territory that were legally erected under the county ordinance or the lack thereof, which would become nonconforming under this article upon annexation by the city shall be allowed to remain, provided that such sign shall be registered with the city within 90 days of annexation. 
                  ( Ord. of 3-17-2014, Art. VII ) 
                  Sec. 12.8. - Adoption and amendments. 
                  (a)  Adoption and amendment. This article shall both be adopted and amended hereafter, only after the mayor and council shall have authorized the Ellijay Planning Commission or equivalent (hereafter known as the planning commission) to conduct a public hearing, then review and recommend the adoption or subsequent amendment. After conclusion of the required public hearing (subsection (b)), the planning commission shall have 30 days within which to submit its written recommendation to the mayor and council. If the planning commission fails to submit a written recommendation within the 30-day period it shall be deemed to have approved the adoption or subsequent amendment. 
                  (b)  Public hearing. Before enacting an amendment to this article, the planning commission of the City of Ellijay, Georgia, shall hold a public hearing thereon, and at least 15 days notice of the date, time, place, and purpose shall be published in the legal organ of the City of Ellijay, Georgia. 
                  (c)  Presentment to mayor and council. The mayor and council of the City of Ellijay may proceed to final action on the adoption or subsequent amendment of this article after receiving the written recommendation of the planning commission, even if the 30-day period within which the planning commission must act has not expired.

                  ARTICLE 13. - NONCONFORMITY 

                  Sec. 13.1. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to provide for the continuation and, within a suitable period of time, elimination of existing uses of property that do not conform to the requirements of this ordinance upon its adoption or subsequent amendment. 
                  Sec. 13.2. - Nonconforming use. 
                  Any structure or use of land existing at time of enactment or subsequent amendment of this zoning ordinance, but not in conformity with its use provisions, may be continued with the following limitations: 
                  a.  A nonconforming use may not be changed to another nonconforming use. 
                  b.  A nonconforming use may not be reestablished after discontinuance of that use for one year. 
                  c.  A nonconforming use or structure may not be enlarged beyond its size at the time the use or structure becomes nonconforming. This includes, but is not limited to, the size of the building, the number of employees, operation during other hours of the day or night, the use of additional land, and additional or more powerful equipment. 
                  d.  A nonconforming structure may not be rebuilt, altered, repaired or replaced after incurring damages exceeding 75 percent of the fair market value of the structure at the time immediately preceding such damage occurring. A nonconforming mobile home may not be replaced after it is removed from the property. 
                  13.2-1.  The Ellijay City Council may grant the change, reestablishment or enlargement of a nonconforming use or the enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement of a nonconforming structure upon the following findings: 
                  a.  The change, reestablishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement would be no more detrimental to the surrounding area than the existing or previous use; 
                  b.  The structure cannot be economically modified so as to be suitable for uses in the district; 
                  c.  The structure would have to be removed to permit development of the property for conforming uses; 
                  d.  The structure has such value that removal to permit development of the conforming uses would cause economic hardship to the owner; 
                  e.  The proposed change, reestablishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, replacement or repair would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this zoning ordinance; and 
                  f.  The requirements of the zoning ordinance for rezoning would prevent the current zoning from being changed to a classification that would allow the proposed change, reestablishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement. 
                  13.2-2.  Applications submitted to the Ellijay City Council requesting the change, reestablishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement of a nonconforming use structure shall include the following information: 
                  a.  The applicant shall bear the burden of providing conclusive evidence to the city council that the use or structure is legally nonconforming. The evidence may include, but is not limited to, business licenses, tax receipts, utility bills, telephone bills, IRS documents and affidavits. 
                  b.  The applicant shall submit a plat or an accurate site plan, drawn to scale, showing the dimensions of the lot, size and location of all structures and their distance from all property lines, the names of all streets which the property abuts, and parking spaces. 
                  c.  If the request is for a commercial use or structure, a written description shall be submitted to describe the business. This description shall include hours of operation, number of employees, equipment used, products made or sold, type of signs, and other information as needed for the city council to reach a decision. 
                  d.  The applicant shall provide evidence to the city council on how the proposed change, reestablishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement will comply with the current zoning, health and building requirements. 
                  13.2-3.  If the requested change, reestablishment, enlargement, rebuilding, alteration, repair or replacement is approved, the Ellijay City Council may place conditions on the approval to ensure protection of the surrounding area. The applicant is responsible for conformance with these conditions.

                  Cross reference— Administration, ch. 2. 

                  Sec. 15.1. - Creation and membership. 
                  The zoning board of appeals is hereby established. The word "board" when used in this ordinance shall be construed to mean the zoning board of appeals. The board shall consist of the members of the city council. 
                  (Ord. No. 101804, § 1, 10-18-2004) 
                  Sec. 15.2. - Organization. 
                  The board shall elect one of its members as chairman, who shall serve for one year or until such member is reelected or a successor is elected. Meetings of the board shall be held regularly each month and at such other times as the board may decide. The meetings may be canceled by the chairman if there are no matters to be acted upon by the board. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the enforcement officer and shall be a public record. 
                  Sec. 15.3. - Powers and duties. 
                  The board of appeals shall have the following powers and duties: 
                  15.3-1.  Variances. The board shall hear and decide applications for variances from the development requirements of this ordinance, but only where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece of property, which at the time of adoption of this ordinance, was a lot or plat of record; or where, by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional conditions of a piece of property, the strict application of the said development requirements of this ordinance would result in practical difficulties to, or undue hardship upon the owner of such property. In granting a variance, the board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed building, structure, or use as it may deem advisable so that the purpose of this ordinance will be served. 
                  15.3-2.  Prohibited variances. The board shall not be authorized to grant a density variance or a use variance to permit a use in a district in which the use is prohibited. The board shall not be authorized to grant a variance, which would result in an increase of the impervious surface of a development beyond the prescribed 25 percent requirement established in section 10.6-5, Small water supply watershed, item b. 
                  15.3-3.  Conditions for granting variances. No variance shall be authorized unless the board finds that all of the following conditions exist: 
                  a.  That the special circumstances or conditions applying to the building or land in question are peculiar to such premises and do not apply generally to other land or buildings in the vicinity. 
                  b.  That the granting of the application is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a property right and not merely to serve as a convenience to the applicant. 
                  c.  That the condition from which relief of a variance is sought did not result from action by the applicant. 
                  d.  That the authorizing of the variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property or unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets, increase the danger of fire, imperil the public safety, unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding areas or in any other respect impair the health, safety, comfort, morals or general welfare of the inhabitants of the City of Ellijay. 
                  15.3-4.  Appeals. The board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that there is an effort in any order requirement, development or building permit decision, determination or refusal made by the enforcement officer or other administrative officials in the administration or enforcement of any provisions of this ordinance. Such appeals shall be in accordance with the following: 
                  a.  An appeal to the board of appeals may be taken by any person, firm or corporation aggrieved or by any governmental officer, department, board or agency affected by any decision of the enforcement officer with respect to this ordinance. Such appeal shall be made within ten days following notification of the decision appealed from, by filing with the enforcement officer a notice of appeal and specifying the grounds thereof. The enforcement officer shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
                  b.  An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from unless the enforcement officer certifies to the board of appeals, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his option, cause imminent peril to life and property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
                  c.  The appellant and any public agency or private individual shall be entitled to present evidence on matters before the board. 
                  d.  The board may, in conformity with this ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and to that end shall have all the powers of the enforcement officer. The board may direct the issuance of a permit. It shall be the duty of the enforcement officer to carry out the decisions of the board. 
                  15.3-5.  Special exceptions. To hear and decide the following exceptions to the terms of this ordinance provided that such exceptions shall impose appropriate conditions and safeguards: 
                  a.  Zoning district boundary interpretations as provided in section 5.3. 
                  b.  Temporary use. 
                  c.  Interpretation of uses not listed in table 6.3. 
                  15.3-6.  Conditional uses. Certain uses are not generally allowed in a particular zoning district, or in any other zoning districts, because the special characteristics of such uses create impacts on surrounding areas. Such uses may be allowed under special conditions. The granting of a conditional use does not constitute a permanent change in zoning or use. The conditional use may be forfeited if it does not meet the criteria provided in the following section. Generally, a conditional use shall be compatible with the applicable zoning district under special conditions. 
                  a.  Conditional use approval. Conditional uses shall be permitted subject to an approval by the Ellijay Zoning Board of Appeals according to procedures established in section 15.4. The required review shall determine whether the uses conform to the standards set forth in section 15.3-4b. To ameliorate the impact of a conditional use on surrounding property, no conditional use may be granted without special provisions for conditions, criteria, standards, and, or requirements, as to that particular use. 
                  b.  Conditional use standards. A conditional use shall be approved if it meets all the following factors: 
                  1)  A rezoning to a more intensive zoning district, which contains that use as a use by right, would not be appropriate for the property. 
                  2)  The location and character of the conditional use shall be compatible with the community development pattern and consistent with the needs of the neighborhood. 
                  3)  The conditional use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of the natural environment or of other property in the immediate vicinity, or diminish and impair property values within the surrounding neighborhood. 
                  4)  The conditional use will not increase local or state expenditures in relation to the cost of servicing or maintaining neighboring properties. 
                  15.3-7.  Restricted uses. Because of the special characteristics and impacts some uses of property create on surrounding areas, the board shall have the power to restrict any of the uses set forth in table 6.5 in a particular zoning district for certain pieces of property. The restriction of a use does not constitute a permanent change in zoning or use. Factors used to determine whether a use shall be restricted are as follows: 
                  a.  The restricted use is incompatible with the community development pattern and inconsistent with the needs of the neighborhood. 
                  b.  The restricted use will be injurious to the use and enjoyment of the natural environment or of other property in the immediate vicinity, or diminish and impair property values within the surrounding neighborhood. 
                  c.  The restricted use will increases local or state expenditures in relation to the cost of servicing or maintaining neighboring properties.

                  b.  Location of buildings and other structures, creeks, and easements referenced to the property line of the tract. 
                  c.  North arrow, land district and land lot marker.

                  b.  At least 15 days' notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be sent to the applicant and the owners of all properties abutting or across the street from the property with which the hearing is concerned. In addition, the enforcement officer shall post, in a conspicuous place on the property a sign or signs which shall contain information as to the date, time, and purpose of the hearing before the board, at least 15 days before the hearing. However, acts of vandalism or natural occurrences which limit the effectiveness of posting the property for public notice shall not void the proceedings or actions taken under this article. 
                  15.4-3.  Hearing procedure. The board shall adopt such rules and regulations for the conduct of the public hearings as are consistent with state law and are appropriate to its responsibilities, which shall be published and available to the public, including rules on the presentation of evidence. 
                  Sec. 15.5. - Assistance by enforcement officer. 
                  The enforcement officer shall provide such technical and clerical assistance as the board may require, and shall maintain permanent and complete records of the activities of the board. 
                  Sec. 15.6. - Fees. 
                  To defray a portion of the costs occasioned thereby, no appeal from the decision of the enforcement officer and no application for a special exception, variance, or conditional use shall be entered on the docket of, heard by, or ruled by the board until there has been paid to the office of the board by the appellant, an administrative fee, which fee shall be remitted to the Ellijay City Clerk. No fee shall be required for an interpretation of this ordinance when there is a variation between the street layout on the ground and the street layout as shown on the zone district map. Neither the city nor any officer, agent or employee of the city acting in his official capacity, nor any agency of the county shall be required to pay a fee under this article. 
                  Sec. 15.7. - Bylaws. 
                  The board shall adopt such rules for its own internal administration and procedures, including but not limited to, conflict of interest rules, to insure that no member is entitled to rule on or adjudicate a matter in which he has an interest directly or indirectly. 
                  Sec. 15.8. - Appeals from action of the board. 
                  Any party aggrieved by a final judgment or decision of the board may within 30 days thereafter appeal therefrom to the superior court. The appellant shall furnish the board a written notice of appeal specifying the judgment or decision from which appeal is taken. In case of such appeal, the board shall cause a transcript of the proceedings in the case to be certified to the court to which the appeal is taken and the case shall, in such court, be a new trial.

                  ARTICLE 19. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS (PUD) 

                  Sec. 19-1. - Purpose. 
                  It is the intent of this article to encourage flexible and creative concepts in site planning and building arrangements under a unified plan of development rather than under conventional lot-by-lot regulation. The developer benefits from better land utilization, economy in the provision of roads and utilities, and flexibility in design. The community benefits from efficient use of land, preservation of natural amenities and environmentally sensitive areas, and lower development and housing costs. Review and approval of the development plan provides the opportunity to ensure that the development will be in harmony with the character of the neighborhood in which it is located.

                  Sec. 19-6. - Buffer requirements. 
                  To protect the properties adjacent to a PUD, buffer requirements particular to the PUD are necessary to mitigate any potential negative effects. 
                  19-6.1.  Location. A buffer shall, generally, be required along the outer perimeter of the PUD boundary. The buffer is calculated as parallel to the property line, but shall not be located on any portion of existing, dedicated, or reserved public or private street right-of-way. 
                  19-6.2.  Use of buffers. A buffer may be used for some forms of passive recreation such as pedestrian, bike, or equestrian trails, that have a maximum width of five feet; or it can be used to locate a storm water retention area provided that: 
                  a.  No planted materials shall be eliminated; and the total width of the buffer shall be maintained. 
                  b.  A buffer shall not be used for any active recreational uses such as playfields, stables, swimming pools, and tennis courts. 
                  19-6.3.  Buffer design. A buffer plan shall be required as part of the PUD plan and shall be required to show the types and locations of all screening devices within a required buffer. The buffer design shall be integrated with the overall design concept for any project. 
                  a.  Where a required drainage, utility or other easement is partially or wholly within a required buffer, the developer shall design the buffer to eliminate or minimize plantings within the required easement. Such design may necessitate choosing a buffer with more land area. 
                  b.  Existing tree cover and natural vegetation shall be undisturbed except for the addition of supplemental plantings or other approved screening devices, or for the provision of required access or utility crossings as approved by the Ellijay Code Enforcement Officer. Where a buffer is substantially devoid of trees or shrubbery, grading may be allowed within the buffer area prior to replanting or the provision of other screening devices as required. 
                  c.  Landscaping within buffer areas shall be used to screen objectionable views or nuisances, such as parking and services areas, refuse containers, air conditioning units, and transformers. 
                  d.  Grass areas shall be sodded, planted or hydroseeded. If grass seed is used, it shall be a variety suitable to the area that produces complete coverage. 
                  e.  All existing, healthy deciduous and hardwood trees with a caliper of five or more inches at a point of four feet six inches above the natural grade shall be retained, whenever feasible; if not feasible the tree shall be replaced with the same or similar type of tree in accordance with section 19-7.5. 
                  f.  Existing on-site plantings may be credited as landscaped open space meeting the requirements of this section if such plant materials achieve the purposes of this section. 
                  g.  All retained or planted trees shall be protected or situated so as to prevent damage from environmental change resulting from any building or other improvements. 
                  19-6.4.  Permitted buffer types. A PUD buffer shall be a combination of landscaped open space and one or more screening devices. All buffers shall consist of plantings and have a minimum of one tree or two shrubs per 100 square feet of buffer area. The buffer shall be 20 feet wide, consisting of plantings plus either a fence, wall, or berm; or 30 feet wide, consisting of only plantings. 
                  a.  When the uses proposed within a PUD are adjacent to existing dissimilar uses outside the PUD, a buffer is required for the PUD boundary. 
                  b.  When the uses proposed within a PUD are adjacent to vacant land that is zoned for dissimilar uses, the buffer shall be required on the property that allows the more intensive uses to develop. 
                  c.  If due to the topography or other conditions, the Ellijay Code Enforcement Officer determines that the buffer requirements of this article are not adequate, the Officer may then recommend such additional buffer for cause. 
                  19-6.5.  Screening standards. Screening is a method of visually shielding or obscuring one use from another by fence, walls, berms, or densely planted vegetation. Screening shall provide a year-round visual screen from the ground to a minimum of eight feet in height. The following are four types of permitted screening devices: 
                  a.  Plantings. 
                  Plantings shall consist of either trees or shrubs or a combination of both. Trees and shrubs shall be planted with appropriate spacings to allow for proper growth and maintenance. Planted areas shall be located along the abutting property lines, or in areas that will provide the best screening effectiveness. Additional details concerning acceptable plantings are available from the zoning administrator. 
                  Trees shall be any evergreen species. In normal growing conditions, all trees shall attain a minimum height of six feet and a canopy spread of ten feet within three years. When at maturity, trees shall reach a minimum height often ten feet. 
                  Shrubs shall be any evergreen species. When the required buffer is fully installed, all shrubs shall have a minimum height of two feet. In normal growing conditions, all shrubs shall attain a minimum height of five feet and a spread of four feet within three years. 
                  b.  Walls. Walls shall be of masonry construction and a minimum height of six feet. The wall shall be placed on the edge of the buffer nearest the most intense land use. 
                  c.  Berms. Earthen berms shall have a minimum height of six feet when in combination with plantings or a minimum of eight feet in height if it is a stand alone berm. 
                  d.  Fences. Fences constructed of any material, shall provide 90 percent visual blockage. The fence height shall be a minimum of six feet and placed on the edge of the buffer nearest the most intense land use. 
                  19-6.6.  Ownership. Buffers shall be subjected to deed restrictions and subsequently be freely conveyed. They may be transferred to any consenting grantee, provided that any such conveyance adequately guarantees the protection of the buffer for the purposes of this article. 
                  19-6.7.  Buffer maintenance. 
                  The responsibility for maintenance of a required buffer shall remain with the owner of the property. Maintenance is required to ensure the proper functioning of a buffer as a landscaped area which reduces or eliminates nuisance and/or conflict. The owner, occupant, or tenant shall be jointly and severally responsible for installing live and healthy plants. Any required plant which has died or been removed due to disease shall be replaced with like-kind immediately. 
                  Maintenance shall consist of mowing, removal of litter and dead plant materials, and necessary pruning. Natural water courses within a buffer shall be maintained as free flowing and free of debris, and shall not alter existing floodplains. Where trails are allowed within a buffer, they shall be maintained to provide for their safe use. 
                  19-6.8.  Failure to maintain. In the event that the owner fails to maintain the buffer area according to the standards of this article, the City of Ellijay may, following reasonable notice, demand that the maintenance deficiency be corrected and enter the buffer area to provide for maintenance. The cost of such maintenance shall be charged to those persons having the primary responsibility for maintenance of the buffer, and the cost borne by the city shall be enforceable against the property as a judgment lien. 
                  19-6.9.  Surety for buffer installation. Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for a structure, the developer or owner shall provide a surety for all required landscaping materials such that the developer or owner shall guarantee the work for a period of at least one year after the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any use until the required buffer is fully installed and approved or the provisions of the following paragraph are enacted. The issuance of a certificate of occupancy in no way relieves any recipient thereof from the requirements for perpetual maintenance of the buffer. When the date for issuing an occupancy permit does not coincide with the planting season that is necessary to install a required buffer, the zoning administrator shall accept a letter of credit or other acceptable surety for the buffer installation. Such surety shall be in the amount and form satisfactory to the zoning administrator and shall certify the following: 
                  a.  That the creditor does guarantee funds in an amount to cover the cost of installing all buffers as estimated by the developer and approved by the zoning administrator. 
                  b.  That in case of failure on the part of the developer to complete the specified improvements, the creditor shall pay to the City of Ellijay immediately and without further action such funds as are necessary to finance the completion of those improvements up to the limit of credit stated in the letter. 
                  c.  That the letter of credit or other acceptable surety may not be withdrawn or reduced in amount until released by the zoning administrator after the installed buffer has received a final inspection of approval. 
                  Prior to the end of the first year after the buffer installation, the zoning administrator shall make an inspection and notify the owner or developer of any replacement or restoration to be made.

                  19-7.1.  Zoning procedures; public notices and public hearing. An application on a planned unit development is a request for a zoning decision and will be subject to the zoning procedures established in The Zoning Procedures and Standards Ordinance of the City of Ellijay. 
                  19-7.2.  Submission of final site plans and plats. The final site development plans, consistent with any requested modifications, and final plats, consistent with the adopted subdivision regulations, shall be submitted by the developer for action by the Ellijay Planning and Zoning Commission, the final platting authority. 
                  19-7.3.  Major revision of the planned development. Major or substantial changes in an approved planned unit development plan that affects the intent and character of the development, the density or land use pattern, the location or dimensions of streets, or similar substantial changes shall require the developer to submit a written request for revision of the development plan and shall require a new public hearing to review such changes. Actions on the revisions shall be consistent with the Ellijay Zoning Procedures Ordinance. Minor amendments may be reviewed and approved, administratively, by the zoning administrator/building inspector. 
                  19-7.4.  Failure to report revisions. Should any revision in the approved plan not be reported by the developer to the zoning administrator, in writing, the approval of the plan shall stand revoked unless and until the required approval is obtained.

                  19-8.1.  Grading permits. A grading permit shall be required for any proposed planned development before any improvement or grading of land commences. 
                  19-8.2.  Building permits. After approval by the Ellijay Planning and Zoning Commission of the PUD plan and recording of the final plat(s), the building inspector shall issue building permits for the buildings and structures in the planned unit development. 
                  19-8.3.  Control of area following completion. After completion of a planned unit development, the use of land and construction, modification or alteration of any buildings or structures within the area covered by the plan shall be regulated by the approved development plan and the provisions of this resolution. 
                  19-8.4.  Lapse of approval. 
                  a.  Lack of construction. Approval of a site plan for a planned unit development shall lapse one year from the date of the approval of the final plan by the Ellijay Planning and Zoning Commission unless actual construction has been initiated or a request for an extension of one year is granted by the Ellijay Planning and Zoning Commission. Not more than one site plan extension shall be granted. 
                  b.  Default of the developer. If the developer should default regarding the implementation of an approved PUD, the construction approval of an area as a planned unit development shall lapse one year from the date of the default, unless other developer(s) initiate efforts to continue the approved PUD site plan within the one-year period. New developer(s) must submit their revised schedule for construction to the Ellijay Planning and Zoning Commission for acknowledgment and approval.

                  APPENDIX B. - STANDARDS FOR CONSIDERING ZONING DECISIONS

                  1.0.  In ruling on any application for a zoning decision the zoning entity shall balance the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare against the right to the unrestricted use of property. 
                  2.0.  The City of Ellijay shall consider any proposed zoning amendment properly initiated in light of the standards set forth in section 2.1. In evaluating the standards set forth in section 2.1, it shall be the policy of the City of Ellijay to exercise its zoning power in conformity with the policy and intent of "A Joint Comprehensive Plan for Gilmer County, and the Cities of Ellijay and East Ellijay" insofar as that plan is current in its application to the specific property that is the subject of the proposed amendment. It is further the policy of the City of Ellijay to exercise the zoning power for purposes of assuring the compatibility of the use of adjacent and nearby properties and the preservation of the economic value of adjacent and nearby properties while enabling a reasonable use of all property. 
                  2.1.  In matters related to annexation of property into the municipality or changing the zoning district from one zone to another (rezoning), the following standards are deemed relevant: 
                  a)  Whether the proposed amendment would allow a use that is generally suitable for the site compared to the existing land uses and zoning classification of nearby property; consideration of the preservation of the integrity of residential neighborhoods shall be considered to carry great weight; and whether the aesthetics of the existing compared to the proposed use of the property affects the surrounding area; 
                  b)  Whether the proposed amendment would adversely affect the economic value or the uses of adjacent, abutting, and nearby properties; 
                  c)  Whether the extent to which destruction or diminishing of the property values of the subject property promotes the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the general public; 
                  d)  Whether the relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship imposed upon the individual property owner under the current zoning, substantially promotes the general welfare of the public; 
                  e)  The length of time the property has been vacant as zoned considered in the context of land development in the area in the vicinity of the property; 
                  f)  Whether the subject property has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned considering the suitability of the subject property for the proposed zoned purpose; 
                  g)  Whether the zoning proposal is in conformity with the policies and intent of the adopted comprehensive plan, especially regarding land use policies and the future land use map;

                  Sec. 3.3. - Waiver. 
                  When there is a request from a subdivider, in written form, and where the planning commission finds that, due to the special circumstances of a particular plat, the provision of certain required improvements is not requisite in the interest of the public health, safety, and general welfare or is inappropriate to the proposed subdivision, the planning commission may waive such requirements subject to appropriate conditions.

                  4.  The rules, as applicable, of the Federal Highway Administration or Georgia Department of Transportation, if the subdivision or any lot contained therein abuts a state or federally designated highway; 
                  5.  The standards and regulations adopted by all other boards, commissions, and agencies having jurisdiction; and 
                  6.  Where the proposed development is in an area designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a potential flood prone area the developer must comply with all of the provisions of the City of Ellijay flood prevention resolution. 
                  Plat approval may be withheld if a subdivision is not in conformity with the above rules or with the provisions set forth in this ordinance. 
                  Sec. 4.3. - Presubmittal conference. 
                  The presubmittal conference will serve as an informal plan review involving the developer and planning commission staff. The staff at that time shall determine if the submittal constitutes either a major or minor subdivision. The purpose is to permit the subdivider to discuss his concept and proposed design. Further, [the] staff can point out any factors which may have an impact on the proposed development and advise the subdivider of various possibilities before substantial amounts of time and money have been invested in a very detailed proposal which may contain elements contrary to this ordinance. During the presubmittal conference regulations will be distributed, the schedule of commission reviews noted, and department approvals and agency contacts identified. The presubmittal conference is highly recommended for all developers. 
                  Sec. 4.4. - Required subdivision submittals. 
                  All submittals shall be determined to be either an exempt, minor, or major subdivision of land. 
                  4.4-1.  Exempt subdivisions. Divisions of land which have the following characteristics are exempt from the subdivision regulations as set forth in this ordinance (under both circumstances the resulting lot dimensions must conform to the minimum lot dimensions specified in the Ellijay Zoning Ordinance): 
                  a.  The division of land among heirs by judicial decree; 
                  b.  Sale of property to the abutting landowners. 
                  4.4-2.  Minor subdivisions. All subdivisions of land, which front on an existing public or private street; do not require any new or improved street, public water, sewer service, or other utility extensions; and, are not in conflict with any of the provisions of this ordinance. 
                  4.4-3.  Major subdivisions. Major subdivisions of land are those not classified as exempt or minor subdivisions. 
                  Sec. 4.5. - Submittal, review and approval procedure for a minor subdivision. 
                  Anyone requesting approval of a proposed minor subdivision plat shall follow the procedure described below in order to secure approval. 
                  4.5-1.  Submittal requirements. 
                  a.  Submit a final plat which has been prepared in accordance with section 4.6-2.d., together with the prescribed fee and evidence that no taxes or assessments are outstanding against the property, to the review agency staff. 
                  4.5-2.  Review procedures. 
                  a.  The review agency staff will review the plat for compliance with minimum plat specifications (section 4.6-2.d.), design standards (article 5) and conformance with all other applicable rules and regulations (section 4.2). 
                  4.5-3.  Approval procedures. 
                  a.  Upon presenting the proposed final plat to the review staff, all applicable "certificates of approval" shall already be endorsed except for the "certificate for approval of recording." The review agency staff shall approve or deny the final plat and/or site plan within ten working days of its submittal. However, the developer may waive this requirement and consent to an extension of this period. 
                  b.  Where a minor subdivision proposes access to a state highway, the Georgia Department of Transportation shall determine the feasibility of such access (Georgia Code of Public Transportation, section 32-6-151). The review agency staff shall include the requirements of the department of transportation in any action taken upon a proposed minor plat. 
                  c.  If the plat is denied by the review agency staff, the subdivider may request that the planning commission review the plat and/or site plan, pursuant to the submittal and approval procedure contained in section 4.6-2, in which case the action of the planning commission shall be final. 
                  d.  A minor subdivision final plat must be scheduled for review and approval by the planning commission where a developer requests a variance. 
                  Sec. 4.6. - Submittal, review and approval procedure for a major subdivision. 
                  Any applicant requesting approval of a proposed major subdivision shall follow the procedure described below in order to secure approval. 
                  4.6-1.  Preliminary plat. Subsequent to a presubmittal conference with the review agency staff and before any grading, site development or construction begins, the subdivider shall submit a preliminary plat pursuant to the following sequence of submittal, review and approval procedures: 
                  a.  Submittal requirements. 
                  Submit a preliminary plat which has been prepared in accordance with section 4.6-1.d., together with prescribed fee, to the review agency staff. A minimum of five copies of the preliminary plat (seven copies where subdivision proposes access to a state highway) and supporting documentation shall be submitted to the review agency staff. The submission shall occur a minimum of 15 calendar days prior to the meeting date of the planning commission at which the subdivider desires official action. 
                  If a subdivision proposes access to a state highway then the department of transportation shall receive two copies of the proposed plat to determine the feasibility of such access (Georgia Code of Public Transportation, section 32-6-151). The planning commission shall include the requirements of the department of transportation in any action taken upon a proposed plat. 
                  In the event that the subdivider plans to secure approval of his subdivision layout by the Federal Housing Administration or other federal or state agency, it is suggested that such approval be secured prior to the submission of a preliminary plat to the planning commission. 
                  b.  Review procedures. Review of the preliminary plat is the most important step in any development review in order to identify problems or obstacles that will inhibit the proposed development. All applicable departments will conduct individual reviews of the plat. The review agency staff will review the plat for compliance with minimum plat specifications (section 4.6-2.d.), design standards (article 5) and conformance with all other applicable rules and regulations (section 4.2). 
                  c.  Approval procedures. 
                  Within 30 days after the date of review by the planning commission, the preliminary plat shall be approved or disapproved. 
                  Failure to act within 30 days shall be deemed approval of the plat and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the planning commission on demand; provided, however, that the applicant for the planning commission's approval may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of the period. The grounds for disapproval of any plat shall be stated in writing upon the records of the planning commission and a copy of the grounds provided to the subdivider. After official action by the planning commission, a letter shall be issued by the review agency staff to the subdivider notifying the subdivider of the official action. Any conditions attached to the official action shall be stated and if the preliminary plat is denied the reasons for denial shall also be stated. 
                  d.  Preliminary plat specifications. The preliminary plat shall be prepared by a Georgia registered surveyor; if a landscape architect or civil engineer contributed to the plat, then so indicate. The plat shall be drawn at a scale no smaller than 100 feet to an inch. However, where the size of the proposed subdivision exceeds 100 acres the scale may be no smaller than 200 feet to an inch. The plat shall be drawn in permanent ink on reproducible material and shall include:

                  The purpose of good subdivision and site design is to create a functional and attractive development, to minimize adverse impacts, and to ensure that projects will be designed to result in a well-planned community without adding unnecessarily to development costs. 
                  Sec. 5.2. - General principles of design. 
                  5.2-1.  Site analysis. An analysis shall be made of characteristics of the development site, such as site context, geology and soil, topography, climate, ecology, existing vegetation, structures, and road networks, visual features, and past and present use of the site. Development of the site shall be based on the site analysis. To the maximum extent practicable, development shall be located to preserve the natural features of the site, to avoid areas of environmental sensitivity, and to minimize negative impacts and alteration of natural features. 
                  5.2-2.  Suitability of the land. Land which the planning commission finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, adverse earth formations or topography, utility easements or other features which would be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of inhabitants of the land and surrounding areas shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer and approved by the planning commission to solve the problems created by the unstable land conditions. 
                  Sec. 5.3. - General subdivision design standards. 
                  5.3-1.  Monuments. The subdivider shall place permanent reference monuments in the subdivision as required herein and as approved by a licensed surveyor. Monuments shall be located and set as follows: 
                  a.  Monuments shall be located on street right-of-way lines, at street intersections and at the beginning and ending points of curves. 
                  b.  All lot corners shall be marked by iron rods, pipe, or pins at least 18 inches long and five-eighths inch in diameter. 
                  c.  The lines of lots that extend to rivers or streams shall be monumented in the field by iron pins at least 18 inches long and five-eighths inch in diameter or by round or square iron bars at least 18 inches long. Such pins shall be placed at the point of intersection of the river or stream and lot line, with a meander line established not less than 20 feet back from the bank of the river or stream. 
                  d.  All monuments and pins shall be properly set in the ground and approved by a registered surveyor prior to the time the planning commission recommends approval of the final plat or release of the bond where bond is made in lieu of improvements. 
                  5.3-2.  Name of subdivision. The name of the subdivision must have approval of the planning commission. The name shall not duplicate nor closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision. 
                  5.3-3.  Residential development design. 
                  a.  The planning commission may require alternative lot area and dimension setbacks provided that lots conform to the minimum requirements of the Ellijay Zoning Ordinance [appendix A], and provided that such standards shall be appropriate to the type of development permitted. 
                  b.  Every lot shall have sufficient access to it for emergency vehicles as well as for those needing access to the property for its intended use. 
                  c.  The placement of lots in residential developments shall take into consideration topography, privacy, orientation, drainage, and aesthetics. 
                  5.3-4.  Industrial and commercial development design. Commercial and industrial development shall be designed according to the same principles governing the design of residential developments; namely, buildings shall be located according to topography with environmentally sensitive areas avoided to the maximum extent practicable. Factors such as drainage, noise, odor, surrounding land uses and sufficient access shall be considered. 
                  5.3-5.  Circulation system design. The road system shall be designed to permit the safe, efficient and orderly movement of traffic; to meet, but not exceed the needs of the present and future population served; to have a simple and logical pattern; to respect natural features and topography; and to present an attractive streetscape. 
                  5.3-6.  Access by private streets. Private streets may be permitted by the planning commission in subdivision developments where controlled access or privacy is desired by the developer provided such streets are built to the standards described in section 5.6 of this ordinance and meet the following stipulations: 
                  a.  The preliminary and final plats of a development proposing private streets shall show a statement indicating: The street system is private and will not be maintained or improved by City of Ellijay. 
                  b.  The plat review before the planning commission shall also include evidence of the legal formation of a property owners association to be charged with the minimum responsibility for maintenance of the private street. Such legal documentation shall be recorded and referenced as an attachment to the final plat. 
                  c.  The deed for each lot or parcel sold from the plat shall also contain the statement: The maintenance and improvement of the private street providing access to the described lot is the responsibility of the property owner(s) and not the City of Ellijay. 
                  Sec. 5.4. - Special provisions governing unit ownership (condominium) subdivisions. 
                  5.4-1.  General provisions. Whenever a developer, the sole owner, or the co-owners of a building or buildings expressly declare through the submission of a master deed, lease, or plat their desire to submit their property to a regime wherein there is established a horizontal property regime, each such condominium or property regime created for the purpose of sale or transfer of real property is subject to the provisions of these standards. 
                  5.4-2.  Submission of plat required. Prior to the sale or transfer of any property incorporated in the property regime, the developer, sole owner, or co-owners of such property shall submit to the planning commission and obtain their approval of the subdivision plat of such property in the manner prescribed in this ordinance. 
                  Sec. 5.5. - Lot design standards. 
                  All lots hereafter established in connection with the development of a subdivision shall comply with the following design standards: 
                  a.  Lot lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be perpendicular or radial to street lines. 
                  b.  Jurisdictional limits and lot lines. Lots shall not be divided by city or county boundary lines. 
                  c.  Lot access. Each lot created shall have direct abutting access to an approved public or private street. Each lot must front for at least 25 feet upon an approved street. 
                  d.  Building lines. Residential building set-back lines shall be as required in each zone district of the City of Ellijay Zoning Ordinance [appendix A]. 
                  e.  Adequate building sites. Each lot shall contain an adequate building site not subject to flooding and outside the limits of any existing easements or building setback lines required by this ordinance and any existing ordinance as is appropriate. 
                  f.  Panhandle or flag lots. Panhandle or flag lots, of required width and area will be allowed where terrain makes standard design or frontage impossible or impractical. Where such lots are allowed, the street frontage of each panhandle access shall not be less than 25 feet wide and the panhandle access shall be not more than 200 feet long. Not more than two such panhandle access points shall abut each other. 
                  g.  Double- or reverse-frontage lots. Double- and reverse-frontage, unless required by the planning commission, shall be prohibited except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography, orientation, and property size. A planted screen reservation of at least five feet, and across which there shall be no right of access, may be required along the line of lots abutting such a traffic arterial or other disadvantageous use. 
                  h.  Lot grade to street grade. Any lot whose natural grade at the building line is 12 feet or more above the finished grade of the street on which it fronts may be required to be provided with an approved access way to the lot from other than the street upon which it fronts. 
                  i.  Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently large to permit the location of buildings so as to conform to the minimum building setback requirement on both streets. 
                  j.  Lot remnants. Lot remnants shall be prohibited. Such remnant areas shall be added to adjacent lots, rather than remain as unusable parcels. 
                  k.  Easements. Easements shall be provided in subdivisions for the following purposes. 
                  a.  Utility easements. When it is found to be necessary and desirable to locate public utility lines in other than street rights-of-way, easements shall be shown on the plat for such purposes. Such easements shall not be less than 15 feet in width and where possible, shall be centered on rear or side lot lines. 
                  b.  Watercourse and drainage easements. Where a proposed subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, or stream, appropriate provisions shall be made to accommodate stormwater and drainage through and from the proposed subdivision. Such easement shall conform substantially with the lines of said watercourse and be of sufficient width or construction, or both, as to be adequate for the purpose. 
                  l.  Residential lot depth. Residential lot depth shall not be less than 120 feet or more than four times the lot width at the building line. 
                  m.  Commercial and industrial lots. Commercial and industrial subdivisions of land shall be subject to the approval of the planning commission. 
                  n.  Minimum lot dimensions and area. The minimum lot area and the minimum lot width at the front building line shall be as required by the zone districts in the Ellijay Zoning Ordinance [appendix A]. 
                  Sec. 5.6. - Street design standards. 
                  All streets, whether public or private, which shall hereafter be established in connection with the development of a major subdivision shall comply with the following requirements: 
                  5.6-1.  Access to arterials and collectors. Where a subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial or collector route, as defined on the Georgia DOT Functional Classification Map, the planning commission may require that access to such street be limited by: 
                  a.  The subdivision of lots so as to back on the arterial or collector street and front on a parallel local street (see illustration 1 in the appendix); 
                  b.  A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the arterial or collector street; or 
                  c.  A frontage or marginal-access street (see illustration 2 in [this] appendix). 
                  5.6-2.  Reserve strips. The creation of reserve strips adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to deny access from adjacent property to such street shall generally not be permitted. However, in extraordinary circumstances the planning commission may allow creation of a reserve strip to enable a more appropriate pattern of lots or streets. Where such is created the planning commission must agree to any and all future depositions of same. A notation to this effect shall be entered on the final plat or approved as an auxiliary instrument attached thereto. 
                  5.6-3.  Arrangement of continuing and dead-end streets. Where a subdivision will contain temporary or permanent dead-end streets they shall be designed as follows: 
                  a.  Arrangement of continuing streets. The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of major streets between adjacent properties when such continuation is necessary for convenient movements of traffic, effective fire protection, efficient provision of utilities, and when such continuation is in accordance with the major street or road plan. (See illustration 3 in [this] appendix.) If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-of-way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary cul-de-sac, temporary T- or Y-shaped turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets as required in the following turnabout standards, with a notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abutting property owners whenever the street is continued. 
                  b.  Dead-end streets. Where a street does not extend beyond the boundary of the subdivision and its continuation is not required by the planning commission for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to such boundary than 50 feet. However, the planning commission may require the reservation of an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic, or utilities. A cul-de-sac turnabout shall be provided at the end of a dead-end street with a minimum right-of-way of at least 100 feet in diameter and a surface width diameter of 80 feet. 
                  5.6-4.  Intersections. Intersections of new streets in a subdivision shall comply with the following standards: 
                  a.  Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two streets at an angle of less than 60 degrees shall not be permitted. (See illustration 5 in [this] appendix.) An oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles for at least 100 feet therefrom. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point unless approved by the planning commission. 
                  b.  Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street shall coincide, wherever practicable, with any existing intersections on the opposite side of such street. Street jogs with center line offsets of less than 125 feet shall not be permitted. Where streets intersect arterial or collector routes, their alignment shall be continuous. 
                  c.  Minimum curve radius at the intersection of two local streets shall be 25 feet, and a minimum curve radius at an intersection involving a collector street shall be 30 feet. Alley intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular movement. 
                  d.  Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a two percent grade for a distance of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street. (See illustration 6 in [this] appendix.) 
                  5.6-5.  Additional width on existing streets. In subdivisions that adjoin existing streets, the subdivider shall dedicate additional right-of-way to meet the minimum street width requirements as follows: 
                  a.  The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the street. 
                  b.  When the subdivision is located on one side of an existing street, one-half of the required right-of-way measured from the center line of the existing roadway, shall be provided. 
                  5.6-6.  Street names. Streets or roads that are extensions of or obviously in alignment with existing named streets shall bear that name. The names of new streets and roads shall be subject to the approval of the planning commission and shall not duplicate or be similar in sound to existing names irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, circle, way, boulevard, drive, place, or court. 
                  5.6-7.  Railroads and limited-access highways. Railroad rights-of-way and limited-access highways, where so located as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands, shall be treated as follows: 
                  a.  In residential areas, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in depth in addition to the normally required depth of the lot may be required adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the plat: "This strip is reserved for screening; the placement of structures hereon is prohibited." 
                  b.  In commercial or industrial areas, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad or limited-access highway shall, wherever practical, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure suitable depth of commercial or industrial sites. 
                  c.  Streets parallel to a railroad or limited access highway, when intersecting a street which crosses the railroad at grade, shall, to the extent practical, be at a distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients. 
                  5.6-8.  Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the subdivider, as determined by the City of Ellijay, shall be constructed at the full expense of the subdivider without reimbursement from the city. The sharing of expenses for the construction of bridges not of primary benefit to the subdivider, as determined by the city council, may be fixed by special agreement between the city and the subdivider. The cost shall be charged to the subdivider prorated as to the percentage of his development so served. The engineering design of all bridges shall be reviewed and approved by the Georgia Department of Transportation. 
                  5.6-9.  Special-purpose streets. 
                  a.  Half-streets. Half-streets are prohibited. Whenever a street is planned adjacent to the proposed tract boundary, the entire street right-of-way shall be platted within the proposed subdivision. 
                  b.  Split-level streets. Streets, which are constructed so as to have two traffic ways, each at a different level within the same right-of-way, shall provide a minimum right-of-way of 25 feet per traffic way and such additional right-of-way as necessary to meet the requirements of [section] 5.6-5 and a minimum paved traffic surface of 15 feet. The slope between the two traffic ways would not be less than 2 to 1. 
                  c.  One-way streets. If permitted by the planning commission, one-way streets shall meet a minimum right-of-way of 25 feet and a pavement width of 15 feet. 
                  d.  Alleys. Alleys or service drives may be required at the rear of all lots used for multifamily, commercial, or industrial developments but shall not be provided in one- and two-family residential developments unless the alley or services drive is to provide secondary access to a lot (lots) whose natural grade is (are) more than 12 feet above the finished street grade, or unless the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of the need for an alley or service drive; pavement width is 15 feet with or without curbs; right-of-way, 20 feet. 
                  5.6-10.  Street construction specifications. All new streets constructed in the City of Ellijay shall conform to the following requirements: 

                   
                  5.6-11.  Street grading and surface specifications. Streets shall be graded and constructed according to design and materials specifications approved by the city council. 
                  5.6-12.  Drainage improvements. Water shall be diverted across streets by use of drainage pipe constructed of materials and of a size approved by the city. The pipe shall be a minimum of two feet below the road base. Backfill material shall be clean and solidly tamped about the pipe. The discharge end of the cross drain shall be stabilized using riprap rock for a distance of eight times the diameter of the pipe. 
                  5.6-13.  Stabilizing the right-of-way. The right-of-way shall be stabilized as specified in the approved soil and erosion control before final plat approval will be granted. 
                  5.6-14.  Signs. The developer shall install street name signs, traffic control signs and any other signs as specified by the city. 
                  Sec. 5.7. - Utilities. 
                  5.7-1.  Water supply and sanitary sewer. All land developments in the City of Ellijay shall connect to the public water supply. Where a public sewerage system is available, developments shall connect to such systems. Extensions shall be made at the developers expense. The water system and sanitary sewer design, materials and construction methods shall be approved by Ellijay/Gilmer County Water and Sewer Authority. In all cases where the developer intends to install an individual sewage disposal system, the developer shall present adequate justification as to why they shall not provide a connection to the existing public sanitary sewer system. The sewer system strategy shall be determined by the planning commission on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration the following factors: 
                  a.  Developer costs of installing individual water supply system and/or individual sewage disposal system relative to costs of connecting to existing public system; 
                  b.  The extent to which additional costs imposed upon the developer for a required connection to existing public system is necessary to promote the health, safety, or general welfare of the general public. 
                  If a public water supply system is to be provided to the area within a six-year period as indicated in the Ellijay/Gilmer County Water and Sewer Authority's Capital Improvements Plan, or other official document, the developer will be required to install a capped system, or dry lines, within the road right-of-way. 
                  When a water main is to be located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot before the street base is applied. 
                  5.7-2.  Natural gas. When natural gas lines are located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connector shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot prior to applying the street base. 
                  Sec. 5.8. - Surety in lieu of completion of improvements. 
                  5.8-1.  Purpose. In lieu of the completion of the required improvements necessary for final plat approval, the city council may accept security in an amount and form satisfactory to him, providing for the actual construction and installation of the improvements. 
                  5.8-2.  Form of security. The developer shall provide adequate and acceptable security from a bank or other reputable institution, which certifies the following: 
                  a.  That the creditor does guarantee funds in an amount equal to the cost, as estimated by the developer and approved by the city council, of completing all required improvements. 
                  b.  That, in the case of failure on the part of the developer to complete the specified improvements within the required time period, the creditor shall pay to the city immediately, and without further action, such funds as are necessary to finance the completion of those improvements up to the limit of credit stated in the letter. 
                  c.  That the security may not be withdrawn, or reduced in amount, until released by the city council. 
                  5.8-3.  Time limits. Prior to the granting of final plat approval, the developer and the city council shall agree upon a deadline for the completion of all required improvements. Such deadline shall not exceed one year from the date of final approval. 
                  5.8-4.  Release of security. When the improvements have been completed by the developer to the satisfaction of the county engineer, the city council shall release the security. 
                  Sec. 5.9. - Improvement maintenance security. 
                  5.9-1.  Maintenance required. The developer shall be required to maintain all public improvements in a development for a period of one year. The one-year maintenance period shall commence with the date of the city's acceptance of the deed or if secured by a surety for completion of improvements, as provided for in section 5.8-2, then the one-year period shall be measured from the date the security is released. 
                  5.9-2.  Maintenance security; form and amount. The developer shall post with the city council an acceptable form of security payable to the city in an amount equal to ten percent of the total cost of the public improvements. The purpose of the security is to insure faithful maintenance of said installations and improvements by the developer. 
                  5.9-3.  Call for security. If, upon being notified by the city council of failure of required installations or improvements, the subdivider does not correct the deficiency or commence work within ten days of notice, it shall be deemed to be a failure on the posted security, and the city council shall have the right to make the necessary repairs, either by public work or by private contract, and the surety, cash deposit and/or escrow account aforesaid shall be liable for the full amount of the cost of said repairs. The ten percent security does not indemnify the developer from those costs exceeding the ten percent security during the one-year maintenance period. 
                  5.9-4.  Release of security. At the end of the one-year period of time, the developer may formally petition the city council to accept dedication of the public improvements. If the condition of the improvements are acceptable to the city, at that time, dedication will be accepted and the maintenance security will be released.

                  e.  Ownership and management of open space. 
                  1.  Ownership of open space. A homeowners association representing residents of the conservation subdivision shall own the open space. Membership in the association shall be mandatory and automatic for all homeowners of the subdivision and their successors. The homeowners' association shall have lien authority to ensure the collection of dues from all members. The responsibility for maintaining the open space and any facilities located thereon shall be borne by the homeowners' association. 
                  2.  Management plan. Applicant shall submit a plan for management of open space and common facilities ("plan") that: 
                  (a)  Allocates responsibility and guidelines for the maintenance and operation of the open space and any facilities located thereon, including provisions for ongoing maintenance and for long-term capital improvements; 
                  (b)  Estimates the costs and staffing requirements needed for maintenance and operation of, and insurance for, the open space and outlines the means by which such funding will be obtained or provided;

                  (d)  Provides for enforcement of the plan. 
                  3.  In the event the party responsible for maintenance of the open space fails to maintain all or any portion in reasonable order and condition, City of Ellijay may assume responsibility for its maintenance and may enter the premises and take corrective action, including the provision of extended maintenance. The costs of such maintenance may be charged to the homeowners' association, or to the individual property owners that make up the Homeowners' association, and may include administrative costs and penalties. Such costs shall become a lien on all subdivision properties. 
                  f.  Legal instrument for permanent protection. 
                  1.  The open space shall be protected in perpetuity by a binding legal instrument that is recorded with the deed. The instrument shall be one of the following: 
                  (a)  A permanent conservation easement in favor of either: 
                  i.  A land trust or similar conservation-oriented nonprofit organization with legal authority to accept such easements. The organization shall be bona fide and in perpetual existence and the conveyance instruments shall contain an appropriate provision for retransfer in the event the organization becomes unable to carry out its functions; or 
                  ii.  A governmental entity with an interest in pursuing goals compatible with the purposes of this article. 
                  If the entity accepting the easement is not the City of Ellijay, then a third right of enforcement favoring the city shall be included in the easement. 
                  (b)  A permanent restrictive covenant for conservation purposes in favor of a governmental entity. 
                  (c)  An equivalent legal tool that provides permanent protection, if approved by the city. 
                  2.  The instrument for permanent protection shall include clear restrictions on the use of the open space. These restrictions shall include all restrictions contained in this article, as well as any further restrictions the applicant chooses to place on the use of the open space. 
                  g.  Tax assessment of open space. Once a legal instrument for permanent protection has been placed upon the open space, the Gilmer County Tax Assessor shall be requested to reassess the open space at a lower value to reflect its more limited use. If the open space is used purely for passive recreational purposes and the terms of the instrument for permanent protection effectively prohibit any type of significant economic activity, then the assessment shall be at the lowest possible value allowable by the tax assessor. 
                  h.  Significant structures. Structures of historic, architectural, or cultural significance existing prior to development of the subdivision may be retained within the open space, subject to approval indicating that these structures are compatible with any city land management regulations. 
                  i.  Road specification. Design standards for road construction in a conservation subdivision shall be consistent with those set forth in the City of Ellijay's Subdivision Regulations. 
                  j.  Road locations. 
                  1.  Roads should be located in a way that minimizes adverse impacts to primary and secondary conservation areas. 
                  2.  To the greatest extent practicable, wetland crossings and streets traversing existing slopes over 15 percent shall be strongly discouraged. 
                  k.  Locations of building sites. As long as the number of buildings meet the density neutral criterion set in section 6.2, it is intended that developers are given flexible on building locations based on environmental factors and the types of developments the market will bear. 
                  l.  Building locations considerations. The City of Ellijay's code enforcement officer shall evaluate the appropriateness of proposed building locations on conceptual preliminary plans or plats to determine whether the proposed locations satisfy the following considerations and evaluation criteria in Appendix A [below]. 
                  1.  Building sites should generally not be any closer than 100 feet from primary conservation areas. 
                  2.  Building sites can be located within 50 feet of secondary conversation areas in order to take advantage of views without negatively impacting primary conservation areas. 
                  3.  Building "footprint" locations may not be changed more than 50 feet from preliminary plat to final plat without the city's code enforcement officer's approval. 
                  APPENDIX A. EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR BUILDING SITE LOCATIONS 
                  In evaluating the layout of lots and open space, the following criteria will be considered by the City of Ellijay's code enforcement officer as indicating design appropriate to the site's natural, historic, and cultural features, and meeting the purposes of this article. Diversity and originality in lot layout shall be encouraged to achieve the best possible relationship between development and conservation areas. Accordingly, the city code enforcement officer shall evaluate proposals to determine whether the proposed conceptual preliminary plan: 
                  1.  Protects and preserves all floodplains, wetlands, and steep slopes from clearing, grading, filling, or construction (except as may be approved by the city for essential infrastructure or active or passive recreation amenities). 
                  2.  Preserves and maintain mature woodlands, existing fields, pastures, meadows, and orchards, and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between residential and agricultural uses. For example, locating house lots and driveways within wooded areas is generally recommended, with two exceptions. The first involves significant wildlife habitat or mature woodlands, which raise an equal or greater preservation concern, as described in #5 and #8 below. The second involves predominantly agricultural areas, where remnant trees groups provide the only natural areas for wildlife habitat. 
                  3.  If development must be located on open fields or pastures because of greater constraints in all other parts of the site, dwellings should be sited on the least prime agricultural soils, or in locations at the far edge of a field, as seen from existing public roads. Other considerations include whether the development will be visually buffered from existing public roads, such as by a planting screen consisting of a variety of indigenous native trees, shrubs and wildflowers (specifications for which should be based upon a close examination of the distribution and frequency of those species found in a typical nearby roadside verge or hedgerow). 
                  4.  Maintains or creates an upland buffer of natural native species vegetation of at least 100 feet in depth adjacent to wetlands and surface waters, including creeks, streams, springs, lakes and ponds. 
                  5.  Designs around existing hedgerows and tree lines between fields or meadows. Minimizes impacts on large woodlands (greater than five acres), especially those containing many mature trees or a significant wildlife habitat, or those not degraded by invasive vines. Also, woodlands of any size on highly erodible soils with slopes greater than ten percent should be avoided. However, woodlands in poor condition with limited management potential can provide suitable locations for residential development. When any woodland is developed, great care shall be taken to design all disturbed areas (for buildings, roads, yards, septic disposal fields, etc.) in locations where there are no large trees or obvious wildlife areas, to the fullest extent that is practicable. 
                  6.  Leaves scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted, particularly as seen from public roadways. (For example, in open agrarian landscapes, a deep "no-build, no-plant" buffer is recommended along the public roadway where those views or vistas are prominent or locally significant. In wooded areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature that should be maintained, a deep "no-build, no-cut" buffer should be respected, to preserve existing vegetation. 
                  7.  Avoids siting new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges, by taking advantage of lower topographic features. 
                  8.  Protects wildlife habitat areas of species listed as endangered, threatened, or of special concern by the US Environmental Protection Agency and/or by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. 
                  9.  Designs around and preserves sites of historic, archaeological or cultural value, and their environs, insofar as needed to safeguard the character of the feature, including stone walls, spring houses, barn foundations, cellar holes, earthworks, burial grounds, etc. 
                  10.  Protects rural roadside character and improves public safety and vehicular carrying capacity by avoiding development fronting onto existing public roads. Establishes buffer zones along the scenic corridor of rural roads with historic buildings, stone walls, hedgerows, etc. 
                  11.  Landscapes common areas (such as community greens), cul-de-sac islands, and both sides of new streets with native specie shade trees and flowering shrubs with high wildlife conservation value. 
                  12.  Provides active recreational areas in suitable locations offering convenient access by residents, and adequately screened from nearby house lots. 
                  13.  Includes a pedestrian circulation system designed to assure that pedestrians can walk safely and easily on the site, between properties and activities or special features within the neighborhood open space system. All roadside footpaths should connect with off-road trails, which in turn should link with potential open space on adjoining undeveloped parcels (or with existing open space on adjoining developed parcels, where applicable). 
                  14.  Provides open space that is reasonably contiguous, and whose configuration is in accordance with the guidelines contained in the Design and Management Handbook for Preservation Areas, produced by the Natural Lands Trust. For example, fragmentation of open space should be minimized so that these resource areas are not divided into numerous small parcels located in various parts of the development. To the greatest extent practicable, this land shall be designed as a single block with logical, straightforward boundaries. Long thin strips of conservation land shall be avoided, unless the conservation feature is linear or unless such configuration is necessary to connect with other streams or trails. The open space shall generally abut existing or potential open space land on adjacent parcels, and shall be designed as part of larger contiguous and integrated greenway systems.
