                  The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits." 
                  In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this County Code will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

                  (3)	With respect to violations of this Code that are not continuous with respect to time, each day the violation continues is a separate offense. 
                  (d)	The imposition of a penalty does not prevent revocation or suspension of a license, permit or franchise or other administrative sanctions. 
                  (e)	Violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time are a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief and by such other means as are provided by law. The imposition of a penalty does not prevent equitable relief.

                  A quorum must be present for conducting meetings of the board of commissioners. A quorum is a majority of all of the members of the board then in office. It is the duty of the chairman to enforce this rule. Any commissioner may raise a point of order directed to the chairman if he believes that a quorum is not present. If, during the course of a meeting, a commissioner leaves and a quorum no longer exists, the meeting cannot continue. If a quorum is not attained within 30 minutes, the meeting will be rescheduled by the chairman with the approval of the commissioners present.

                  (a)	Passage of a motion shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of commissioners present and voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present. 
                  (b)	Since the board of commissioners consists of only five members, the chairman shall be allowed to vote and a two-thirds vote shall be required for passage of all motions. If only a quorum is present, a unanimous vote is required for passage of motions.

                  (a)	The chairman of the board of commissioners, with the advice of the vice-chairman and commissioners, shall prepare an agenda of subjects to be acted on for each meeting. An agenda work session shall be held by the chairman of the board of commissioners to finalize the agenda. The chairman and all commissioners may participate in the work session. Whenever a quorum of the board of commissioners is present for an agenda work session, the meeting shall be open to the public and all notice and recordkeeping requirements applicable to an open meeting must be met. The agenda shall be made available to the commissioners at least one business day before every board meeting. 
                  (b)	Members of the public may request that a particular subject be placed on the agenda for the following meeting.

                  (c)	The order of the agenda may be changed during a meeting by a majority vote of the board of commissioners. A new subject that requires urgent attention may be added to the agenda during a meeting by a two-thirds vote of the board.

                  (a)	The clerk of the board of commissioners shall promptly record minutes of each board meeting. The minutes serve as the official written record of the board of commissioners meeting and shall be open for public inspection once approved as official by the board but in no case later than immediately following the next regular meeting of the board of commissioners. The minutes shall specify the names of commissioners present at the meeting, a description of each motion or other proposal made at the meeting, the commissioner who proposed each motion, the commissioner who seconded each motion, and a record of all votes. In the case of a roll call vote, the name of each commissioner voting for or against a proposal shall be recorded. It shall be presumed that a commissioner has voted in the affirmative unless the minutes show otherwise. More detailed information may be included in the minutes at the request of the board. 
                  (b)	The board of commissioners must approve the minutes before they can be considered as an official record of the board. A copy of the minutes from the previous meeting shall be distributed to the commissioners at least one business day before the following meeting. The minutes of the previous meeting shall be corrected and approved by the board of commissioners at the beginning of each meeting. A majority vote is required for approval. Conflicts regarding the content of the minutes shall be decided by majority vote.

                  Sec. 2-61. - Decorum. 
                  (a)	All commissioners must conduct themselves in a professional and respectful manner. All remarks should be directed to the chairman and not to individual commissioners, staff, or citizens in attendance. Personal remarks are inappropriate. A commissioner is not allowed to speak at a meeting until he has been recognized by the chairman. All comments made by a commissioner shall address the motion that is being discussed. 
                  (b)	The chairman shall enforce these rules of decorum. If a commissioner believes that a rule has been broken, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chairman can rule on the question or he can allow the board to debate the issue and decide the issue by majority vote.

                  Sec. 2-62. - Public participation. 
                  Public participation in meetings of the board of commissioners shall be permitted in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
                  (1)	Public comments. The final agenda item of the meeting shall be reserved for comments from the public. All members of the public who wish to address the board must submit their name and the topic of their comments to the chairman of the board at least three business days before the board meeting. These individuals will be allotted five minutes to make their comments and their comments must be limited to their chosen topic. These limits can be waived by a majority vote of the board of commissioners. 
                  (2)	Public participation on agenda items. By a majority vote, the board of commissioners may allow public comment on an agenda item at the time the item is being considered by the board. These comments must be limited to the subject that is being debated. Members of the public may speak for five minutes and may only speak once. These limits can be waived by a majority vote of the board. Anyone wishing to speak at any board meeting must be recognized by the chairman before addressing the board. 
                  (3)	Decorum. Members of the public shall not make inappropriate or offensive comments at a board meeting and are expected to comply with the rules of decorum that are established for commissioners. Individuals who violate any rules of the board of commissioners may be ruled out of order by the chairman or on a point of order made by a commissioner. A majority vote of the board will rule on the point of order. An individual who violates the rules of decorum may be removed from the meeting at the direction of the chairman. 
                  (4)	Public hearings. The board of commissioners may schedule public hearings for the purpose of soliciting public comment on any subject of interest to the board. Hearings may be held immediately prior to or following a meeting of the board or at such other places and times as the board may determine. No official action shall be taken at any such public hearing.

                  A regular meeting of the Board of Commissioners may be canceled, rescheduled or moved to a new location within the county site by the chairman for any reason. Other special meetings may be scheduled by the chairman or at the request of two commissioners. Whenever a rescheduled regular meeting or any other special meeting is to be held at a time or place other than the regularly scheduled time or place, written notice of the change shall be posted for at least 24 hours at the place of the regular meetings. In addition, written or oral notice shall be given by the clerk at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting to either the legal organ of the county or a newspaper having a general circulation at least equal to that of the legal organ and to each member of the county governing authority.

Where a meeting of the board of commissioners is devoted in part to matters within the authorized exceptions to public access requirements, any portion of the meeting not subject to any such exceptions shall be open to the public. No executive session shall be held except pursuant to a majority affirmative vote of the board taken in a public meeting. 
                  (b)	The minutes of the public meeting shall reflect the names of the board present, those voting for the executive session and the specific reasons for the executive session.

                  Rules of order of the board of commissioners may be suspended in the case of an emergency.

                  The chairman, with the concurrence of the board, may create committees of members of the board of commissioners to study any issue before the board. Any such committees may make recommendations to the board, but no committee shall be empowered to make any final decision on any matter before it for consideration. In addition to board members, committees may include other county officials, staff or citizens at large. Whenever a committee is created, its duties, any limitation on the scope of its duties, and the times, places and periods of time for which the committee may operate shall be determined by the chairman with the concurrence of the board. The chairman shall serve as on ex officio member of all committees.

                  Subdivision II. - Parliamentary Procedure 

                  Sec. 2-91. - Main motion. 
                  In order for the board of commissioners to take any official action on any subject, a commissioner must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the chairman until another commissioner agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the commissioner seconding the motion to support the motion. A commissioner may withdraw a main motion that he has made at any time before the board has voted on that motion. 
                  (Ord. No. 97-01, § 2-01, 2-10-1997)
                  Sec. 2-92. - Debate. 
                  (a)	After the main motion is recognized by the chairman, the board of commissioners shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the chairman in a manner that is fair to all members of the board of commissioners. Commissioners can participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the chairman. 
                  (b)	During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the board take a particular action on a motion (section 2-95). There are two classes of subsidiary motions: debatable subsidiary motions and undebatable subsidiary motions. Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee, and postpone to a time certain. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: limit debate, vote immediately, and lay on the table. They require a second and cannot be debated. 
                  (c)	Commissioners may also introduce privileged motions (section 2-96). Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on privileged motions. 
                  (Ord. No. 97-01, § 2-02, 2-10-1997)
                  Sec. 2-93. - Voting procedure. 
                  Voting on debatable motions and voting on undebatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)	Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways: (i) If debate has been completed and no other commissioner wishes to speak, the chairman can call for the vote. If there are no objections, then the chairman can proceed with the vote; (ii) If the chairman calls for the vote and there is an objection, a member of the board may move to vote immediately ("move the previous question"). If this motion is seconded and approved by a two-thirds vote, debate will stop. The chairman will then read the proposed motion to the board and ask for the votes of the commissioners. 
                  (2)	Undebatable motions. In the case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the chairman. The chairman shall read the proposed motion to the board and then call for the vote. 
                  (Ord. No. 97-01, § 2-03, 2-10-1997)
                  Sec. 2-94. - Ranking of motions. 
                  (a)	Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the board returns to consider the motion of lower precedence. 
                  (b)	A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and does take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section. Motions at the bottom of the following list take precedence over motions at the top of the list: 

                   
                  (Ord. No. 97-01, § 2-04, 2-10-1997)
                  Sec. 2-95. - Subsidiary motions. 
                  During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce motions that propose that the board of commissioners take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions and they allow the board to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions, amend, limit debate and vote immediately, can also apply to other subsidiary motions. 
                  (1)	Postpone indefinitely. If a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered by the board, that commissioner may move to postpone the consideration of the main motions indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled. A motion to postpone indefinitely can be debated but it cannot be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (2)	Amend. If a commissioner believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion. Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend. Motions to refer, amend, or postpone to a time certain and the motion to recess can also be amended. A motion cannot be amended more than two times. Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable. A majority vote is required for the board to adopt an amendment. If the amendment is adopted then the board shall consider the amended version of the motion. 
                  (3)	Refer to a committee (commit). If a commissioner believes that further information is needed before the board of commissioners can act on a main motion, he may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, then a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to refer should specify the date that the committee or department will report back to the board. This motion is debatable and amendable. A majority is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (4)	Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. It is debatable and can be amended. If this motion is passed, the chairman will bring the original motion back to the board for consideration at the specified time. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (5)	Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the commissioner who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion and a two-thirds vote is required. 
                  (6)	Vote immediately (previous question). If a commissioner believes that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the commissioner can move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable and a vote of two-thirds of the board of commissioners is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (7)	Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the meeting. The motion can be brought up for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the board during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion and the motion is not amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.

                  Sec. 2-96. - Privileged motions. 
                  Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting. They do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on these motions. 
                  (1)	Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the chairman concerning the rights of a commissioner or of the board as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The chairman is required to make a ruling on the question. 
                  (2)	Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on this motion but the motion can be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (3)	Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a commissioner must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion and as a result it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second, but is not debatable or amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.

                  Sec. 2-97. - Incidental motions. 
                  Incidental motions allow commissioners to exert their rights as a member of the board of commissioners. Incidental motions can be introduced at any time during a meeting. 
                  (1)	Appeal. If a commissioner disagrees with a decision that is made by the chairman, that commissioner may appeal the decision. if the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the board. The chairman has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The board may then debate the appeal. The board of commissioners shall decide by majority vote if the chairman's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is highest in precedence and can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (2)	Parliamentary inquiry. If a commissioner has a question about the rules of order, he may ask the chairman to give an opinion on that question. This question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the board of commissioners. This motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. This motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (3)	Point of order (question of order). If a commissioner believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chairman can make a ruling on the question or can allow the board to debate and then rule on the question by majority vote. A point of order can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (4)	Point of information (request for information). If a commissioner has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, he may ask a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the chairman and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required and the motion is not debatable or amendable.

                  Sec. 2-98. - Supplementary main motions. 
                  Three motions allow the board of commissioners to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the board. These motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the ways specified. 
                  (1)	Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the board to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at a meeting that is in progress. It allows the board to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any commissioner can make a motion to reconsider and any commissioner may second the motion. The motion is debatable but it cannot be amended. A majority vote of the board is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided and the board will return to debate and re-vote the original motion. 
                  (2)	Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the board overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any commissioner. It is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the commissioner seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting pursuant to section 2-58. The motion to rescind will then be placed on the agenda for the next meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will be formally made. If it is seconded, then the board shall debate and vote on rescission. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided. 
                  (3)	Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the board to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. This motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. It is a main motion but ranks higher than any debatable motion. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.

                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  County official or employee means all employees of the county, all elected officials of the county, the constitutional officers of the county and their employees, and all persons serving by appointment on any county board, commission, or department. 
                  Maliciously has the same meaning and definition that the courts utilize in construing that term as it appears in Ga. Const. art. I, § II, ¶ IX. 
                  Money damages means compensatory money damages (whether actual or special), but shall not include punitive, exemplary or vindictive damages. The county shall not indemnify any portion of a judgment that consists of punitive, exemplary or vindictive damages. The term "damages" shall also mean and include costs and attorneys' fees awarded to the plaintiff under any provision of state or federal law. 
                  Satisfying the judgment means the county has the right to pay the judgment or to settle or compromise the claim. The county may compromise the claim without the consent of the official or employee so long as the judgment entered against the official or employee is marked satisfied and fully discharged by the clerk of the court in which it is entered. 
                  Scope and course of the employee's job means any act or omission undertaken or committed by the official or employee while performing the duties or assignments of his county employment. A defense will be provided whenever it is alleged by the plaintiff that the incident giving rise to the lawsuit occurred at a time when the official or employee was performing the duties of his employment. However, indemnification will be provided only where the judgment itself finds and provides that the official or employee was in fact performing or attempting to perform the duties of his county employment at the time of the incident. Indemnification shall not be provided if the judgment finds and provides that the official or employee was acting for purely personal reasons outside the scope and course of his employment.

                  Subject to the definitions of the terms and phrases used in this division, whenever a county official or employee is sued for money damages based upon an act or omission that occurred within the scope and course of the employee's job, the county will provide legal representation at no cost to the employee. If a judgment for money damages is entered against the official or employee in his individual or personal capacity, the county shall indemnify the official or employee by satisfying the judgment, but only under the following conditions: 
                  (1)	Where the official or employee is adjudged to have negligently performed or failed to perform a ministerial act or duty within the scope and course of the employee's job; or 
                  (2)	Where the official or employee is adjudged to have abused his discretion in the performance of an official function within the scope and course of the employee's job, but only if the judgment provides the official or employee did not act maliciously.

This definition is not designed to be in conflict with O.C.G.A. § 3-1-2(13), and if there is any conflict therewith the definition contained in O.C.G.A. § 3-1-2(13) shall be the accepted definition.

If such owner or party in interest has no guardian or personal representative, service shall be perfected by serving the judge of the probate court of the county wherein such property is located at least 30 days prior to the date of the hearing which judge shall stand in the place of and protect the rights of such minor, estate, or incompetent person or appoint a guardian ad litem for such person. 
                  (f)	In the event of unknown persons or unborn remaindermen who are likely to have any rights in the property or interest or the proceeds thereof, the judge of the probate court of the county wherein such property or interest is located shall be personally served at least 30 days prior to the date of the hearing, and it shall be the duty of the judge of the probate court to stand in the place of and protect the rights of such unknown parties or unborn remaindermen.

                  Sec. 10-46. - Standards for determination of nuisances. 
                  (a)	A finding that any dwelling, building, structure or property is unfit for habitation or for commercial, industrial or business and not in compliance with fire, health, sanitation or life safety code, regulation or ordinance now or hereafter adopted by the governing authority of this county, is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes shall constitute prima facie evidence that a public nuisance exists. Any written citation served upon a property owner by the public officer or his designee charged with code enforcement shall specify the code section deemed to be violated and state sufficient details to apprise the property owner of the basis for citation. 
                  (b)	Public officers charged with code enforcement shall have the following powers and duties: 
                  (1)	To investigate the conditions existing on any private property within the county to determine which dwellings, buildings or structures are unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial or business use; provided, however, that no public officer shall enter into a secured structure without consent of the owner or tenant in possession unless he first obtains a warrant based upon probable cause. 
                  (2)	To delegate any of his functions and powers under this chapter to his employees as he deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter. 
                  (c)	In addition to specified code violations notices without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following conditions are subject to abatement: 
                  (1)	Defects increasing the hazards of fire, accidents or other calamities, including improper storage of materials on the premises; 
                  (2)	Lack of adequate ventilation, light or sanitary facilities;
                  (3)	Dilapidation and disrepair;
                  (4)	Sanitation and general uncleanliness, including improper keeping of pets and animals on the premises, and improper disposal of human and animal waste; 
                  (5)	Accumulations of trash, weeds (having a height of 12 inches or more), debris, junk, filth, standing or stagnant water, and other unsafe conditions; and 
                  (6)	Vacant, unsecured dwellings, buildings or structures in which drug crimes are being committed.

                  Sec. 10-47. - Procedure for hearings; findings by court; abatement. 
                  (a)	Whenever the public officer issues a citation to a property owner as provided in this chapter, and the property owner fails to respond by taking the necessary action to correct the condition within ten days of the service of citation, the public officer shall forthwith cause to be filed a complaint in the name of the county seeking to abate the condition on grounds it constitutes a public nuisance. The complaint shall state all charges giving rise to such action, including a reference to the specific code, regulation or ordinance deemed to be in violation, if any, and those facts known in support of the complaint. If the complaint is based upon the petition of five or more residents of the county, it shall identify the petitioners and the specific injury alleged. The complaint shall be served upon the responding parties in the manner set forth in section 10-42, and shall be accompanied by a notice of the date of hearing before the magistrate court, which date shall not be less than ten days nor more than 45 days after the date service is perfected. Continuances will only be granted for good cause shown. 
                  (b)	At the hearing, the burden shall be upon the county to prove its complaint by competent evidence. The responding party(s) shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by counsel, to present evidence and to cross examine the county's witnesses. 
                  (c)	If after hearing the magistrate determines that a public nuisance, as defined by this chapter and O.C.G.A. tit. 41, ch. 2 exists, he shall make his findings and conclusions of law and impose such order as required to assure its abatement; provided, however, the responding party shall be afforded a reasonable time in which to comply with the order of abatement. Costs may be imposed upon the respondent, which costs must be paid as a condition for the issuance of any permit or license necessary to abate the nuisance, in addition to regular permit fees. 
                  (d)	If the court determines that a dwelling, building or structure is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial or business use or is vacant, dilapidated and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes, he shall state his findings and conclusions in writing, and cause to be served upon the owner and parties in interest an order: 
                  (1)	If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling, building or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner or parties in interest, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter or improve such dwelling, building or structure so as to render it fit for human habitation or for current commercial, industrial or business use or to vacate, close and secure the dwelling, building or structure as a human habitation; or 
                  (2)	If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling, building or structure cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner or parties in interest, within the time specified in the order, to remove or demolish such dwelling, building or structure. 
                  In no event shall the court order the removal or demolition of any dwelling, building or structure except upon a finding, based upon competent evidence, that the cost of repair, alteration or improvement thereof exceeds one-half the value such dwelling, building or structure will have when repaired to satisfy the minimum requirements of law; provided, however, nothing contained herein shall prevent the governing authority from exercising the power of eminent domain for the taking of such dwelling, building or structure for public purposes. 
                  (e)	If the owner or parties in interest fail to comply with an order to vacate, close and secure a dwelling, building or structure within the time specified therein, the city manager may cause the dwelling, building or structure to be vacated, closed and secured and may post conspicuously thereon a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial or business use; the use or occupancy of this building for human habitation or for commercial, industrial or business use is strictly prohibited and unlawful." 
                  If the owner or parties in interest fail to comply with an order to remove and demolish a dwelling, building or structure within the time specified therein, the county administrator may cause the demolition thereof; provided, however, that such power may not be exercised until the governing body shall have by resolution directed the county administrator to proceed. 
                  (f)	The cost of bringing a complaint pursuant to this chapter, together with any costs reasonably incurred by the county in abatement of a public nuisance after determination thereof by the magistrate court, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. Such lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of an itemized statement of the total sum of the costs by the county administrator in the office of the county clerk on a lien docket maintained for such purposes. If a dwelling, building or structure is removed or demolished by the county, the county administrator shall sell in a commercially reasonable manner all salvageable materials therefrom and deduct the proceeds from the costs of demolition. Any surplus of proceeds over costs shall be paid to the owner and parties in interest. 
                  (g)	The county may enforce its lien in the following manner:
                  (1)	The owner or parties in interest shall be allowed to satisfy the amount due on such lien by paying to the city, within 30 days after the perfection of such lien, a sum of money equal to 25 percent of the total amount due and by further paying the remaining balance due on such lien, together with interest at the rate of seven percent per annum, in three equal annual installments, each of which shall become due and payable on the anniversary date of the initial payment; 
                  (2)	Should the property upon which such lien is perfected be sold, transferred or conveyed by the owner or parties in interest at any time prior to the termination of the three year period, then the entire balance due on such lien shall be due and payable to the county; and 
                  (3)	Should the amount due on such lien, or any portion thereof, not be paid as herein provided or be unpaid after the passage of the three year period, the county may enforce the collection of the full amount due in the same manner as provided in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-358 and other applicable tax statutes; provided, however, this procedure shall be subject to the right of redemption by any person having any right, title or interest in or lien upon the property, all as provided by O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4, art. 3. 
                  (h)	Nothing contained herein shall prevent or prohibit the magistrate court from punishing by its contempt powers any owner or parties in interest that willfully fail or refuse to comply with an order entered in accordance with this article.

                  (Ord. of 6-14-2004, § III)
                  Sec. 22-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
                  (a)	General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not excluded by this ordinance shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plants. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of section 22-34 (b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities, and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity. 
                  (b)	Minimum requirements/BMP'S. 
                  (1)	Best management practices as set forth in section 22-34 (b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)	A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of singlefamily homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)	Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)	The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (c)	The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following; 
                  (1)	Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)	Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
                  (3)	Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)	Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
                  (5)	The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)	Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
                  (7)	Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)	Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)	To the extent necessary, sediment in runnoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)	Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)	Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
                  (12)	Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or contructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)	Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culvert except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)	Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in 22-34 (b)(2) of this article; 
                  (15)	Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 5, art. 5, pt. 6, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted with a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  (i)	Stream crossings for water lines; or
                  (ii)	Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
                  (16)	There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 5, art. 2, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  (i)	Stream crossings for water lines; or
                  (ii)	Stream crossings for sewer lines.
                  (d)	Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 22-34 (b) and (c) of this article. 
                  (e)	The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 6-14-2004, § IV)
                  Sec. 22-35. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)	General.

They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the operator is the only party who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)	Application requirements. 
                  (1)	No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity with the jurisdictional boundaries of Berrien County without first obtaining a permit from Berrien County to perform such activity. 
                  (2)	The application for a permit shall be submitted to the Berrien County Board of Commissioners and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 22-35 (c) of this article. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of section 22-34 (b) and (c) of this article. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by four copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board. 
                  (3)	A fee, in the amount of $80.00 shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
                  (4)	In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 (9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (5)	Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and variances required by section 22-34 (c)(15) and (16) and bonding, if required as per section 22-35 (b)(5)b., have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. 
                  (6)	If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this ordinance section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (7)	The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this ordinance or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)	Plan requirements. 
                  (1)	Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 22-34 (b) and (c) of this article. Conformance with the minimum requirements may be attained through the use of design criteria in the current issue of the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the state soil and water conservation commission as a guide; or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws.

                  (4)	The permit may be suspended revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this ordinance. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 6-14-2004, § V)
                  Sec. 22-36. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)	The Berrien County Board of Commissioners will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate both primary and secondary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of the article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)	The Berrien County Board of Commissioners shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (c)	No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (d)	The districts or the commission or both shall periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 § (a). The districts or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion and sedimentation control program. The districts or the commission shall notify the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (e)	The board, on or before December 31, 2003, shall promulgate rules and regulations setting forth the requirements and standards for certification and the procedures for decertification of a local issuing authority. The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(c), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 30 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 30 days after notification by the division, the division may revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  (Ord. of 11-27-2000, § 1-2)
                  Sec. 22-142. - Groundwater recharge area district. 
                  (a)	Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
                  (b)	Purpose. The purpose of this district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures. 
                  (c)	District delineation. The groundwater recharge area protection map is delineated according to the state department of natural resources' (DNR) Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia, Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition), and the state department of natural resources' Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Standards for this district shall comply with DNR Rule 391-3-16-02, Criteria for the Protection of Groundwater Recharge Areas. 
                  (d)	Standards for permitted uses. The following are requirements for specific uses in the groundwater recharge area protection district: 
                  (1)	All aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks having a minimum volume of 660 gallons shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
                  (2)	New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within:
                  a.	A high pollution susceptibility area;
                  b.	A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15 acre-feet in size; and
                  c.	A low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet in size.
                  As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 × 10-7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the natural resources conservation service. 
                  (3)	New homes served by a septic tank/drainfield system shall be on lots having minimum size limitations as follows, based on application of table MT-1 of the state department of human resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management (referred to in this section as the DHR manual). The minimums set forth in table MT-1 of the DHR manual may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in sections A through F) of the DHR manual. 
                  a.	One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of table MT-1 of the DHR manual if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area. 
                  b.	One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of table MT-1 of the DHR manual if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area. 
                  c.	One hundred ten percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of table MT-1 of the DHR manual if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
                  (4)	New mobile (manufactured) home parks served by septic tank/drainfield systems shall have lots or spaces having minimum size limitations as follows, based on application of table MT-2 of the DHR manual. The minimums set forth in table MT-2 of the DHR manual may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in sections A through F) of the DHR manual. 
                  a.	One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of table MT-2 of the DHR manual if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area. 
                  b.	One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of table MT-2 of the DHR manual if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area. 
                  c.	One hundred ten percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of table MT-2 of the DHR manual if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
                  (5)	Lots of record approved prior to November 27, 2000 are hereby exempted from the requirements of subsections (d)(3) and (4) of this section. 
                  (6)	No construction may proceed on a building or mobile home to be served by a septic tank unless the county health department first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the state department of human resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management and subsections (d)(3) and (4) of this section. 
                  (7)	New facilities which handle hazardous materials, of the types listed in section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, excluding underground storage tanks, and in amounts of 10,000 pounds or more on any one day, shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements and any local fire prevention code requirements. 
                  (8)	Permanent stormwater infiltration basins shall not be constructed in areas having high pollution susceptibility. 
                  (9)	Any new wastewater treatment basin shall have an impermeable liner.

                  Sec. 22-143. - Alapaha River Corridor protection district. 
                  (a)	Description of district. 
                  (1)	The limits of the Alapaha River Corridor protection district are hereby defined to be all land, inclusive of islands, in areas of the Alapaha River and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. This area shall remain in an undisturbed vegetative buffer. The 100-foot buffer is measured from the uppermost part of the river bank, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the buffer area, the area between the top of the river bank and the water's edge shall be included in the district. 
                  (2)	Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. To address this potential, local staff will require that all applicants submit a site plan, prepared on a plat or survey, upon which the applicant or his design specialist has designated the river bank. Local planning/inspections staff will verify the river bank on-site, and ensure its proper delineation on the site plan. The required 100-foot buffer will be clearly delineated on the plat and enforced as a part of the local inspections process. 
                  (3)	The Alapaha River Corridor protection district is not intended to prescribe a specific land use, but rather to define a range of acceptable land uses. Within the range of uses which can be located within the district, this section establishes performance standards winch apply to development within the district. 
                  (b)	Intent. The intent of the regulations within this river corridor protection district is to limit the use of the Alapaha River Corridor, in conjunction with other governmental entities along the Alapaha River Corridor, in order to: 
                  (1)	Ensure that the section of the river in the county will not become polluted and unsuitable as a source for potable water. 
                  (2)	Protect the river corridor by establishing a natural vegetative buffer area bordering the river. 
                  (3)	Preserve those qualities that make the river corridor suitable as a habitat for wildlife.
                  (4)	Help control erosion and absorb floodwater.
                  (5)	Protect and safeguard the health and welfare of all the citizens of the county and adjacent counties by providing protection of the section of the river that is or may be used as a future source of drinking water. 
                  (c)	Conditions and performance standards. Within the river corridor protection district, the conditions and performance standards set forth in this section shall apply. 
                  (d)	Permitted uses.

                  b.	The dwelling shall be located on a tract of land containing at least two acres. For the purposes of these standards, the size of the tract of land shall not include any area that lies within the protected river (that is, for tracts of land that include portions of a protected river, the area between the river banks cannot be counted towards the two-acre minimum size). A minimum continuous lot width of at least 210 feet shall be required for each parcel or lot. 
                  c.	There shall be only one such dwelling on each two-acre or larger tract of land.
                  d.	A septic tank serving such a dwelling may be located within the buffer area.
                  e.	Septic tank drainfields shall not be located within the buffer area.
                  (2)	The construction of road and utility crossings shall meet all requirements of the Erosion and Sedimentation Control Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.) and of any applicable local ordinances on soil erosion and sedimentation control, as duly amended. 
                  (3)	Timber production and harvesting is permitted, subject to the following conditions:
                  a.	Forestry activity shall be consistent with best management practices established by the state forest commission; and 
                  b.	Forestry activity shall not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended. 
                  (4)	Wildlife and fisheries management activities are permitted consistent with the purposes of O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8. 
                  (5)	Wastewater treatment is permitted.
                  (6)	Recreational usage consistent either with the maintenance of a natural vegetative buffer or with river-dependent recreation is permitted. For example, a boat ramp would be consistent with this criterion. 
                  (7)	Natural water quality treatment or purification is permitted.
                  (8)	Agricultural production and management is permitted, subject to the following conditions:
                  a.	Agricultural activity shall be consistent with best management practices established by the state soil and water conservation commission;

                  Sec. 22-144. - Wetlands district. 
                  (a)	Findings of fact. 
                  (1)	The wetlands in the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation, water quality maintenance and pollution control: flood control, erosion control, natural resource education, scientific study, and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. 
                  (2)	Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  (b)	Purpose. The purpose of this section is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. 
                  (c)	District established. 
                  (1)	The wetlands protection district is hereby established, which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the county that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps. 
                  (2)	This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this section, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto. 
                  (3)	The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (d)	Permit required. No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the county. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the county manager and/or his designee using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued. 
                  (e)	Permitted uses. The following uses shall be allowed as of right within the wetlands protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided in this section. The activities listed in this section are exempted from Section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 permit. However, under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances. 
                  (1)	Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
                  (2)	Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
                  (3)	Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (4)	The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
                  (5)	The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
                  (6)	Education, scientific research, and nature trails.
                  (f)	Prohibited uses. The following uses are not permitted within the wetlands protection district: 
                  (1)	Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants.
                  (2)	Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills.

                  Sec. 22-172. - Policy and purpose. 
                  (a)	The State of Georgia is one of the leading states in wetland resources, more particularly South Georgia. The river corridors and riverine wetlands of the county and the state are indispensable for the maintenance of the county's and the state's water quality, protection, adequate water resources, and game and fish habitat. However, river corridors and riverine wetlands are fragile natural resources subject to flood, erosion, soil bearing capacity limitations, and other natural and human-induced hazards. In their natural state, they serve multiple functions for pollution control, aquifer recharge and discharge, storage and passage of floodwater, and erosion and sedimentation control, as well as wildlife (fish, waterfowl, bird and fur-bearer) habitat, education, scientific study, open space and recreation, and scenic and aesthetic beauty. Considerable acreage of these important natural resources has been lost, despoiled, or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, polluting, and other acts. Other river corridor and riverine wetland areas are in jeopardy of being lost, despoiled, or impaired by such acts. The continued loss of river corridors and riverine wetlands threatens water quality and the public welfare. 
                  (b)	It is the policy of the county to:
                  (1)	Establish a coordinated and cooperative program to protect, enhance, and restore river corridors and riverine wetlands, including, but not limited to, the following: 
                  a.	Establishment of a river corridor and riverine wetland protection policy for all public and private lands and waters throughout the county; 
                  b.	Formation of management guidelines for activities within the river corridor and riverine wetland areas; 
                  c.	Implementation of such a policy and guidelines through regulations and coordinated actions by the county and its local governments, including seeking cooperation from the state and federal governments and their agencies; and 
                  d.	Encouragement of government and private protection and restoration efforts for river corridors and riverine wetlands. 
                  (2)	Require that activities not requiring a river corridor or riverine wetland location be located at upland sites and that practicable alternatives to water-dependent activities be applied. 
                  (3)	Ensure the activities which do require a river corridor or riverine wetland location be restricted as follows: 
                  a.	Such activities shall not block flood flows or destroy flood storage, shall not increase erosion, shall not destroy natural erosion controls, and shall not unnecessarily destroy wetlands. 
                  b.	Such activities shall not cause or exacerbate water pollution by or through any of the following: 
                  1.	Direct or indirect discharge of pollutants or environmental contaminants;
                  2.	The location of domestic, commercial or industrial waste disposal systems on unsuitable soils; 
                  3.	Dredging;
                  4.	Unauthorized application of pesticides, herbicides, and algicides;
                  5.	Disposal of solid wastes at inappropriate sites;
                  6.	Creation of unstabilized fills; or
                  7.	The destruction of river corridor or riverine wetland vegetation which is important to erosion and pollution control. 
                  c.	Such activities shall not cause nuisances or threaten safety due to the location of structures in flood or erosion areas or on soils with inadequate structural bearing capacity. 
                  d.	Such activities shall not violate other local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations. 
                  (4)	Control activities in river corridors and riverine wetlands to protect and preserve their natural functions as listed in subsection (a) of this section. 
                  (c)	The activities which unavoidably require hydrologic or habitat modification of river corridor and riverine wetland areas provide for mitigation of, reservation of, or compensation of environmental quality and habitat losses. Such restitution to the county and its citizens shall include, but shall not be limited to, minimizing impacts through proper design and controls and restoration or replacement of damaged or destroyed resources.

                  (b)	Whenever the county determines that any person is in violation of any permit, regulation, standard, or requirement under this article, the county shall issue an order requiring such person to comply with such permit, regulation, standard, or requirement, including orders requiring restoration of preexisting conditions, and orders requiring restitution to the county by means that are deemed appropriate by the county. In addition, the county may bring a civil action for enforcement and may seek equitable and injunctive relief under this article. 
                  (c)	Any person who is determined to be in violation of any provision of this article by the county shall be liable for, and may be assessed by the county, a civil penalty of not less than $100.00 per day of violation and not more than $1,000.00 per day of violation. 
                  (d)	Any person violating any provision of this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished by imprisonment of not more than six months or by a fine of not more than $5,000.00, or both, for the first offense and by imprisonment of not more than one year or by a fine of not more than $10,000.00, or both, for each subsequent offense. 
                  (e)	In addition thereto and totally and separately distinct therefrom, any violation of any provisions of this article or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be grounds for immediate suspension or revocation of any and all permits.

The market value of the building should be (i) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (ii) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities, and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article.

                  Sec. 26-32. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)	The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
                  (b)	These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.

                  Sec. 26-33. - Purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)	Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwater or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwater.

                  Sec. 26-65. - Variances. 
                  (a)	The county planning commission as established by the county shall hear and decide request for appeals or variances from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)	The planning commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building inspector in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)	Any person aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission may appeal such decision to the superior court. 
                  (d)	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)	Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)	Variances shall not be issued with any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)	In reviewing such requests, the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this section and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)	Conditions for variances are as follows:
                  (1)	A variance shall be issued only when there is:
                  a.	A finding of good and sufficient cause;
                  b.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)	The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief, and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)	The county building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)	Upon consideration of the factors listed in subsection (h) of this section and the purposes of this article, the county planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Sec. 26-82. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data is available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwater shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 28-81(4), pertaining to elevated buildings. 
                  (2)	Nonresidential construction. New construction or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this subsection, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth in this subsection and in section 26-62(6). 
                  (3)	Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data is available: 
                  a.	All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved: (i) on individual lots or parcels, (ii) in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (iii) in expansions to existing manufactured home park or subdivisions, or (iv) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.	Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.	The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of not less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.	All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (see section 26-81(6)). 
                  d.	All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
                  1.	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  2.	Meet all the requirements of new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a through c of this section. 
                  (4)	Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 26-36 are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to high-velocity floodwater, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.	Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical date and certification thereof. 
                  b.	Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division.

                  Sec. 26-83. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations or floodways (A zones). 
                  Within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 26-36, where streams exist but no base flood data has been provided (A zones), or where base flood data has been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)	When base flood elevation data or floodway data has not been provided in accordance with section 26-36, then the county building inspector shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this division. Only if data is not available from these sources, then the subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply. 
                  (2)	No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)	In flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwater shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 26-81(4), pertaining to elevated buildings. 
                  (4)	The building inspector shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  (1)	All requests for roads to be named must be accompanied by a petition bearing the name and signature of each and every property owner whose property adjoins the road in question. Any request with a legitimate property owner dissenting will not be considered for automatic approval. 
                  (2)	Upon presentation of a petition containing all signatures of property owners, with no dissention, the Berrien County Commission will then make the final and binding decision to agree or deny to officially naming the road in question. This decision must be entered in the official minutes of the meeting to become law. Upon the adoption and signing of the minutes following a regularly scheduled meeting, the road naming shall be therefore legal, official, and binding.

                  (1)	Upon presentation of a petition to name a certain road, with any individuals opposing, the commissioners will postpone a decision until the next regularly scheduled meeting, and instruct the county clerk to cause a certified letter to be sent to the dissenting property owner or owners. This letter shall advise them of the request before the commission, and allow them the opportunity to appear before the commission at the next regularly scheduled meeting, to present their reasons for dissention. A copy of this article shall accompany the certified letter. Upon hearing both parties in the matter, the decision of the commission will be final. Failure of dissenting party to appear after being notified will be taken as approval of the decision to name the road as requested. A written response, however, may be considered if notarized affirmation of a hardship that would preclude the dissenting individual from appearing in person accompanies. 
                  (2)	After appearance of dissenting parties, or their appropriate letters of dissention explaining their reasons for dissention, the decision of the county commissioners will be final.

                  Sec. 54-51. - Generally. 
                  Subdivisions shall be reviewed and approved in the following stages as provided in this division: 
                  (1)	Preliminary plat.
                  (2)	Improvement plans.
                  (3)	Final plat.
                  (Ord. of 9-24-2001, art. IV)
                  Sec. 54-52. - Preliminary plat. 
                  (a)	Purpose. The purpose of the preliminary plat is to safeguard the subdivider from unnecessary loss of time and expense in preparation of a subdivision plat which does not conform with the specifications of this chapter. The preliminary plat requires only approximate accuracy of scale and dimension. Public agencies having jurisdiction will review preliminary plats regarding matters within their jurisdiction. During the review process, the subdivider or his agent may be called upon for consultation. 
                  (b)	Subdivisions not requiring new streets or water or sewer facilities. All subdivisions which do not involve the construction or opening of new streets or water or sewer facilities may be accepted by the county administrator in the form of a final plat, provided that essential data required by the reviewing agencies to ensure compliance with the intent of this chapter is submitted. The final plat shall be reviewed by the staff development review committee and planning commission before submittal to the board of commissioners. 
                  (c)	Filing. Any person desiring to subdivide land shall file with the county administrator five copies of the preliminary plat accompanied by a letter of application. The letter of application will describe the proposed subdivision at length and will also state for what purposes easements may be utilized, such as water, streets, power or phone maintenance. There will not be any restrictions on the use of easements. The letter of application shall contain the name and address of the developer and his agents, the zoning of the property to be subdivided, whether or not the subdivision will be developed in phases, plans for potential annexation, and plans for serving the proposed subdivision with sewer and water facilities. The plat shall be prepared in accordance with this chapter and with applicable county specifications by a registered land surveyor who is licensed under the laws of the state. The preliminary plat shall be deemed filed with the planning commission when it is filed with the county administrator. At the time of filing, a certificate of filing shall be provided to the subdivider and shall include the time and date of filing. The county administrator, working in conjunction with the subdivision development review committee, shall have authority to reject the preliminary plat if they find it does not comply with this chapter. If rejected, the county administrator and the subdivision development review committee shall provide the subdivider with a written statement specifying all the respects in which the plat fails to comply. Filing of the preliminary plat shall be accomplished at least 20 days prior to the regular planning commission meeting at which it is to be considered. The preliminary plat shall include: 
                  (1)	Title block and north arrow. The plat will show the name of the proposed subdivision, its location, the name, address and registration number of the surveyor preparing the plat and the date of the plat. A north arrow shall be included with a notation referencing the bearing to magnetic north, astronomical north or grid north. 
                  (2)	General layout. The plat shall show information as to the proposed street layout and widths, layout of lots with a notation as to the minimum size and width of lots, and any proposed open space. Any lands to be dedicated will be clearly identified. Plat scale, total acreage of the site and total number of lots created shall also be indicated. Lot and block identification and building setback lines shall also be indicated. 
                  (3)	Topography. The plat shall show existing contour lines dashed and any proposed contour lines solid, with both sets of lines to be at two-foot intervals, mean sea level (MSL). Prominent drainage features such as lakes, depressions, streams, etc., which could affect the design of the subdivision shall be shown. Engineering data showing the high-water elevation and how it was established shall be submitted with the plat. 
                  (4)	Existing features. The plat shall show the locations and names of existing and platted property lines, streets and their right-of-way, railroads and their right-of-way, public and private rights-of-way, sanitary sewers and size, water mains and size, bridges, culverts, storm drainage and size, easements, parks and other public open spaces, land lot and land district lines, and names of adjoining property owners or subdivisions. Groups of trees and swamp areas shall also be indicated. 
                  (5)	Location map. The plat shall include a small scale map of sufficient clarity so that the location of the proposed subdivision can be readily determined. 
                  (6)	Water and sewer facilities. A statement from the subdivider shall be submitted with the preliminary plat which will describe the method by which sanitary sewer and water facilities will be provided. If nonpublic sewer is proposed to serve a subdivision, then soils will be identified according to local detailed soil survey maps and soil percolation test results and a contour map shall accompany the preliminary plat at the time of submission. The contour map shall show the location and identification of each soil class and site of each percolation test. Percolation tests shall be made in accordance with county health department requirements. 
                  (7)	Future tract plan. In cases where a subdivision is to be developed in stages with additional plats being filed with the planning commission at a later date, the filing of the initial plat will be accompanied by a future tract plan, a reasonably accurate plat in sketch form of the entire tract which will show the future street system and topography for the entire tract. Once the required tract plan has been given approval by the planning commission, five copies of the approved future tract plan must be provided for distribution to the various reviewing agencies. 
                  (d)	Completeness. If any of the information required by subsection (c) of this section is omitted or misrepresented on the plat, the county administrator may refuse to review the plat and shall return the plat to the subdivider to be completed or revised. 
                  (e)	Approval by individual agencies. No preliminary plat shall be approved by the planning commission unless it is approved by the county engineer, the road superintendent, and the board of health. Such agencies shall, with or without modification, approve or disapprove the preliminary plat to the extent that each has jurisdiction. If the plat is rejected, the respective reviewing agency shall provide the planning commission with a written statement specifying all aspects where the plat fails to comply. 
                  (f)	Review and recommendation by staff development review committee. Upon receipt of the filing of the preliminary plat, the county administrator shall prepare those materials for presentation to the staff development review committee. The staff development review committee shall review the preliminary plat for technical compliance with this chapter, the comprehensive plan, and other county ordinances that might impact on the proposed land subdivision. The staff development review committee shall recommend in writing approval, conditional approval, postponement or disapproval within 45 working days of submission. 
                  (g)	Coordination. It shall be the responsibility of the county administrator to ensure that the review of the staff development review committee is brought together in a timely fashion for proper presentation to the planning commission. 
                  (h)	Review by planning commission. Final review of the proposed preliminary subdivision plat shall be made by the planning commission at its next regular meeting. The county administrator shall be responsible for coordination of information to be brought before the planning commission, which at a minimum shall include the recommendations of the staff development review committee (county engineer, road superintendent, and board of health). The planning commission may grant preliminary approval, conditional approval, postponement or disapproval within 30 days of submission. 
                  (1)	Preliminary approval. Preliminary approval by the planning commission means that the developer is now authorized to proceed with the preparation of the required improvement plans, outlined in detail under section 54-53. No developer shall proceed with any construction or any other work in the proposed subdivision before obtaining preliminary approval of these improvement plans in writing. Lots shall not be sold nor shall building construction begin at this time. Preliminary approval grants the developer a minimum time of 18 months within which he shall submit his improvements plan and final plat for approval unless a time extension is granted by the planning commission before the expiration of the 18-month period. If, in the opinion of the staff development review committee, substantial changes have been made to the approved preliminary plat, the revised plat shall be resubmitted as a new preliminary plat. 
                  (2)	Conditional approval. Conditional approval by the planning commission means the developer may proceed after written notice from the zoning administrator, as outlined under subsection (h)(1) of this section, but only after he has submitted at least five copies of the corrected preliminary plat to the county administrator, noting thereon the conditions or changes required by the approval of the planning commission. 
                  (3)	Postponement. Postponement by the planning commission means action is delayed for specific reasons which shall be noted and transmitted in writing to the developer by the administrator. Postponed preliminary plats may be reconsidered by the planning commission without resubmittal to the staff development review committee. 
                  (4)	Disapproval. Disapproval by the planning commission means denial of the application for the subdivision because the developer's plans are not in compliance with this chapter. For further consideration, the developer must rework and resubmit his plans as though they were a completely new preliminary plat. The specific reasons for disapproval shall be stated to allow for correction. 
                  (Ord. of 9-24-2001, § 4-1)
                  Sec. 54-53. - Improvement plans. 
                  (a)	General requirements. Subdivision plats receive their second official consideration as improvement plans. These improvement plans shall be approved by the county engineer and road superintendent, who shall certify that the improvement plans are in conformance with this chapter and official county specifications and with the requirements of the approved preliminary plan. No developer shall proceed with any construction work in the proposed subdivision before obtaining this approval. 
                  (b)	Use of professional engineer. Should certain design calculations be required to resolve flow problems, possible erosion or drainage problems, or other detailed engineering problems which might be encountered in the process of preparing the required improvement plan, the county engineer shall be authorized to require the developer to obtain the services of a professional engineer in the improvement plan design process. Should such services be required, such plans shall reflect his registration. 
                  (c)	Filing; review; approval or denial. To secure formal review of his improvement plans, the developer shall file with the county administrator three certified (signed and sealed by the developer's registered surveyor) white background prints of the improvement plans. The administrator will then distribute the improvements plan to the county engineer and road superintendent and the staff development review committee, who shall jointly review the proposed improvement plans, and the planning commission shall approve or deny the proposed improvement plans. The administrator shall notify the board of commissioners of the committee's action in writing. The review of the improvement plans shall include the review of plans for compliance with chapter 22, article II, pertaining to erosion and sedimentation control.

This responsibility is not intended to impede normal business communications and relationships, but is intended to alert employees to their obligation to use discretion to safeguard internal county affairs. Employees violating this policy will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination. 
                  COUNTY VEHICLE USE 
                  A.	It is the policy of the Berrien County board of commissioners to provide vehicles for business use, to allow employees to drive on county business, and to reimburse employees for the business use of personal vehicles according to the following guidelines: 
                  1.	Employees may not drive vehicles for county business without the prior approval of their supervisor. Before approving a driver, the supervisor must check the employee's driving record to verify the existence of a valid driver's license and to insure the employee is eligible for coverage under all applicable county insurance. 
                  2.	Employees holding positions designated as requiring regular driving for the county as a condition of employment must be able to meet the approved driver standards of this policy at all times. In addition, such employees must inform their supervisors of any changes that may affect their ability to meet the standards of this policy. For all other positions, driving is considered only a minor function of the position. 
                  3.	County vehicles will be assigned to those departments which have demonstrated a continuing need for them. Additional vehicles are maintained in a motor pool for use as needed. 
                  4.	Employees who need transportation in the course of their normal work may be assigned a county vehicle. All other employees requiring transportation for county business may use vehicles assigned to their department or those maintained in the county motor pool. As a last alternative, when no county vehicles are available, employees may use their own vehicles for county business purposes, but only with the prior approval of their supervisor/chairman/constitutional officer. 
                  5.	Employees who drive a vehicle on county business must, in addition to meeting the approval requirements above, must exercise due diligence to drive safely and to maintain the security of the vehicle and its contents. Drivers also must make sure that the vehicle meets any county or legal standards for insurance, maintenance, and drive ability. Employees are also responsible for any driving violations or fines as a result of their driving. 
                  6.	Employees are not permitted under any circumstance to operate a county vehicle or a personal vehicle for county business when any physical or mental impairment causes the employee to be unable to drive safely. This prohibition includes, but is no limited to, circumstances in which the employee is temporarily unable to operate a vehicle safely or legally due to illness, medication, or intoxication. 
                  7.	Employees may use county vehicles for non-county business purposes only with the prior approval of their supervisor or the chairman/constitutional officer. 
                  8.	Employees driving on county business may claim reimbursement for parking fees and tolls actually incurred. In addition, employees driving county vehicles may claim reimbursement for gasoline and other expenses directly related to county business. Employees using a county-supplied car phone must keep a log to substantiate its county business usage. All requests for reimbursement must be approved by the employees supervisor and the chairman/constitutional officer. 
                  9.	Employees who use their personal vehicle for approved county business will receive $.28 per mile reimbursement. This reimbursement is to compensate for the cost of gasoline, oil, maintenance, and insurance. 
                  10.	Employees must report any accident, theft, or damage involving a county vehicle or a personal vehicle used on county business to their supervisor and the chairman regardless of the extent of damage or lack of injuries. This report must be made as soon as possible but no later than 48 hours after the incident. Employees are expected to cooperate fully with authorities in the event of an accident. However, they should not make any statements other than in reply to questions of investigating officers. 
                  COVERAGE 
                  A.	This manual shall apply to all persons employed by the Berrien County commission.
                  DISABILITY LEAVE 
                  This policy outlines the conditions under which disability leave may be granted and the procedures for administering its use. 
                  A.	Voluntary reduction. 
                  1.	When an employee becomes physically or mentally unable to perform the duties of his/her position, but is still able to perform the duties of a vacant, lower level position, he/she may voluntarily request a reduction to the lower level position. 
                  2.	Such requests shall be in writing, stating the reason for the request and if approved by the chairman and the board of commissioners, attached to the appropriate personal leave form (see appendix). 
                  3.	If approved, the affected employee shall be compensated at the lower rate of pay.
                  B.	Personal leave. 
                  1.	A physically disabled employee may, in accordance with the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, request up to 12 weeks of personal leave without pay or benefits except medical insurance if he/she will be able to return to work in the same or a similar position. 
                  2.	Such requests shall be in writing with supporting evidence attached to the required personal leave form (see appendix) and approved by the chairman. 
                  C.	Disability leave may be granted when an employee is:
                  1.	Hospitalized or institutionalized, or in a period of convalescence following hospitalization or institutionalization as authorized by a licensed physician at a hospital or institution, or; 
                  2.	Is declared disabled or incapable of performing the standard duties of his/her position by a licensed physician. The chairman may request [that] an independent physician examine an employee who is unable or unwilling to certify his/her incapacity. The cost of this examination shall be paid by the county. 
                  3.	Disability leave may be granted for a period not to exceed 60 days and shall be renewable for one additional 60-day period upon the approval of the chairman accompanied by written supporting evidence of the employee's continued disability. All appointments made to a position vacated by disability leave will be on a temporary basis and such employee will be made fully aware in writing of the temporary nature of the position. 
                  D.	Reinstatement procedures. An employee who has not concluded the approved disability leave may, if a position is still available, be reinstated to his/her position within ten working days after making a written request for reinstatement to the chairman and successfully passing a medical examination certifying he/she is able to perform his/her normal duties for the position. Such examination shall be conducted by a licensed physician and paid for by the employee. 
                  E.	The county clerk shall send a written notice to the employee two weeks prior to the expiration date of his/her disability leave. Any employee who does not return from disability leave or formally resigns shall be separated by means of implementing the required personnel action form found in the appendix section of this manual. Said form shall be signed by the chairman/constitutional officer or department supervisor and forwarded to the county clerk's office for disposition. 
                  DISCIPLINARY ACTION 
                  The county believes in a fair, positive, and a firm approach to issues of discipline. Disciplinary action shall be applied promptly on the base of facts without favoritism or discrimination. 
                  Disciplinary action will be viewed as an attempt to change unacceptable work and/or personal behavior and to serve, motivate, and encourage the affected employee to become a more productive person. 
                  A.	Disciplinary action should include the following progressive steps depending upon the seriousness of the offenses: 
                  1.	Verbal warning. In the event of unsatisfactory employee conduct of a minor nature, the county administrator/constitutional officer or department supervisor shall inform the employee promptly and specifically of the undesirable conduct and shall give counsel and assistance in correcting that behavior. A written record showing the date, time, and reason for the verbal warning shall be completed by the person issuing the warning following the discussion with the employee. This shall be accomplished using the verbal warning form found in the appendix section of this manual. The employee shall be provided a copy and requested to sign the form as acknowledgment that he/she did receive a copy. If the employee refuses to sign the form, the issuing person shall note in writing on the bottom of the form the employee's refusal to sign the form. The original completed form shall be sent to the commissioner's office for placement in the employee's personnel file. 
                  2.	Written reprimand. In situations where a verbal warning has not resulted in the expected improvement or where more severe action is warranted, a written reprimand may be issued to the employee by the county administrator/constitutional officer or department supervisor. This shall be accomplished by using the written reprimand form found also in the appendix section of the manual. After discussing with the employee his or her unacceptable behavior or action, a copy of the written reprimand shall be provided to the employee and he/she shall be asked to sign the form acknowledging that he/she has received a copy of the form. If the employee refuses to sign said form, the issuing person shall note in writing at the bottom of the form the employee's refusal to sign the form. The original completed form shall be forwarded to the commissioner's office for placement in the employee's personnel file. 
                  3.	Suspension. In situations where verbal warnings and the required written reprimands have not resulted in improvement or where more severe action is warranted, a suspension without pay may be issued. The county administrator/constitutional officer or department supervisor who discovers a violation warranting a suspension, demotion, or dismissal shall immediately stop the infraction and submit a completed recommendation for disciplinary form found in the appendix section of this manual. The county administrator/constitutional officer or department supervisor shall take the appropriate disciplinary action and forward said original form to the commissioner's office to be placed in the employee's personnel file. 
                  4.	Demotion. In situations where verbal and written reprimands or suspensions have not resulted in the expected improvements or where more severe action is warranted, the employee may be demoted if a vacant position is available. A demotion is an involuntary reduction in the classification and job duties of the employee for just cause. A demotion may result in a reduction of pay. The county administrator/constitutional officer or department supervisor shall initiate the demotion in the same manner as provided for as a suspension. 
                  5.	Dismissal. In situations where verbal and written reprimands, suspensions and/or demotions have not resulted in the expected improvement or where more severe action is warranted because of the offense, the employee may be discharged. The county administrator/constitutional officer or department supervisor shall handle the dismissal process in the same manner as a suspension. 
                  B.	Notice and appeals: 
                  1.	The employee shall be provided a written disciplinary meeting notice (see appendix) anytime a disciplinary hearing is held which may result in a suspension, demotion or dismissal. This notice delineates the charges against the employee and informs the employee at least 72 hours in advance of the scheduled closed meeting with the county administrator/constitutional officer and/or appropriate department supervisor. 
                  2.	The employee shall be asked to sign the original notice as acknowledgment of having received a copy. The original shall be placed in the employee's personnel file in the commissioner's office. 
                  3.	Following the closed hearing, if disciplinary action is determined warranted, the employee shall be furnished written notice by the county administrator/constitutional officer outlining the reason(s) for the action and the effective date of suspension, demotion, or dismissal. A copy of said notice shall be placed in the employee's personnel file. 
                  4.	Suspensions of more than three days, an involuntary demotion, or dismissal may be appealed to the board of county commissioners who may uphold, reverse or modify the decision of the county administrator/constitutional officer or department supervisor. The board of county commissioners may, but shall not be required to, hold another hearing and receive additional evidence. 
                  5.	All county employees are responsible for knowing and understanding the rules and penalties to be applied for violations of any of these rules. 
                  C.	Rules of conduct. The following guidelines have been established to assist in the consistent administering of discipline and shall serve as examples and are not an inclusive list of the various types of violations and/or the discipline that will be applied for noncompliance to the personnel policies. These guidelines shall, not be deemed to preclude the right to discipline employees for other just cause. Using these examples only as guidelines, the county retains the right to address each offense upon its own merit, without creating any precedent for the treatment of any other offense which may arise in the future, and also retains the right to determine the degree of seriousness and the level of discipline to be issued.

In the event the employee does not have sufficient accumulative personal leave to cover the period of absence, the employee shall be personally liable for refunding the county all the amount received as injury leave pay. Holidays which occur during the injury leave days which subsequently were disallowed shall not be charged against the employee's personal leave accumulation. 
                  C.	It is the responsibility of the employee or his designated agent to make the required request using the standard "request of leave" form in the appendix of this manual to the appropriate supervisor and then to the county clerk for injury leave.

                  PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS 
                  A.	[Requirements and procedures.] This policy outlines the requirements and procedures for evaluating the job performance of all, nonelected county employees. 
                  B.	[Purpose.] The county's performance evaluation program is intended to be a system of communication among the board of county commissioners/constitutional officer/department supervisor and the employee. Positively and conscientiously applied, it can improve employee performance and morale by recognizing skills and strengths while constructively remedying short comings and weaknesses. It will also strengthen supervisory skills and identify areas in which training at either level would be beneficial. The ratings themselves will be useful in evaluation of potential candidates for promotion, in addition an intricate part of layoff procedures if such action becomes necessary. 
                  C.	Types of evaluation. 
                  1.	Employees serving initial or promotion probationary periods should receive at least two probationary evaluations during the course of such period. The first should be completed approximately halfway through the probationary period; the second no later than seven days prior to the completion of the probationary period. The appropriate supervisor may utilize fewer evaluations depending upon the applicant's prior qualifications and his/her length of probation. The first evaluation is intended to provide the employee timely information regarding the adequacy of his/her job performance. If the probationary performance is found to be unsatisfactory, the second evaluation should detail the reasons as specifically as possible. 
                  2.	Employees not in probationary periods shall receive at least one performance evaluation per year which is to be completed 30 days prior to any scheduled salary adjustments. 
                  3.	Employees may be given a special evaluation at the discretion of the chairman/constitutional officer or department supervisor. Such evaluations are to be used for internal department purposes (i.e., a supervisor leaving may want to evaluate his/her employees to assist an incoming supervisor, etc.). 
                  D.	Rating procedure. 
                  1.	Each county employee should be rated by the appropriate constitutional officer/department supervisor. Extreme care must be taken by each rater to insure fair and impartial ratings. Employees are to be rated on their performance over the entire rating period. The supervisor must discuss the rating with the employee, in addition to signing, and dating the form (see appendix of this manual). 
                  2.	If an employee has been assigned or transferred to another department, both immediate supervisors should cooperate in completing the form which will require the new rater's (supervisor's) signature. 
                  3.	The rater must discuss the evaluation with the employee in a private, unhurried, and uninterrupted session. The appropriate supervisor, may request the chairman to be present at the evaluation meeting. Areas of strength should be reviewed and highlighted as well as areas of weakness with employee. In addition, a constructive discussion on how to improve job performance should be included in the session. The employee should sign and date the evaluation form. If the employee refuses to sign the form, the rater should so indicate at the bottom of the signature page. The employee may comment in writing on any area(s) of disagreement with the ratings given. The employee's written comments will be attached to the evaluation form. Ratings shall not be changed once the employee has signed the form. 
                  4.	Finally, the form is reviewed by the appropriate appointing authority. The final probationary evaluation must indicate either the employee should be retained or removed. The originals of all forms will be forwarded to the county clerk's office for placement in the employee's personnel file. In all cases, a copy of the evaluation must be returned to the employee. 
                  E.	Employee appeals. 
                  1.	The rater must advise any employee who disagrees with the performance evaluation ratings of his/her right to appeal such ratings. 
                  2.	Such appeal will be reviewed internally by the chairman.
                  3.	The rater should impartially consider the employee's objections during the initial employee discussion. Unknown facts of problems that would warrant rating changes may be presented by the employee during the discussion. When a rating change is warranted, the rater may either complete a new performance evaluation form or cross out the old rating and mark the new one. 
                  4.	If not resolved, the appeal may be forwarded to the board of county commissioners; whenever applicable. 
                  PERSONAL LEAVE 
                  A.	The county awards personal leave to all full time county employees who have completed the 90-day probationary period. Personal leave includes what was formerly known as sick leave and vacation leave.

                  D.	Personal time cannot be used to compensate the employee for their 40-hour work week as to allow them to be compensated for overtime pay. 
                  E.	Personal leave may be used as the employee sees fit provided that leave is taken in accordance with the county's personnel policies and procedures. 
                  F.	The employee's paycheck stub will indicate the balance of hours accumulated in personal leave and this balance will be taken into consideration before requests for leave are a approved. 
                  G.	Personal leave shall not exceed a maximum accumulation bank of 600 hours. Any hours accumulated and not used or sold beyond this amount shall be forfeited. 
                  H.	A maximum of 40 hours shall be permitted to be sold back to the county during any county fiscal year. 
                  I.	Upon the retirement or separation of employment with the county, the employee shall be compensated the remaining balance in their accrued personal leave to be divided into 12 equal monthly installations until completely paid out.

                  SAFETY 
                  A.	Safety is a matter of great concern to Berrien County. The lack of proper safety procedures can result in lost hours of work with lost income to the employee and his/her family. More important, is the failure to use proper safety precautions may result in the injury or even death of the employee. Therefore, it is necessary for the county to establish specific safety rules and procedures for the protection of all county employees. 
                  B.	Safety rules are not established to restrict or punish employees, but are a necessary reminder and guidelines for employees to follow as they perform their duties for the county. 
                  C.	Often employees become so involved in getting the work accomplished, that they fail to use the necessary safety precautions. All of the safety rules, regulations, and equipment are of little value if employees fail to take a positive approach toward maintaining and improving safety. 
                  D.	The following safety rules have been established to initiate a positive attitude toward on-the-job safety and to inform the employee of the safety regulations which they are required to follow:

                  a.	When the employee is required to work in or adjacent to traffic in a public roadway;
                  b.	When the employee is working near or operating any equipment which is subject to discharge rocks and/or debris; 
                  c.	When the employee is working in any excavation or manhole;

                  5.	All employees shall wear appropriate eye protection such as safety glasses, goggles, or face shields whenever working with or near grinders, chippers, jackhammers or other similar equipment that presents an immediate danger to an employee's eyes.

                  8.	All open excavations or road hazards shall be properly covered, marked, and barricaded in order to prevent injury to the general public. 
                  9.	Employees shall not carry any firearms, explosives, or other illegal weapons while on duty excluding those required by the sheriff's department. 
                  10.	Employees shall not engage in any "horseplay" or other nonrelated activities which may cause injury to the employee or his/her fellow employees. 
                  11.	All excavations deeper than five feet shall be cut in such a manner or properly shored in order to prevent possible cave-in on employees while working. 
                  12.	Office machines shall be maintained with proper safety features.

                  2.	Safety problems or equipment defects affecting the operation shall be reported to the immediate supervisor. The employee shall complete the required "hazard" form (see appendix) then submit it to the appropriate supervisor for proper follow-up and replacement of equipment or corrective action. 
                  SOLICITATION/SELLING 
                  A.	Solicitations, distribution of literature, sales or collections of any nature on county property, during normal business hours by a county employee or another person by umbrella agencies shall be permitted contingent upon the approval of the chairman and the board of county commissioners. "Umbrella" agencies are defined as those groups whose sole purpose is the support of charitable, non-profit entities. 
                  B.	The chairman and board of county commissioners reserve the right to screen all requests and to make a determination as to whether an organization falls into an acceptable category. All other types of solicitation are strictly prohibited. 
                  C.	Any contributions made by employees of the county shall be made directly to the requesting organization and shall not be routed through the county's payroll system. 
                  SUPERVISION 
                  A.	It is the policy of the Berrien County that the work of all employees is to be assigned, directed, and reviewed by supervisory personnel. Employees ordinarily will have only one supervisor to whom they report. The chain of command shall be adhered to (i.e, supervisor, chairman/constitutional officer, etc.). 
                  B.	A primary role of each supervisor is to provide an effective link between management and non management employees. As such, supervisors are expected to communicate the goals and policies of management to the employees under them. At the same time, they are expected to communicate back to management the attitudes, suggestions, and complaints of their employees. 
                  C.	Supervisors must, in addition to mastering the technical skills needed for their department, be able to lead and motivate their employees to do their jobs effectively and efficiently. Therefore, supervisors should be prepared to: 
                  1.	Treat employees as individuals;
                  2.	Give recognition for good performance, and provide guidance when improvement is needed;
                  3.	Explain in advance when and why changes are necessary;
                  4.	Recommend employees with growth potential for promotion, even if it means losing them to other departments; 
                  5.	Show integrity by admitting mistakes instead of shifting the blame to others;

                  E.	Supervisors are expected to be involved, at a minimum, in:

                  7.	Controlling absenteeism and tardiness, and approving requests for time off;
                  8.	Verifying employee time sheets/cards and scheduling overtime when necessary;
                  9.	Recommending job elimination when appropriate;

                  11.	Maintaining neat and orderly work areas;

                  TELEPHONES 
                  A.	Telephones are provided for county business. Telephones will be answered promptly and in a courteous manner. 
                  B.	Use of county telephones for personal business is strictly prohibited except in the case of an emergency or with the specific approval of the employee's immediate supervisor or the chairman. 
                  C.	All toll calls for personal reasons made by a county employee on county phone shall be reimbursed to the county through a payroll deduction system.

                  TEMPORARY AND PART-TIME EMPLOYEES 
                  A.	It is the policy of Berrien County to supplement the regular work force with temporary, part-time, or intermittent employees, or other forms of flexible staffing, when needed because of periods of peak work load, employee absences, or other situations as may be determined by the board of county commissioners. 
                  B.	A temporary employee is an individual who is hired either part-time or full-time for a specified, limited period. A part-time employee is an individual who is hired for a normal workweek for an indefinite period, but who works less than 30 hours per week. An intermittent employee is an individual who is hired on a yearround basis and is subject to fill in occasionally for regular employees or during peak work load periods. Other flexible staffing classifications or arrangements may be added as needed.

                  D.	Regular full-time employees who are given temporary transfers are not considered temporary employees unless, in fact, their job has been eliminated and only temporary employment is available. 
                  E.	The county may utilize students (i.e., college intern, Job Corp, etc.) and other similar applicants for flexible staffing purposes, if not prohibited by law. When deemed necessary, such applicants will be required to provide a certificate of age. The county clerk will handle the assignment of students working special temporary or part-time jobs which are considered preparatory for management training programs. 
                  F.	Eligibility of temporary and part-time employees for paid absences, vacations, and holidays is governed by the individual policies contained in this manual. An employee whose status changes from full-time to part-time may use any days of paid absence or vacation earned as a full-time employee. An employee whose status changes from temporary or part-time to full-time will be considered as hired on the date of the change of status for purposes of eligibility for paid absences and vacation. Information concerning eligibility of temporary and part-time employees for other county benefits, is available in the county clerk's office.

Authorized overtime also should also be identified by the elected official or supervisor; 
                  6.	All absences should not be considered as hours worked for pay purposes. Elected officials and supervisors should inform employees if they will not be paid for certain hours of absence; and 
                  7.	The clocking out of another employee's time card or the falsifying of any time record is prohibited and shall be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

                  A.

When said training is extensive and completed at the expense of the county, the affected employee shall provide a written agreement to the county indicating the employee shall reimburse the county 100 percent of said cost if the employee resigns his/her position before completing one calendar year of employment after training has been completed. 
                  B.	The board of county commissioners will be responsible for determining when an agreement shall be required and the penalties which shall be enforced if the employee does not honor said agreement with the county. 
                  C.	Any employee who refuses to enter into an agreement as outlined in section A shall not be considered for the paid training by the county.

                  I. - Methodology 
                  The Position Classification/Compensation Plan 
                  The study of positions in Berrien County, Georgia was made at the request of county officials and conducted by the consulting county manager. The manager was instructed by the board of commissioners to study all positions in each county department. The following outlines the major steps undertaken to complete the work: 
                  1.	A meeting was held with department heads and elected officials participating in the study to outline the scope of the study and describe the type of assistance each department was to provide to allow for adequate data collection. Department heads and officials were informed of their responsibility to review the job description for each employee under his/her supervision and to return any comments to the consulting county manager. 
                  2.	All departmental supervisors in the county were distributed proposed compensation rate schedules by the county manager. The supervisors were requested to complete the forms (copies in the appendix section) without the advice of the consulting county manager. Department heads/elected officials were urged to ensure that each worker's job classification describes his/her duties and responsibilities as the worker. Finally, elected officials and department heads were cautioned not to allow themselves to treat lightly their responsibility in completing their recommended pay portion of the questionnaire. 
                  3.	The consulting county manager examined each completed form to determine the adequacy of the responses from the elected officials and/or supervisor. Based on information given on the form comparison data from other counties were prepared. 
                  4.	Once the analyses was completed and any additional and/or new information analyzed, similar positions of essentially similar duties and pay scales reviewed, responsibilities, desirable qualifications, and pay ranges were assigned to a single class. It is emphasized these "desirable" or "entry level" qualifications, describe skills, knowledge and abilities desired of the next person hired into the position. It is admitted the qualifications and pay range of any incumbent may be higher; but such is irrelevant to determining entry level requirements and assigned pay ranges. 
                  5.	Having made a tentative grouping of positions into classes, the next step was to prepare a class specification for each category of work similar enough to justify the same desirable qualifications and the same compensation. The class specification is a brief (one or two pages) description of the work that is characteristic of each class and identifies desirable entry level job information relevant to each class. 
                  6.	Upon completion of the classification phase, a pay grade system was developed for each department. Each position has been listed in alphabetical order. Also each employee's class title and the recommended pay scale has been included in the recommended section. 
                  7.	Upon completion of the class specifications, an alphabetical list of all classifications was prepared. 
                  8.	The proposed classification plan and pay scale system was then presented to the board of commissioners by the consulting county manager. The individual presentation was held to allow the board an opportunity to review the plans with the manager and discuss particular areas of interest and pinpoint specific classification changes or pay differentials. 
                  9.	Based on additional and/or new information obtained from the board's review, if justified, changes were made in the tentative plan and a final class pay plan developed and forwarded to each department for budget preparation purposes.

On a corner lot where the main entrance into a residence is facing a side yard, it shall be permissible for purposes of this ordinance to interpret the residence to be fronting on the street other than that street which said entrance faces, and side and rear yard requirements may be provided accordingly. If a building is constructed on a through lot having frontage on two or more roads not at an intersection, a setback from each road shall be provided equal to the front yard requirement for the district in which the lot is located. 
                  3-12 - Visibility at intersections. 
                  On corner lots within all land development districts, no fence, shrubbery or other obstruction to the traffic sight vision, except utility poles or light or sign standards, shall exceed a height of three feet within a triangular area formed by the intersection of the right-of-way lines of two streets or a street intersection with a railroad right-of-way line, and a diagonal line which intersects the right-of-way lines at two points, each 20 foot distance from the intersection of the right-of-way lines, or, in the case of a rounded corner, from the point of intersection of their tangents; provided, however, signs, lights or similar objects which are totally located at least 12 feet above the finished grade shall be permitted.

                  3-16 - Height limitations of walls and fences. 
                  Within any residential district, no wall or fence shall exceed eight feet in height within or along a boundary of a rear or side yard. Within the front yard, all fences shall have a height limit of four feet. 
                  3-17 - Required buffers in MHP, CA, RC, GB, WLI and HI districts.

Off-street parking associated with such uses shall be governed by this same provision. 
                  3-18 - Screening of service areas within 150 feet of public street. 
                  Any service area, loading area, refuse or storage area between a principal building and a public street being visible from said street and lying within 150 feet of said street shall be screened from view from the public street as specified in section 3-19. 
                  3-19 - Screening required. 
                  Wherever screening is required by this ordinance, a durable masonry wall, or fence and hedge of sufficient opacity to provide a visual blind, designed to be compatible with the character of adjoining properties, shall be provided and maintained by the owner and his successors and assigns. Such fences and walls shall be at least six feet in height, but no greater than eight feet in height, measured from the ground along the common lot line of the adjoining properties. Hedges or comparable natural plants shall be of such variety that an average height of at least six feet could be expected by normal growth within no later than three years from the time of planting. The owner/developer shall be responsible for annual maintenance of all vegetative screening and install the required screening prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. Occupancy will not be allowed until the screening is completed as a part of the normal developmental requirements.

                  3-22 - Permitted modification of setback requirement. 
                  When a building is proposed on a lot and when on either or both lots which adjoin such lot at the street right-of-way line there exists a principal building which does not conform to the setback requirements of this ordinance, the required setback for such building shall be as follows: 
                  (1)	Where only one said adjoining lot contains a principal building with a nonconforming setback the setback shall be the computed average of (a) the normal setback requirement with (b) the nonconforming setback; or 
                  (2)	Where both adjoining lots contain a principal building, each with a nonconforming setback, the minimum setback shall be the computed average of the two nonconforming setbacks. 
                  3-23 - Structures permitted above the height limit. 
                  The height limits of these regulations shall not apply to a church spire, belfry, cupola, dome or ornamental tower not intended for human occupancy, monument, water tower, observation tower, transmission tower, chimney, smokestack, conveyor, flagpole, radio, cell or television tower, mast or aerial, parapet wall not extending more than four feet above the roofline of the building, and necessary mechanical appurtenances.

                  3-25 - Modification of side yard requirements. 
                  When a lot of record has a width less than the frontage required in the district in which it is located, then the land development administrator shall be authorized to reduce the side yard requirements for such lot; provided, however, that there shall not be less than an eight foot side yard.

                  SECTION 10. - WATER RESOURCE DISTRICT 

                  10-1 - Purpose. 
                  The intent of this section is to establish minimum development standards and criteria which will afford reasonable protection of environmentally sensitive natural resources found throughout Berrien County and maintain the health, safety, general welfare and economic well-being of the public. 
                  10-2 - Establishment of water resource districts. 
                  The established boundaries of the county's water resource districts are shown on a map designated as the "Water Resource Districts" and are included as part of the Official Land Development Districts Map, Berrien County, which are on file with the county code enforcement officer's office. 
                  10-3 - Definitions. 
                  The following definitions shall apply to this section: 
                  Generalized wetlands map is the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps for Berrien County, Georgia. 
                  Hazardous waste. "Hazardous waste" means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste by the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the federal act, which is in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 CFR section 261.3. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland is an area adhering to the definition for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland determination is the delineation of jurisdictional wetlands boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC Subscript 1344, as amended. 
                  Natural vegetative buffer is a river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in the Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, "The Natural Environments of Georgia." [These are] habitats for endangered and threatened species that may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species. 
                  Pollution susceptibility is defined as the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. 
                  Pollution susceptibility map is a map of relative vulnerability to pollution, prepared by the department of natural resources using the DRASTIC methodology. (Georgia Department of Natural Resources Hydrologic Atlas 20: Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia.) 
                  Recharge area is defined as any portion of the earth's surface where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
                  Regulated activity is any activity which will result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S., excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  River/stream bank is the ground, bordering a river or a stream, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
                  Significant recharge areas are those areas mapped by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). 
                  Single-family dwelling is a dwelling structure that is designed for the use of one family. 
                  Utility is defined as public, private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems and railroads. 
                  Water resource districts. A water resource district is a mapped area which imposes a set of requirements and/or specific development standards or use restrictions. 
                  Wetlands are areas inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. 
                  10-4 - Groundwater recharge area district. 
                  10-4.1  Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics, thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
                  10-4.2  Purpose. The purpose of this district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures. 
                  10-4.3  District delineation. The groundwater recharge area protection map is delineated according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' "Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia, Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 Edition)" and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources "Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia, Hydrologic Atlas 20, 1992 edition." Standards for this district shall comply with the DNR rule 391-3-16-02, Criteria for the Protection of Groundwater Recharge Areas. 
                  10-4.4  Permitted uses. The following are requirements for specific uses in the groundwater recharge area protection district: 
                  A.	All aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110% of the volume of such tanks or 110% of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
                  B.	New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within:
                  1)	A high pollution susceptibility area;

                  H.	Permanent stormwater infiltration basins shall not be constructed in areas having high pollution susceptibility. 
                  I.	Any new wastewater treatment basin shall have an impermeable liner.
                  10-5 - Alapaha River Corridor Protection District. 
                  10-5.1  Description of district. The limits of the Alapaha River Corridor Protection District are hereby defined to be all land inclusive of islands in areas of the Alapaha River and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. This area shall remain in an undisturbed vegetative buffer. The 100-foot buffer is measured from the uppermost part of the river bank, usually marked by a break in slope. Because stream channels move due to natural processes, such as meandering, river bank erosion and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. To address this potential, local staff will require that all applicants submit a site plan, prepared on a plat or survey, upon which the applicant or his design specialist has designated the river bank. Local planning/inspections staff will verify the plan and enforce [the plan] as a part of the local inspections process. 
                  The Alapaha River Corridor Protection District is not intended to prescribe a specific land use, but rather, to define a range of acceptable land uses. Within the range of uses which can be located within the district, this section establishes performance standards which apply to development within the district. 
                  10-5.2  Intent. The intent of the regulations within this river corridor protection district is to limit the use of the Alapaha River corridor in order to: 
                  A.	Assure the section of the river in Berrien County will not become polluted and unsuitable as a source for potable water; 
                  B.	Protect the river corridor by establishing a natural vegetative buffer area bordering the river; 
                  C.	Preserve those qualities making the river corridor suitable as a habitat for wildlife; and 
                  D.	Help control erosion and to absorb floodwaters;
                  E.	Protect the section of the river that is or may be used as a future source of drinking water. 
                  10-5.3  Conditions and performance standards. Within the river corridor protection district, the following conditions and performance standards shall apply: 
                  10-5.4  Permitted uses.

                  10-6 - Wetlands district. 
                  10-6.1  Findings of fact. The wetlands in Berrien County, Georgia, are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  10-6.2  Purpose. The purpose of this ordinance is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. 
                  10-6.3  Establishment of the wetlands protection district. The wetlands protection district is hereby established, which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of Berrien County, Georgia, that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto. The generalized wetlands map does not represent the precise boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within Berrien County, Georgia, and shall not serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. This ordinance does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  10-6.4  Requirement for local permit. No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without a permit from Berrien County, Georgia. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, a wetlands delineation shall be determined by the land development administrator and/or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. If the [U.S. Army] Corps [of Engineers] determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit shall not be issued until the county receives an approved Section 404 permit from the U.S. [Army] Corps of Engineers. 
                  10-6.5  Permitted uses. The following uses shall be permitted within the wetlands protection district, contingent upon adherence to all federal and state laws, provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging, except as provided herein: 
                  A.	Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
                  B.	Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing in accordance with Georgia Department of Natural Resources' standards. 
                  C.	Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  D.	The cultivation of agricultural crops, subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. 
                  E.	The pasturing of livestock, subject to the Georgia Department of Agriculture's best management practices being followed. 
                  F.	Education, scientific research and nature trails.
                  10-6.6  Prohibited uses. The following uses are not permitted within the wetlands protection district: 
                  A.	Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants;
                  B.	Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills.
                  SECTION 11. - SIGNS 

                  11.1 - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this section is to provide for the use, location and size of signs throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, in an orderly manner that will promote traffic safety, provide for adequate identification of uses and minimize confusion, unsightliness and eliminate the excessive number of unnecessary signs of any size. 
                  11.1 [11.2] - Permitted signs in any district. 
                  [The following signs shall be permitted in any district:] 
                  a.	Signs incidental to any legal control process and necessary for the public health, safety and welfare. No fee shall be required. 
                  b.	One nonilluminated real estate sign, not [to] exceed four square feet in area, pertaining only to the sale, lease or rent of a particular building or piece of property. Such signs shall not be any closer than ten feet from any county or state right-of-way. Such sign shall also be removed within five days after the time the building is sold, leased, rented or if the real estate listing of the property is withdrawn. No fee shall be required. 
                  c.	Projects that are proposed to be developed in phases may be permitted one sign, not exceeding 40 square feet in area, and located no closer than 25 feet from any county or state right-of-way. See section 16 for the appropriate fee schedule. 
                  d.	The code enforcement officer may permit the placement of two temporary signs, not exceeding 20 square feet, for a period not to exceed 30 days, announcing a special event. Said signs shall not be located any closer than 25 feet on any county or state right-of-way.

                  (4)	To have and exercise usual powers of private corporation except such as are inconsistent with this division, including the power to appoint and hire officers, agents and employees and to provide their compensation and duties, which officers and agents may or may not be members of the authority, and the power to adopt and amend a corporate seal and bylaws and regulations for the conduct and management of the authority; 
                  (5)	To encourage and promote the expansion and development of industrial and commercial facilities in Berrien County so as to relieve insofar as possible unemployment within its boundaries, and to that end to acquire by purchase or gift any building or structure within the limits of Berrien County, suitable for and intended for use as a factory, mill, shop, processing plant, assembly plant, or fabricating plant, including all necessary and appurtenant lands and appurtenances thereto, and all necessary or useful furnishings machinery and equipment. Such acquisition may be through the acquisition of land and the construction thereon of a building, including the demolition of existing structures, or through the acquisition of an existing building and the remodeling, renovating, reconstruction, furnishing and equipping of such building; 
                  (6)	No building acquired hereunder shall be operated by the authority but shall be leased or sold to one or more persons, firms or corporations. If sold, the purchase price may be paid at one time or in installments falling due in not more than 30 years from the date of transfer of possession. The lessee or purchaser shall be required to pay all costs of operating and maintaining the building or buildings and to pay rentals or installments sufficient, together with other revenues which may be pledged for the purpose, to retire all bonds, both principal and interest, and to pay all other expenses which the authority may have incurred in connection with the undertaking; 
                  (7)	To accumulate its funds from year to year and to invest accumulated funds in any manner that public funds of the State of Georgia or any of its political subdivisions may be invested;

                  (e)	The authority shall not be authorized to create in any manner any debt, liability or obligation against the State of Georgia or Berrien County. 
                  (f)	The members of the authority shall receive no compensation for their services to the authority. 
                  (g)	In order to finance any undertaking within the scope of its power or to refund any bonds then outstanding, the authority is hereby authorized to issue bonds bearing rate or rates of interest and maturing at the years and amounts determined by the authority and the procedure of validation, issuance and delivery shall be in all respects in accordance with the Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A. § 36-82-60 et seq.), as if said obligations had been originally authorized to be issued thereunder; provided, however, that any property, real or personal, of the authority may be pledged, mortgaged, conveyed, assigned, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered as security for any lawful debt of the authority. The authority may execute any trust agreement or indenture not in conflict with the provisions of this division to provide security for any bonds issued as provided herein, and such trust agreement or indenture may provide for foreclosure or forced sale of any property of the authority upon default on such bonds either in payment of principal or interest or under any term or condition under which such bonds are issued. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to create a right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of Berrien County to pay any such bonds or the interest thereon nor to enforce payment thereof against any property of Berrien County. 
                  (h)	The authority may authorize additional bonds, for extensions and permanent improvements to any industrial building acquired hereunder, to be placed in escrow and to be negotiated from time to time as proceeds for that purpose may become necessary.

                  (i)	No bonds except refunding bonds shall be issued hereunder unless the authority shall have found and declared that: 
                  (1)	The undertaking for which the bonds are to be issued will increase employment in Berrien County. 
                  (2)	The lessee or purchaser of the building or buildings involved will not by virtue of establishing operations in said county, reduce the number of employees employed by said lessee or purchaser elsewhere in the State of Georgia. 
                  (j)	No moneys derived by the authority from any source other than gifts and contributions from private individuals, firms or corporations shall at any time be used for entertainment, or other promotional expenses. 
                  (k)	Should said authority for any reason be dissolved, title to all property of every kind and nature, real and personal, held by the authority at the time of such dissolution shall revert to Berrien County subject to any mortgages, liens, leases or other encumbrances outstanding against or in respect to said property at that time. 
                  (l)	This division is adopted for the purpose of promoting and expanding for the public good and welfare industry and trade within Berrien County and reducing unemployment to the greatest extent possible, and this division and any law enacted with reference to the authority shall be liberally construed for the accomplishment of these purposes. 
                  (m)	The amendment codified in this division shall be effective immediately upon proclamation of its ratification by the governor and the first members of the authority shall be appointed within 30 days after such proclamation. 
                  (n)	The general assembly may by law further define and prescribe the powers and duties of the authority and the exercise thereof, and may enlarge and restrict the same, and may likewise further regulate the management and conduct of the authority. The authority shall be an instrumentality of the authority [sic].
