PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Montezuma, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1990 Code, as supplemented through April 9, 2007, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1990 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Code Attorney, and Lisa Stevens, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Joyce Hardy, City Clerk, and Jon Coogle, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

State law references in footnote form have been editorially supplied and guide the user to relevant statute and constitutional provisions that may, in some instances, supersede the Charter.

                  Editor's note— O.C.G.A. § 15-10-154 authorizes municipalities to impose, through their charters and ordinances, penalties not to exceed a fine of $1,000.00 and imprisonment of not more than six months. Section 1-8 of the city's code of ordinances authorizes those maximum penalties. Section 3.04 of this Charter vests the municipal court with authority to impose maximum penalties.

                  Section 5.05. - Effective date. 
                  Be it further enacted, that this Act shall be effective on and after the first day of April, 1963.

                  (2)	Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles;

                  (d)	All sections, articles, chapters or provisions desired to be repealed shall be specifically repealed by section, article or chapter number in the following language: "Section (chapter or article) ____________ of The Code of Montezuma, Georgia, is repealed."

                  (c)	Except as otherwise provided specifically in this Code or by general law, a person convicted of a violation of this Code shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00, labor upon the streets or public works in the city for a term not exceeding 30 days, or confinement for a term not exceeding six months, or any combination thereof. With respect to violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time, each day the violation continues is a separate offense. 
                  (d)	The imposition of a penalty does not prevent revocation or suspension of a license, permit or franchise. 
                  (e)	Violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of a penalty does not prevent equitable relief.

Each such request shall set forth the issue or issues to be discussed, the date that the person proposes to appear before the city council, and include documentation if any. No person shall be denied the right to speak due to the nature of an issue to be discussed so long as the issue relates to the city's business or a matter over which the council has control and is not repetitive. Priority for speaking will be given in the order that completed written requests are received. 
                  (d)	Repetitive, irrelevant or abusive remarks from the public, or matters not concerning the city's business or any matter over which the council has no control, may be closed off at any time by the presiding officer or by the majority vote of the council members present.

                  (h)	The presiding officer at each meeting of the city council shall have the responsibility to rule out of order any person violating these rules and may direct such individual to conduct themselves in a manner that complies with these rules of conduct. Any failure to abide by the order of the presiding officer may result in forfeiture of the remaining time allocated for the address, or in extreme cases, removal from the council chambers. Additionally, any council member may request a ruling on whether any individual appearing before the council is out of order and the council may, by majority vote, direct that an individual who is out of order be ordered to cease his presentation and be seated or be ejected from the council chambers. Robert's Rules of Order will be followed in the conduct of city meetings. 
                  (i)	No issue brought up in an address to the council under this section shall be acted upon by the council during the portion of the meeting set aside for public addresses to the council unless the issue is clearly stated on the agenda. 
                  (j)	To avoid the perception that a statement is true because there is not an immediate response, the presiding officer shall emphasize in an appropriate manner that city procedure is for staff to respond, when warranted, to comments directly to the person speaking at a later date after staff has had an opportunity to review the matter commented upon. 
                  (k)	Each person appearing before the city council shall be provided with a copy of the section prior to their appearance. As a condition to making an address to the council, each person shall acknowledge receipt of a copy of this section in writing.

               <head>Chapter 6 - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS </head>
               <p>                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 6-1. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this chapter is to regulate certain types of businesses, including but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this chapter represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

                  (3)	Enforcement of liens; penalties.

                  (c)	Personal liability for failure to withhold; enforcement.

                  Sec. 38-20. - Exemptions. 
                  This chapter shall apply to any land disturbing activity undertaken by any person on any land except for the following: 
                  (1)	Surface mining, as same is defined in O.C.G.A. § 12-4-72: 
                  a.	Granite quarrying and land clearing for such quarrying; 
                  b.	Such minor land disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion; 
                  c.	The construction of single-family residences, when such are constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, or the construction of single-family residences not a part of a platted subdivision, a planned community, or an association of other residential lots consisting of more than two lots and not otherwise exempted under this subsection; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in section 38-21. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this subsection, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5, of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.). In any such buffer zone, no land disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other waters flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of section 38-21 and the buffer zones provided by this section shall be enforced by the issuing authority; 
                  d.

                  Sec. 38-21. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
                  (a)	Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not excluded by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity. 
                  (b)	Minimum requirements/BMP's. 
                  (1)	Best management practices as set forth in this subsection and subsection (c) of this section shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practice shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f). As used in this subsection (b), the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed to control soil erosion and sedimentation for all events up to and including a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event. 
                  (2)	A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-3-30(f) for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving water being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warmwater fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. 
                  (3)	Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)	The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (c)	The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter, published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)	Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)	Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)	Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)	Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)	The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)	Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)	Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)	Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)	To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements; 
                  (10)	Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills; 
                  (11)	Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)	Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)	Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)	Land disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 38-21(b)(2); 
                  (15)	Land disturbing activities shall not be conducted within 25 feet of the banks of any state waters, as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented; provided, however, that buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection; and 
                  (16)	Land disturbing activities shall not be conducted within 100 horizontal feet, as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, of the banks of any state waters classified as a trout stream pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.), unless a variance for such activity is granted by the director, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. 
                  (d)	Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent an issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)	The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Code 1990, § 19-4) 
                  Sec. 38-22. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)	General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of the issuing authority that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning provisions, stormwater management provisions, subdivision provisions, flood damage prevention provisions, this chapter, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the issuing authority. However, the property owner is the only party that can obtain a permit. 
                  (b)	Application requirements. 
                  (1)	Permit to precede activity. No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city, without first obtaining a permit from the building inspections department to perform such activity. 
                  (2)	Submission requirements. The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city engineer and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of section 38-21(b) and (c). 
                  (3)	Fee. A land development permit fee, in the amount established by resolution of the city council shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area not to exceed the maximum fee established by the city council. 
                  (4)	Application review. Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for permit, the issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 38-21(c)(15) and (16) and bonding, if required as per section 38-22(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. 
                  (5)	Denial. If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)	Bond. The issuing authority may require the permit application to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this chapter or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)	Plan requirements. 
                  (1)	Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 38-21(b) and (c). Conformance with the minimum requirements may be attained through the use of design criteria in the current issue of the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the state soil and water conservation commission as a guide; or through the use of alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The plan for the land disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. 
                  (2)	Data required for site plan.

                  (a)	Failure to obtain a permit for land disturbing activity. If any person commences any land disturbing activity requiring a land disturbing permit as prescribed in this chapter without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the issuing authority. 
                  (b)	Stop work orders. Upon notice from the issuing authority or its agent, work done on any project that is being done contrary to the provisions of this chapter or in a dangerous or unsafe manner shall be immediately stopped. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, his authorized agent or the person in charge of the activity on the property, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency exists, no written notice shall be required. 
                  (c)	Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 38-22(b)(6). The issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)	Monetary penalties. Any person violating any provisions of this chapter, permitting conditions, or stop work order shall be liable for a monetary penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day, by a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding 60 days in jail, or both fine plus jail or work alternative. Each day during which the violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall constitute a separate violation.

                  ARTICLE III. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREAS 

                  Sec. 38-56. - Findings and objectives. 
                  (a)	Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and to promote a healthy economic climate in the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that public drinking water resources of high quality be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources the city and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas to ensure that pollution threats to water resources are minimized. 
                  (b)	Objectives. The objectives of this article are: 
                  (1)	Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use, or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
                  (2)	Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and 
                  (3)	Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.

                  Sec. 38-57. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
                  Groundwater recharge area (synonymous with aquifer recharge area) means an area of the earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer. 
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities. 
                  Pollution susceptibility maps mean maps prepared by the state department of natural resources (DNR) that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
                  Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by the DNR in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces.

                  ARTICLE IV. - RIVER CORRIDOR PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 38-89. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)	The state has determined river corridors are of vital importance to the quality of life in the state in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors are fragile natural resources subject to flood, erosion, soil-bearing capacity limitation, and other natural and human-induced hazards. In their natural state they serve multiple functions, including pollution control, aquifer recharge and discharge, storage and passage of floodwater, erosion and sedimentation control, as well as wildlife habitat, education, scientific study, open space and recreation, and scenic and aesthetic beauty. 
                  (b)	The state's Comprehensive Planning Act of 1989 provided for coordinated and comprehensive planning by municipal and county governments, including consideration for the natural resources, environments, and vital areas within their jurisdictions. The O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 authorized the department of natural resources to develop minimum planning standards and procedures for the protection of river corridors in the state, and requires local governments to use these minimum standards in developing and implementing local comprehensive plans. The method mandated in O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 for protecting river corridors is establishment of a natural vegetative buffer bordering each protected river. In 1993, the city developed a River Corridor Protection Plan, as authorized in O.C.G.A. § 36-70-3, to maintain the integrity of the Flint River. 
                  (c)	The purposes of this article are to provide for protection of the river corridor by regulating activities in or adjacent to the corridor; provide for the powers and duties of the city; provide goals, guidelines, practices, procedures, policies, rules, and regulations; provide minimum standards for regulated activities within the river corridor; provide for a review of decision; provide for hearings and judicial review; provide for enforcement; prohibit certain activities or actions; provide for civil and other penalties; repeal conflicting ordinances; and other purposes.

                  Buffer or buffer area. See River corridor . 
                  Comprehensive plan means the City of Montezuma Comprehensive Plan, and as may be amended. 
                  Contaminant means any regulated substance, as defined by the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as in effect on the date of passage of this article and as amended from time to time, and all petroleum products, including gasoline, oil, waste oils, and other fuels as well as their hazardous constituents. 
                  Hazardous material means any "contaminant" as defined in this article, and any hazardous chemical for which a material safety data sheet must be filed according to 42 USC 11021 and 11022. 
                  Hazardous waste means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environment Protection Agency according to federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 CFR 261.3. 
                  Land disturbing activity means any grading, scraping, excavating, or filling of land, clearing of vegetation, and any construction, rebuilding, or alteration of a structure. Land disturbing activity shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, individual home gardens, yard and grounds upkeep, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single-family dwelling, or the cutting of firewood for personal use. 
                  Natural vegetative buffer or buffer area means a river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, The Natural Environments of Georgia. Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species. 
                  Perennial river means a river or section of a river that flows continuously throughout the year. 
                  Person means any individual, group of individuals, association, firm, partnership, corporation, trust, estate, organization, or legal entity of any kind, including municipal corporations, government agencies, or subdivisions thereof. 
                  Protected river means any perennial river or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second as determined by appropriate U.S. Geological Survey documents. By this definition, the Flint River in the city is a protected river. 
                  Public utility or utilities means a service or services provided by a public utility company or a private entity and including all equipment and structures necessary to provide such services. 
                  River bank means the rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
                  River corridor means all land, including islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq., or the Coastal Marshland Protection Act, O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-280 through 12-5-293, in areas of a protected river and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. The 100-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the river bank, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured 100-foot-wide buffer; the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river water shall be treated in the same manner as the river corridor. Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purpose of this article, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for the local comprehensive plan as established by the department of community affairs. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the start of the review period will require a revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next review by the department of community affairs.

                  ARTICLE V. - WETLAND PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 38-127. - Findings and purpose. 
                  (a)	Findings of fact. Wetlands are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. Nationally, a considerable number of wetland resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. It is, therefore, necessary for the city to ensure maximum protection for wetlands located in the corporate limits of the city by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands. 
                  (b)	Purpose. The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat.

                  Sec. 38-128. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Generalized wetland map means a map showing the general locations of wetlands within the county and the city. The generalized wetland map used is the National Wetlands Inventory as published by the United States Department of Interior. 
                  Hydric soils means soils that form as a result of saturated soil conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, formerly known as the Soil Conservation Service, an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture. 
                  Hydrophytic vegetation means macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions. 
                  Jurisdictional determination means an official, written statement or map signed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, stating whether a certain specified site is a wetland or is in a wetland. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland means a wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Temporary emergency permit means a temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified in section 38-130(c). 
                  Wetland means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similarly areas. 
                  Wetland delineation means the establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or an authority designated by the Corps. 
                  Wetland protection district means all wetlands within the city and shown on the generalized wetland map. 
                  (Code 1990, § 17-150; Ord. No. 313, § 10, 2-9-1999) 
                  Sec. 38-129. - Wetland protection district. 
                  (a)	Generally. This article shall apply to all lands within wetlands located in the corporate limits of the city. The generalized wetland map shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the chief administrative officer. 
                  (b)	Boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners that a subject site may be in a jurisdictional wetland or in proximity to a jurisdictional wetland, requiring the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to initiation of any development activity on the subject site. The generalized wetland map does not represent precise boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the county and the city, and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. 
                  (c)	Federal and state requirements stand. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (Code 1990, § 17-142; Ord. No. 313, § 2, 2-9-1999) 
                  Sec. 38-130. - Local development permits. 
                  (a)	Requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the permitting officer in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in subsection (b) of this section, or by other local development ordinances, shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development appears to be located within 50 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the permitting officer from review of the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following receipt by the local permitting officer of a copy of the section 404 permit or letter of permission issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  (b)	Permissible uses (uses as of right). The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, filling, draining or dredging except as provided herein. 
                  (1)	Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
                  (2)	Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
                  (3)	Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (4)	The continued cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall; however, be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
                  (5)	The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
                  (6)	Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
                  (c)	Temporary emergency permit. A temporary, emergency permit can be issued by the permitting officer for the following reasons: 
                  (1)	Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged, and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to the permitting officer, and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired, and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
                  (2)	Temporary water-level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations. 
                  (3)	Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of subsection (b)(4) of this section. 
                  (4)	Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided such facilities and structures are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland. 
                  (d)	Site plans. Applications for a local development permit within the generalized wetland protection district shall include a site plan, drawn to a scale of one inch equals 50 feet, unless a different scale is approved, in advance, by the permitting officer, with the following information: 
                  (1)	A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved with cross-sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on the cross-sectional drawings. 
                  (2)	A map of any wetland boundaries occurring within the site must be provided. This boundary may be included on other maps provided by the applicant. 
                  (3)	Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site and adjacent to the site for a distance of 200 feet. 
                  (4)	The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the subject site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body. 
                  (5)	Elevation of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than two feet; and no greater than one foot for slopes less than or equal to two percent. 
                  (6)	Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing hazardous or toxic materials released accidently. 
                  (7)	All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology. 
                  (e)	Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform with the specifications of said site plan. The site plan may be amended only with approval of the permitting officer. The permitting officer may require additional information deemed necessary to verify compliance with the provisions of this article or to evaluate the proposed use in terms of the purposes of this article. 
                  (f)	Subdivision approval in the wetland protection district. Any application for subdivision approval shall include a jurisdictional determination approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, subdivision approval will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter of permission. 
                  (g)	Subdivision design options in the wetland protection district. Any subdivision that includes jurisdictional wetlands shall be allowed and encouraged to use the following options: 
                  (1)	Lot size averaging. Lot size averaging is encouraged in single-family detached subdivisions as a means to work around wetland areas. The permitting officer may allow a reduction in lot size provided the same number of lots in the same subdivision are oversized by an equal or greater area. The maximum permissible reduction shall not exceed 25 percent of the minimum required lot area. The number of lots with areas reduced shall not exceed 25 percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision. The permitting officer shall allow no more than a 25 percent adjustment of rear, side and front setbacks for each affected lot. 
                  (2)	Cluster development. Clustering of residential development is encouraged. When considering subdivision approval, the permitting officer will allow incorporation of wetland or other significant natural areas as open space in the subdivision plan. Such plans should designate at least 25 percent of the gross land area as open space. Density shall be calculated by subtracting from the total acreage of a parcel, all land dedicated or in use for private or public roads, including all vehicular rights-of-way. The resultant acreage will then be divided by the minimum allowed lot size of the district to derive the number of lots permissible. 
                  (h)	Filing fee. At the time of the application, the applicant shall pay a filing fee per acre in the amount established by resolution of the city council. This fee may be used to retain expert consultants who will provide services pertaining to functional assessment, mitigation and wetland boundary determinations as deemed necessary by the permitting officer. 
                  (i)	Enforcement authority. The permitting officer is the department, office or individual assigned the responsibility of administering this article. The administrative authority is vested in the office of the chief administrative officer at city hall. 
                  (j)	Review procedures. The application shall be made to the permitting officer and will be reviewed within 30 days. The review period shall begin upon determination by the permitting officer that the application submitted is complete. The review period shall include the preparation of findings (approval, conditional approval or disapproval) by the permitting officer. The applicant will receive written notification of the findings of the permitting officer. If the review process is not completed within 30 days, the application is considered to be approved. 
                  (k)	Appeals. Any aggrieved party may appeal a decision under this article according to article XI of chapter 102, pertaining to zoning. 
                  (l)	Duration of permit validity. 
                  (1)	If construction described in the development permit has not commenced within six months from the date of issuance, the permit shall expire. 
                  (2)	If construction described in the development permit is suspended or abandoned after work has commenced, the permit shall expire six months after the date that work ceased. 
                  (3)	Written notice of the pending expiration of the development permit may be issued by the permitting officer, but no such notification is required.

                  (a)	Right of entry for examination. The permitting officer shall have authority to enter upon privately owned land for the purpose of performing duties required under this article, and may take or cause to be made such examinations, surveys or sampling as the permitting officer deems necessary. 
                  (b)	Right of entry for monitoring; enforcement. The permitting officer shall have authority to enter the subject site to monitor development and to enforce this article; issue permits hereunder; and address violations or threatened violations hereof by issuance of violation notices, administrative orders and civil and criminal actions. All costs, fees and expenses in connection with such actions may be recovered as damages against the violator. 
                  (c)	Assistance from other officials. Law enforcement officials or other officials having police powers in the jurisdiction shall have authority to assist the permitting officer with enforcement. 
                  (d)	Cease and desist orders. The permitting officer shall have authority to issue cease and desist orders in the event of any violation of this article. Cease and desist orders may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction, as identified herein. 
                  (e)	Bond requirement possible. The permitting officer may require a bond and with surety and conditions sufficient to secure compliance with the conditions set forth in the permit. The particular amount and the conditions of the bond shall be consistent with the purposes of this article. In the event of a breach of any condition of any such bond, the permitting officer may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction upon such bond and prosecute the same to judgment and execution. 
                  (f)	Removal of structures in violation. When the permitting officer determines a building or other structure has been constructed in violation of this article, the violator may be required to remove the structure at the discretion of the permitting officer. 
                  (g)	Restoration of vegetation removed in violation.

                  APPENDIX 
                  Source Material for the Preparation of Generalized Wetland Maps 
                  (1)	Available map resources. 
                  a.	National Wetlands Inventory Maps (NWI). NWI maps are the most commonly used maps. Most of these maps are at scales of 1:24,000 correspond to United State Geologic Survey (USGS) topographic maps. The minimum area mapped is usually one to three acres. Small wetlands and very narrow wetlands in river corridors may be missed. 
                  These maps were developed from interpretations of available aerial photographs; therefore, mapped boundaries of wetlands do not reflect jurisdictional boundaries [as would be determined if the federal delineation manual were used on the ground]. 
                  Only a small portion of the maps has been "ground-truthed," but nationwide efforts to assess the accuracy of the maps have been extensive. Accuracy varies upward from the 60 percent, with most maps being at least 90 percent accurate. 
                  The strength of these maps is the spatial resolution (often to within one acre, which is relatively good). NWI maps identify the location of wetlands and indicate wetland type using the Cowardin classification scheme. 
                  The limitations of these maps are that wetlands that were cultivated at the time of mapping are generally not depicted, and forested wetlands are poorly discriminated. In some areas, these two wetland types are a major portion of the wetlands resource. Particularly in areas of rapid growth and accelerated wetlands loss, many maps have become quickly outdated.

                  b.	County Soil Survey Maps. These maps range in scale from 1:15,840 to 1:31,680. Soil maps do not delineate wetlands, but rather their presence may be inferred from the occurrence of soils classified as "hydric" by the Soil Conservation Service. From accompanying soil interpretation record data, wetlands might cautiously be classified by type. These maps were developed by trained soil scientists who examined vertical soil profiles at regular intervals along ground transects and generalized subjectively from them to the surrounding landscape on the basis of landform, vegetation and other factors. 
                  These maps do not specify wetland type as do the NWI maps. Most published soil surveys report the acreage of each soil series in the survey area. Soil survey maps are extensively used as secondary data source for wetlands mapping. However, hydric soil inclusions (patches of hydric soil too small to map) are probably common in many soils mapped as non-hydric, but the extent to which this occurs is unknown. It should also be noted that some soils classified as hydric are not hydric everywhere they are mapped; marginally hydric soils indicate wetlands only in certain landscape positions. Caution should therefore be used when inferring the presence of wetlands from soils classified and mapped as hydric. 
                  The advantage of using these maps is that they are sometimes available in areas where NWI maps are not yet available. Soil surveys might be used, with caution, to infer locations of cropped wetlands not included in NWI maps; to differentiate among some wetland functional types (alluvial seasonally flooded vs. isolated seasonally flooded) when linked with the SCS SOIL5 database which describes the physical properties of each soil series; and to categorize hydrologic and water purification function of specific wetlands. 
                  Limitations of these maps are numerous. Many small but cumulatively significant areas that often are wetlands (with hydric soil inclusions) are not mapped because the soil classification systems used in soil survey maps classify soils in landscape groupings. Aquatic bed and many tidal or permanently flooded wetlands are typically mapped as open water, not wetlands, on SCS maps. Areas classified as having hydric soils are not always wetlands, in part because they may have been drained (either prior to or after the survey was conducted). This can lead to overestimation of current wetlands acreage. Many drained hydric soils can retain sufficient "hydric" features to result in their being classified by soil mappers as hydric even after decades of continuous drainage. Conversely, not all wetlands contain soils that are classified as hydric, and this can lead to underestimation of wetlands acreage. Wetlands may be the result of recent impoundment; in such areas, it typically takes at least a decade for hydric soil features to appear. Moreover, even the soils of some wetlands with hydric characteristics that have existed for decades do not appear on the SCS hydric soils list. 
                  Maps are available through: 
                  U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service field offices (generally located in the county seat of each county). 
                  c.	State Soil Geographic Data Base (STATSGO) and National Soil Geographic Data Base (NATSGO) maps. 
                  STATSGO maps are available at 1:25,000 scale with about 100 acres resolution. Digital coverage maps will be available by late 1993. These maps include soils on federal land. 
                  NATSGO maps are available at 1:3,000,000 and are currently available showing the entire United States. They do not include federal land. 
                  STATSGO maps are generally based on soil surveys completed since 1960. SCS has determined the map unit composition (the groupings of soil types mapped as a single polygon or unit) by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed SCS County Soil Survey maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize each whole map unit. 
                  Wetlands themselves are not delineated; rather their presence may be inferred from the presence of soils officially considered "hydric." From accompanying SOIL5 data, which describe the physical properties of each soil series, these wetlands landscapes might cautiously be classified by function. 
                  NATSGO maps are also generally based on soil surveys completed since 1960. Map units are the polygons of SCS's Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) map. The sample points of the National Resources Inventory (NRI) are statistically aggregated within each MLRA unit. Each NRI record keyed to the soil interpretation record (SOIL5) data base so that soil attributes relevant to wetlands function are available for each of the 300,000 NRI sample points. 
                  These maps are relatively new and have not been tested extensively against wetlands field data. 
                  Both map types are the only currently available maps from which the landscape-level water purification and flood control functions of wetlands might be inferred for all areas of the United States. 
                  The scale/resolution of the maps is inappropriate for most planning purposes at the local level. Also, these maps cannot be used to infer the functions of an individual wetland. Inferences of wetlands functions at the landscape level would be based on hydric soils, but not all hydric soils are wetlands. In the case of the STATSGO data, the soil mapping units do not necessarily coincide with physical boundaries that are relevant to defining landscape functional units (watersheds). This could lead to some imprecision in estimates compiled on that basis. The generation and compilation of thematic maps from STATSGO and NATSGO maps require a mainframe computer with adequate storage, advanced data base management and GIS software and a skilled computer technician. 
                  Maps are available from: 
                  National Cartographic Center, USDA Soil Conservation Service, Fort Worth, Texas. 
                  d.	Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Swampbuster Maps. These maps are mostly at a scale of 1:12,000 or 1:20,000 and primarily cover cropland and areas closely associated with cropland. 
                  Most maps were completed since 1987 and largely represent a one-time assessment; about five percent may be reassessed annually. 
                  Wetland boundaries were hand drawn on recent aerial photographs. The delineations were based on an overlay of hydric soils maps; hydrophytic vegetation and presence of surface water (as visible from aerial photographs from multiple years); and, in some cases, field checking to confirm wetlands status. 
                  These maps probably represent the most extensive, detailed and up-to-date map source for wetlands in certain areas. However, because these maps are relatively new, they are not widely used because of limited distribution. 
                  These maps are not for sale but can be viewed at state SCS offices. 
                  The strength of these maps is that they are a useful compliment to NWI maps because they include many of the wetlands that NWI misses, specifically, cropped and very small wetlands. 
                  The strength of these maps is that because wetland boundaries were drawn on aerial photographs not printed for mass distribution, the maps are difficult to access and compile and they often do not include prior converted wetlands.

                  ARTICLE II. - FIRE PROTECTION UTILITY ENTERPRISE FUND 

                  Sec. 42-25. - Purpose. 
                  This article establishes the Montezuma Fire Protection Utility and set[s] up the fire protection utility enterprise fund. 
                  (Ord. No. 386, § 1, 9-11-2012) 
                  Sec. 42-26. - Findings of fact. 
                  The Montezuma Mayor and Council make the following findings of fact: 
                  (1)	The City of Montezuma is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VI thereof, to create special service districts for the provision of services within such districts, and to levy and collect within such districts fees and assessments to pay, wholly or partially, the cost of providing such services therein. 
                  (2)	The City of Montezuma, Georgia, is authorized by its Charter to fix and establish fire protection service area limits and to extend, enlarge or restrict same from time to time to ensure effective delivery of such services. 
                  (3)	In promulgating the provisions contained in the article, Montezuma is acting pursuant to its authority as granted by the Georgia Constitution, and the laws of the State of Georgia and its City Charter, to provide fire protection and other emergency services to all properties within the city's service area. Fire protection and other emergency services are needed and provide benefits to all properties within the city's service area. 
                  (4)	The cost of managing, operating and maintaining the Montezuma Fire and Emergency Services Department, and the funding necessary for equipment, personnel and facilities thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in reasonable relationship to the services received by the public from the city's fire and emergency services program. 
                  (5)	The operational and financing analysis prepared by the city properly assesses and defines the city's fire protection service delivery needs, goals, priorities as well as the city fire department's funding strategy for delivery of those services. 
                  (6)	Given the city's fire protection program service delivery needs, goals, priorities and the funding strategy identified in the aforementioned financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of fire protection services, systems and facilities within the city in concert with other resource management programs. 
                  (7)	Fire protection services are applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, one service area encompassing all lands within the designated Montezuma Fire Protection Utility Service Area is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
                  (8)	It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of fire protection among the owners and/or occupants of all properties in proportion to the demands the properties to impose on the city's fire department which result in services being rendered to such properties and the owners and/or occupants thereof. The fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the service fee charge should be based on a reasonable correlation to the fire protection services made available and provided to all properties. 
                  (9)	The fire protection needs of the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety and welfare of the community. Provision of fire protection services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the city. 
                  (10)	A fire protection program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering fire protection services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to implement the defined level of service for fire protection within the city are through fire protection service fee charges and other funding mechanisms. 
                  (11)	A schedule of fire protection service fee charges based on the size of the structure and other criteria, is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of fire protection services throughout the city. 
                  (12)	Fire protection service fee charges may be supplemented by other types of fees and charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, general fund revenues, special assessments, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes (SPLOST) and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council. 
                  (13)	It is imperative that the revenue from all service fee charges for fire protection services, systems or facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such service fee charge revenues shall therefore be deposited into the city fire protection utility enterprise fund and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for fire protection capital and operating costs, or for other indebtedness for fire protection services. 
                  (14)	In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of Montezuma, Georgia, hereby concludes a fire protection utility, funded by a dedicated fire protection utility enterprise fund, is warranted as the best available means of addressing the community's fire protection service delivery needs. By separate ordinance, the city will enact a service charge rate structure to establish service fees for the provision of fire protection services to all properties within the defined Montezuma Fire Protection Utility Service Area.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 46-1. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Montezuma, Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
                  (Ord. No. 374, Art. 1, § A, 8-11-2009) 
                  Sec. 46-2. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)	The flood hazard areas of Montezuma, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)	These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 374, Art. 1, § B, 8-11-2009) 
                  Sec. 46-3. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. No. 374, Art. 1, § C, 8-11-2009)

                  (1)	To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)	To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)	To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)	To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)	To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)	To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)	To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
                  (Ord. No. 374, Art. 1, § D, 8-11-2009) 
                  Sec. 46-5. - Lands to which this chapter applies. 
                  This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Montezuma, Georgia.

                  Sec. 46-11. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
                  The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Montezuma, Georgia, or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
                  (Ord. No. 374, Art. 2, § G, 8-11-2009)

                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building.

                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities.

                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  ARTICLE III. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 46-61. - General standards. 
                  In ALL areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)	New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)	New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)	Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include ANY fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.	Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.	Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.	The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.	Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.	So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area, and 
                  c.	The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)	Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)	New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)	New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)	On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)	Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 46-62. - Specific standards. 
                  In ALL areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 46-61(4), "Elevated buildings". 
                  a.	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)	Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water-tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 46-37(6). 
                  (3)	Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.	All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.	Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.	The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.	All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection 46-61(6) above). 
                  d.	All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.	Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.	The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections a. and c., above. 
                  (4)	Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-62, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.	Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.	ONLY if subsection a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article.

                  Sec. 46-63. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-6, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), OR where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)	When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 46-6, then the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article. ONLY if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply: 
                  (2)	No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)	In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 46-61(4), "Elevated buildings". 
                  a.	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The floodplain administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-6, where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated, (zones AE) the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)	No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
                  (2)	New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with section 46-62.

                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-6, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)	All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 46-61(4), "Elevated buildings". 
                  The floodplain administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)	New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water-tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsections 46-37(1)c. and (2). 
                  (3)	Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  Sec. 46-81. - Variance and appeals. 
                  (a)	The planning and zoning board as established by the City of Montezuma shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)	The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (c)	Any person aggrieved by the decision of the planning and zoning board may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Macon County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)	Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if ANY increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)	In reviewing such requests, planning and zoning board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)	Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)	A variance shall be issued ONLY when there is: 
                  a.	A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
                  b.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)	The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)	The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)	Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the planning and zoning board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 54-1. - Flexibility and stability of organization. 
                  The ability of the department to make organizational adjustments to meet changing needs is essential in obtaining the maximum benefit from the expenditure of assigned resources. However, to ensure stability, the basic department structure should not be changed in the absence of the demonstrated need or to satisfy temporary requirements. There must be continuing staff inspections to ensure those departments organizational needs are being meet. In addition, each commanding officer has the responsibility to maintain the organizational viability of his command through constant evaluation. 
                  Sec. 54-2. - Chain of command; accountability. 
                  Any organization, including a law enforcement agency, cannot function without an organizational structure that assigns responsibilities or functions to specific individuals or groups of individuals. Each person employed by the department is responsible for certain functions and tasks. Additionally, each employee is held accountable for those tasks for which he is responsible. The function of an employee holding supervisory responsibilities is to see that people under his control are performing the tasks assigned to them. 
                  Sec. 54-3. - Speed traps, entrapment against policy. 
                  It is contrary to the policy of the department to engage in any practices resembling speed traps or luring persons into violations of the law. Such activities are not only unfair to the public, but arouse a direct resentment against law enforcement authorities and discredits the individuals concerned and the department permitting the same.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 70-1. - City personnel system. 
                  The city personnel policies establish a system of employment which recognizes that the employees covered by the system should be selected and promoted according to their knowledge, skills and abilities, and that employees who perform satisfactorily should be retained in their positions as long as the positions exist and regardless of factors extraneous to their performance and conduct. 
                  (Code 1990, app. A, § 1-100; Ord. No. 291, 9-10-1996) 
                  Sec. 70-2. - Establishment of policies. 
                  These personnel policies have been established by the governing authority of the city to provide a fair, equitable, and productive work environment for those employees covered by the system. This system and these policies have been enabled by ordinance adopted by the governing authority of the city. 
                  (Code 1990, app. A, § 1-200; Ord. No. 291, 9-10-1996) 
                  Sec. 70-3. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of the personnel policies is to establish a system of employment that implements and perpetuates the six recognized principles of public employment. Those principles are: 
                  (1)	Recruiting, selecting and advancing employees on the basis of their relative ability, knowledge and skills, including open consideration of qualified applicants for initial appointment; 
                  (2)	Providing equitable and adequate compensation; 
                  (3)	Training employees, as needed, to ensure high-quality performance; 
                  (4)	Retaining employees on the basis of the adequacy of their performance, correcting inadequate performance and separating employees whose inadequate performance cannot be corrected; 
                  (5)	Assuring fair treatment of applicants and employees in all aspects of personnel administration without regard to political affiliation, race, color, national origin, sex, religious creed, age or disability, and with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights as citizens; and 
                  (6)	Assuring that employees are protected against coercion for partisan political purposes and are prohibited from using their official authority for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the results of an election or a nomination for office.

                  Sec. 70-4. - Security of employment. 
                  O.C.G.A. § 36-34-2 permits municipal governing authorities to adopt personnel systems which establish the tenure of the employees. It is the intent of these policies to give regular employees the expectation of continued employment unless dismissed for cause, and a right to a hearing if dismissed. 
                  (Code 1990, app. A, § 1-350; Ord. No. 291, 9-10-1996) 
                  Sec. 70-5. - Coverage. 
                  These policies apply to the covered employees in all departments under the administration of the chief administrative officer. Federal equal employment law recognizes that neither elected officials nor members of their personal staff should be covered by legislation creating permanent positions. Therefore, the governing authority will determine which positions in the city are policy making, personal staff or appointments for specified terms, and exclude those positions from coverage by these policies. All other regular fulltime and regular parttime positions will be covered, and those positions will be included in the city's classification plan.

                  The chief administrative officer, as the chief executive officer, is responsible for administering these policies. 
                  (Code 1990, app. A, § 1-500; Ord. No. 291, 9-10-1996; Ord. No. 347, 1-13-2004) 
                  Sec. 70-7. - Policy changes. 
                  The governing authority reserves the right to amend these policies at any time, by resolution, if the change does not take away the employees' expectation of continued employment except when dismissed for cause. If amended or repealed, changes that adversely affect a property interest will apply only to those employees who are employed after the changes become effective and to those employed before the changes become effective who are voluntarily promoted or transferred to new positions after the changes become effective. 
                  (Code 1990, app. A, § 1-600; Ord. No. 291, 9-10-1996) 
                  Sec. 70-8. - Printing and distribution. 
                  The city personnel policies and procedures will be printed and distributed to each covered employee of the city. Each department head will be responsible for reviewing the policies and procedures with each employee in that department. Each employee will be required to acknowledge by signature that he has received and reviewed a copy of the policies and procedures. That signed acknowledgement will be filed in employee's personnel file.

                  Sec. 70-9. - Penalties. 
                  Any person who willfully violates any provision of the personnel policies will have one or more of the disciplinary actions specified herein taken against them.

                  As needed the chief administrative officer shall submit recommendations for revised or additional policies to the governing authority. A notice of the proposed changes must be posted in a conspicuous place in city hall for a period of at least 14 days prior to consideration by the governing authority. After the required 14 days have elapsed, and the amendment receives majority vote of approval by the city council, the proposed change shall have the full force and effect of law.

                  ARTICLE II. - STANDARDS OF CONDUCT 

                  Sec. 70-43. - Purpose of standards. 
                  (a)	Responsibilities of employees. Employees who work for the city are in a special category. They are not only employed by the city government; more importantly, they are paid by city taxpayers. Consequently, they have an obligation not only to their immediate supervisor, their department head, the chief administrative officer, and the mayor and council, but also to city taxpayers to ensure that they "get their money's worth." As a result, city employees live in a "glass house" and must adhere to high moral and ethical standards in work relationships and conduct. 
                  (b)	General guidelines. It is virtually impossible to set out specific rules to govern each employee's conduct in all duties of his job. This is not the intent of these standards. Rather, this is an attempt to present some frequent or common situations which arise and to provide general guidelines to assist in carrying out duties in a business like manner. 
                  (Code 1990, app. A, § 3-100; Ord. No. 291, 9-10-1996; Ord. No. 347, 1-13-2004) 
                  Sec. 70-44. - Use of privileged information. 
                  (a)	Prohibitions. Some city employees deal with matters of significant public interest. In this position, the employee should not use this privileged information to his own advantage or to provide friends or acquaintances with any advantages. 
                  (b)	Conflict of interest. If the employee has any outside financial interests which could be affected by city plans or activities, the employee should immediately report the situation to his supervisor. Each employee is responsible for ensuring that he does not release information relating to city business except upon approval of the chief administrative officer. 
                  (Code 1990, app. A, § 3-101; Ord. No. 291, 9-10-1996; Ord. No. 347, 1-13-2004) 
                  Sec. 70-45. - Outside activities. 
                  Employees are encouraged to engage in outside activities, including civic organizations. However, unless officially authorized by the chief administrative officer, all the activities shall be done on the employee's own time. In participating in outside activities, the employee should not disclose information that is not available to the public unless disclosure of the information has been authorized. 
                  (Code 1990, app. A, § 3-102; Ord. No. 291, 9-10-1996; Ord. No. 347, 1-13-2004) 
                  Sec. 70-46. - Attitude and common courtesy. 
                  When dealing with the public in any situation, especially on city business, city employees must do so in a courteous manner. No employee shall use profane language or show any sign of ill feeling, anger or disrespect. No employee shall engage in unnecessary conversation or gossip while on duty. Employees are prohibited from releasing news pertaining to the city's business, except upon approval of the chief administrative officer and pursuant to law. Every employee shall, at all times, conduct himself in a manner that reflects credit upon his department and the government of the city. 
                  (Code 1990, app. A, § 3-103; Ord. No. 291, 9-10-1996; Ord. No. 347, 1-13-2004) 
                  Sec. 70-47. - Channel of communication. 
                  (a)	Chain of command. For all matters to go before the mayor and council from any employee or department of the city, the following channel of communication shall be followed: The employee shall pass the communication or matter to be considered to his immediate supervisor; the supervisor shall pass it to the department head; the department head shall pass it to the chief administrative officer for appropriate action. If it is appropriate to pass it on to the mayor and council, the chief administrative officer shall do so. No communication shall be stopped by the supervisor or department head without the knowledge of the employee. 
                  (b)	Exceptions. Exceptions to this policy shall be complaints of harassment, unlawful discrimination or other unlawful acts by a supervisor or department head; in that situation, an employee may communicate the complaint directly to the chief administrative officer. 
                  (Code 1990, app. A, § 3-104; Ord. No. 291, 9-10-1996; Ord. No. 347, 1-13-2004) 
                  Sec. 70-48. - Outside employment. 
                  (a)	Service to city not to be adversely affected. No employee shall engage in any other employment, in any private business, or in the conduct of a profession during hours for which he is employed to work for the city, or outside the hours in a manner or to an extent which, in the opinion of the chief administrative officer, adversely affects his service to the city. 
                  (b)	Written approval required. Any outside employment requires written approval by the mayor upon recommendation of the employee's department head. 
                  (Code 1990, app. A, § 3-105; Ord. No. 291, 9-10-1996; Ord. No. 347, 1-13-2004) 
                  Sec. 70-49. - Voting rights. 
                  No employee shall be given or refused employment, suspended, discharged or disciplined because of his vote or failure to vote in any election. 
                  (Code 1990, app. A, § 3-106; Ord. No. 291, 9-10-1996) 
                  Sec. 70-50. - Prohibited activities. 
                  Because public employees are in positions created for the public and funded by the public, the public has the right to expect that the incumbents in the positions will not abuse the trust placed in them by the public. The employees of the city are expected to observe and honor the laws of the state and the ordinances of the city and the county. The following are some of the activities that are specifically prohibited: 
                  (1)	Acceptance of gifts and gratuities. No covered employee shall accept significant gifts or gratuities from anyone who might expect to receive anything in return from the city. 
                  (2)	Use of city-owned property, equipment and supplies. 
                  a.	Employees are entrusted with the use of public equipment and supplies. Disciplinary actions will be taken against employees who abuse or misuse city equipment or supplies or otherwise damage city property through negligence. 
                  b.	No employee shall take or use for personal purposes any city property, equipment or supplies. City property, equipment and supplies shall be used only in the manner authorized by mayor and council. Exceptions to this rule may occur in bona fide instances of emergency and can only be granted by the chief administrative officer. 
                  c.	Employees who are on call or on city business may be authorized by the chief administrative officer to take city vehicles to their residences. 
                  d.	License requirement. Employees driving city vehicles are required to have valid driver's licenses for the vehicles being driven as is required by state law, irrespective of whether the employee drives the vehicle on a regular, occasional or other basis, and whether or not this requirement is included or omitted in the job description of the class to which the employee was appointed. Violations, citations, fines or other actions taken by any police jurisdiction against any employee while driving a city vehicle in violation of rules shall be the responsibility of the employee and may be cause for disciplinary action. 
                  e.	Seat belt requirement. 
                  1.	City employees shall use the safety belts installed by the vehicle manufacturer properly adjusted and securely fastened when operating or riding in any city vehicle so equipped. 
                  2.	Lap belts must be properly secured in those city vehicles equipped with automatic safety belt systems that require the lap portion of the belt to be manually secured. 
                  3.	Drivers of city vehicles are responsible for insuring compliance by all occupants of the city vehicle that they are operating. Approved child safety restraints shall be used for all children of age, size, weight for which the restraints are prescribed by law. 
                  4.	No person shall operate a city vehicle in which any safety belt in the driver's seating position in inoperable. No person shall be transported in a seating position in which the safety restraint is inoperable. 
                  5.	No person shall modify, remove, deactivate or otherwise tamper with the vehicle safety belts except for vehicle maintenance and repair and not without the express authorization of the department head. 
                  6.	Personnel who discover an inoperable restraint system shall immediately report the defect to the appropriate supervisor. 
                  7.	Any person under arrest and being transported in city vehicles is required to be secured in the vehicle by a safety belt in all seating positions for which safety belts are provided by the vehicle manufacturer. 
                  8.	An officer operating in an undercover capacity may be exempt only if the officer believes that the use of the safety belt will compromise their identity. 
                  9.	When arriving at an emergency call or making a vehicle traffic stop, the operator may remove the safety restraint just prior to stopping for quick exit. 
                  (3)	Use of intoxicants. Employees shall not possess, be under the influence of, or consume any intoxicating drug such as alcohol during work hours. Employees shall not possess, consume, manufacture or distribute illegal controlled substances at any time, for those activities are unlawful. Failure to comply with this policy will lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. 
                  (4)	Causing garnishments. Employee indebtedness is a personal concern of the employee, but garnishments of multiple debts create administrative difficulties that will lead to disciplinary action. 
                  (5)	Sexual harassment. Unlawful sexual harassment will not be permitted in any department of the city. If anyone feels that unwelcome sexual advances or language is interfering with his productivity or comfort at the work place, or feels that any terms or conditions of employment depend on sexual favors, the employee should report to the appointing authority immediately. It should be understood that a claim of sexual harassment bypasses the normal grievance procedure, and that the claim can be expressed privately to the appointing authority. If the claimant feels that reporting to the appointing authority may adversely affect his employment, the claim may be expressed, in writing, through the chief administrative officer, to the city attorney, who shall advise the city council.

                  (1)	An employee of the city shall make every effort to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. An appearance of conflict exists when a reasonable person would conclude from the circumstances that the employee's ability to protect the public interest or perform public duties is compromised by personal interests.

                  (2)	An employee of the city shall excuse himself from any proceeding in which the employee's impartiality might reasonably be questioned due to the employee's personal or financial relationship with a participant in the proceeding. The term "participant" includes, but is not limited to, an owner, shareholder, partner, employee, resident, or agent of a business entity involved in the proceeding.

                  (2)	Where appropriate for purposes of tradition, ceremony, or inter-governmental relations, or when acting as a representative of the city, an employee may accept a gift on behalf of the city. If the gift retains value after its acceptance, the employee must:

                  (1)	Romantic or sexual relationships between a manager/supervisor and a directly reporting employee can cause real or perceived conflicts of interest. In order to prevent these conflicts, the city prohibits such relationships or any conduct that is intended or may reasonably be expected to lead to the formation of a romantic or sexual relationship between a manager/supervisor and an employee in a directly reporting relationship. This policy applies regardless of whether or not both parties freely consent to such relationships. Should a manager desire to date or become involved with a directly reporting employee, the manager should first resign from their position with the city. 
                  (2)	Should two employees within the same department but not in a directly reporting relationship desire to become involved in a romantic relationship, they should disclose the relationship to the department director who shall then make a decision regarding the effect of the relationship on work product and work flow within the department. If in the judgment of the department director, the relationship between two employees within the department creates a negative effect on departmental operations, then one of the two will be asked to transfer or resign their position with the city. 
                  (3)	By its prohibition of romantic and sexual relationships, the city does not intend to inhibit the social interaction (such as lunches or dinners or attendance at entertainment events) that are or should be an important part or extension of the working environment.

                  (1)	The use of lobbyists will not be required or preferred as a way to obtain access to employees. Employees will strongly encourage any lobbyist wishing to meet with the city official or staff regarding his client or principal to bring a principal of his client to the meeting.

                  (j)	Fair and equal access. Employees are required to afford all constituents fair and equal opportunity to express their concerns and ideas regarding city programs and policies without regard to their political affiliation, sophistication, or affluence. Recommendations and decisions made by employees in the performance of their duties shall be made without bias. 
                  (k)	Employment/board service. Employees may serve for compensation on any company or nonprofit organizations so long as services to the organizations would not have the potential to create a conflict and do not impair the employee's ability to discharge his public duties fully, faithfully, and impartially. 
                  (l)	Political activities. 
                  (1)	Employees wishing to take part in political activities are responsible for complying with applicable federal and state law. 
                  (2)	Employees are prohibited from soliciting or knowingly accepting any campaign contribution in a governmental building or office.

This does not apply when a government-owned building or any portion thereof is rented for the specific purpose of holding a campaign fundraiser. 
                  (3)	Employees are permitted to express their opinions on political subjects and candidates and to take an active part in political campaigns outside of working hours, including the wearing of badges or buttons and displaying of bumper stickers and posters. However, no city employee shall publicly endorse or actively support or campaign for any candidate for any city office, or for any other candidate while on duty, wearing a city uniform or driving a city vehicle. Employees are encouraged to vote. 
                  (4)	No employee shall seek or hold a compensated elected public office in the city. 
                  (m)	Personal use of telephone and Internet access.

                  (2)	City-provided Internet access is intended for public business. Employee use of the Internet may be recorded and monitored. No employee is permitted to use or access the Internet for pornographic, obscene, or other improper purposes. 
                  (n)	Waivers. There may be unique or compelling circumstances warranting exceptions to or waivers from these policies in certain individual cases. In those instances, prior written approval of the designated ethics officer is required. 
                  (o)	Sanctions. Each chief elected official shall make a copy of the code of ethics available to all employees and shall institute procedures for its enforcement consistent with all applicable state laws.

                  (2)	The conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive. 
                  Hostile environment means and includes any lewd sexual conduct, pictures, words, or touching that interferes with a person's job performance or creates an intimidating, offensive working or public service environment, even if there are no occurrences of tangible or economic loss. 
                  Prohibited behavior means and can include, for purposes of this policy, unwelcome sexual remarks or compliments, sexual jokes, sexual innuendo or propositions, sexually suggestive gestures or facial expressions, sexual remarks about a person's clothing or body, exhibiting sexually explicit publications or materials, kissing, touching, and sexual contact. 
                  Quid pro quo literally means "this for that" and exists when submission to, or rejection of, such conduct is used as a basis for employment decisions such as raises or promotions or affects public services. 
                  Sexual harassment means, as defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), unwelcome sexual advances, request for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. 
                  Sec. 70-97. - Complaint procedure and investigation. 
                  (a)	Reporting. If the employee feels that this policy has been violated, regardless of whether it is by a fellow worker, a supervisor, or a member of the general public, he employee should report the incident immediately to their department director and the human resources manager. If the human resources manager is involved in the behavior, the report should be made to the director of operations. Any supervisor who receives a complaint related to harassing or offensive behavior or who has reason to believe that such behavior is occurring shall report these concerns to the human resources manager or to the director of operations. All reports of harassing or offensive behavior will be investigated promptly, fairly and discreetly. Investigatory procedures may vary from case to case depending upon the circumstances. 
                  (b)	Confidentiality of investigation. The investigation will be conducted as confidentially as possible. All employees have a responsibility both to cooperate fully with the investigation and to keep the matter confidential whether the employee is the accused person, the complainant or merely a potential witness. Persons who are interviewed are prohibited from discussing the matter with co-workers, friends or management. The city will keep the information it gathers as confidential as possible, consistent with state and federal laws and the needs of the investigation. 
                  Sec. 70-98. - Corrective action. 
                  If management concludes that a complaint of harassment has merit, appropriate action will be taken. Resolutions can include, but not necessarily be limited to, an apology, a transfer, direction to stop the offensive behavior, counseling or training, verbal or written warning, suspension with or without pay or termination. In the event that harassment or offensive behavior reoccurs, it should immediately be reported to the human resources manager or to the director of operations. Employees may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. Nonemployees may be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency and/or barred from the premises.

                  (h)	Administrative salary adjustments. The salary of each employee shall be reviewed annually at budget preparation time by the department head for the purpose of determining which employees shall be recommended to receive increase in pay. Personnel records, performance and length of service will be considered in making recommendations, with major emphasis on evaluation of services rendered by the employee. Based on the employees' evaluation, the department head will make appropriate recommendations to the chief administrative officer for consideration by the mayor and council.

An employee may donate all or any part of his earned annual leave to another employee by giving written notice thereof to the city's personnel department and providing such additional information as the department may require to accomplish the transfer of the donated hours. The donation of annual leave may be made only by an employee whose pay scale is greater than that of the employee receiving the donation. 
                  [f]	Request for leave. Employees must request all annual leave, in writing on approved leave request forms. The leave must be approved by the department head or designee before the leave is taken.

                  Sec. 70-183. - Sick leave. 
                  Sick leave is leave accumulated to be taken for bona fide illness or injury, or other medical-related necessities such as physician appointments, medical examinations, and dental appointments. Sick leave is available for the employee's personal health care as well as for the care of members of the immediate family. 
                  (1)	Eligibility. All covered employees, both regular and working test, shall accrue sick leave from the date of employment in a covered position. 
                  (2)	Accumulation rate. Sick leave will be accumulated at the rate of three hours per pay period, for a total of 78 hours per year. Any employee paid on any other pay cycle or work cycle more or less than 40 hours per week shall receive pro rata sick leave converted from the above to the pay cycle. 
                  (3)	Maximum accumulation. Sick leave may not be accrued in excess of 720 hours. Personnel working more or less than 40 hours per week will have this maximum amount prorated. Employees will not be paid for accumulated sick leave upon separation except if separation is due to retirement or reduction in force lay off. 
                  (4)	Reporting. The employee shall report any sick leave absence prior to his scheduled work time if possible, and if not, the employee shall see that his absence is reported within one hour after the scheduled time for the employee to begin work. 
                  (5)	Approval. Sick leave requires the approval of the department head or his designee. 
                  (6)	Physician's certificate. A medical statement signed by a licensed physician may be required to substantiate sick leave for: 
                  1.	Absence of three or more consecutive work days; 
                  2.	To support a request for sick leave during annual leave; and 
                  3.	At any time when absence recurs frequently or habitually, provided the employee has been warned. 
                  (7)	Temporary disability. When a disabled employee has exhausted all accrued sick and annual leave, the employee may be placed on leave without pay, depending on the duration of the absence and the need to fill the position. A doctor's statement will be required to determine the length of leave necessary. Maternity and other temporarily disabling conditions associated with pregnancy will be treated as any other disability. 
                  (8)	Reserved. 
                  (Ord. No. 389, 3-14-2017) 
                  Sec. 70-184. - Military leave. 
                  State law requires that paid leave be granted to members of the Reserve and National Guard under certain conditions, and leave of absence is required under other conditions. The city's policy is to grant leave in compliance with the law. 
                  (1)	Ordered duty. In compliance with O.C.G.A. § 38-2-279, any employee ordered to military duty shall be placed on military leave with pay for a period of time not exceeding a total of 18 days in any one calendar year and not exceeding 18 days in any one continuous period of absence. 
                  (2)	Declared emergency. According to O.C.G.A. § 38-2-279, in the event the governor declares an emergency and orders any employee to state active duty as a member of the National Guard, the employee shall receive pay for a period not exceeding 30 days in any one calendar year and not exceeding 30 days in any one continuous period of active duty service. 
                  Sec. 70-185. - Court leave. 
                  An employee performing court duty as a subpoenaed witness or juror will be granted leave with pay. The employee must endorse to the city all fees received from the court. 
                  Sec. 70-186. - Leave of absence. 
                  According to O.C.G.A. § 38-2-279, any voluntary member of the Reserve or National Guard shall be entitled to absent himself and shall be deemed to have a leave of absence as an employee while in attendance at any service school conducted by the armed forces of the United States for a period up to six months during any four-year period. Leave of absence may be granted in cases of temporary disability and possibly other emergency situations. In the case of a regular leave of absence (nonmilitary), leave prevents a break in service, but no benefits such as leave or time toward retirement shall accrue during leave-of-absence. For military leave-of-absence, federal guidelines on benefits will be followed. 
                  Sec. 70-187. - Leave without pay. 
                  (a)	Leave without pay is normally shortterm leave similar to annual and sick leave. Leave without pay may be requested: 
                  (1)	For annual leave when the employee either does not have sufficient accumulated leave; or 
                  (2)	When the employee prefers to take leave without pay to avoid taking accumulated annual or sick leave. 
                  (b)	In addition to the above, an employee may be placed on leave without pay when leave is taken without prior approval or when an employee is absent without authorization. No annual or sick leave may be accrued when an employee is in a leave without pay status. The employee will be required to reimburse the city for all health insurance premiums paid on his behalf during period of leave. (This provision does not apply to leave without pay under the provisions set forth under section 70-189, pertaining to family and medical leave.) 
                  Sec. 70-188. - Administrative leave. 
                  Administrative leave is leave with pay that is ordered by the appointing authority or his designee to meet a need of the organization. An employee may be ordered to be absent from the work place, with pay, while internal investigations are being conducted, while awaiting further communications or hearings, under conditions described in section 70-281, or under any other conditions where the appointing authority considers administrative leave appropriate. 
                  Sec. 70-189. - Family and medical leave. 
                  (a)	Unpaid leave allowed. Effective August 5, 1993 the city will provide employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year for childbirth, adoption, or the serious illness of any employee or close family member. Health care coverage at the level and under the conditions coverage would have been provided if the employee had continued in employment continuously for the duration of the leave will be maintained by the city. In addition, an employee who takes family and medical leave (FAML) will be restored to his previous position or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay and other terms and conditions of employment. 
                  (b)	Eligibility. In order to be eligible for FAML, an employee: 
                  (1)	Must have been employed by the city for at least 12 months. 
                  (2)	Have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period prior to commencement of the leave. 
                  (3)	Be requesting leave for: 
                  a.	The birth of a child or the placement of a child for adoption or foster care (the leave may only be taken within 12 months of that birth or placement); 
                  b.	To provide care for a spouse, a child, a dependent son or daughter over the age of 18, or a parent who has a serious health condition; or 
                  c.	A serious health condition that renders the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's position. 
                  (c)	Advance request required. The employee must provide at least 30 days' notice of his request for FAML if the reason is for an anticipated birth, child placement or planned medical treatment. In addition, the employee must make reasonable efforts to schedule leave in a manner that does not unduly disrupt the city operations. However, these requirements may be waived if a medical emergency or other unforeseen events occur that make it impossible for the employee to comply with advance notice requirements. 
                  (d)	Other leave to be exhausted. The employee must first use all of his vacation and sick leave before FAML will be granted. 
                  (e)	Suspension of accruals, certain benefits. No accrual of seniority, privileges or benefits (except for health insurance) are allowed for an employee who is on FAML. 
                  (f)	Medical certificate to be provided. An employee returning from FAML for his own serious health condition must provide a medical certificate signed by a physician. This certificate will be limited to the particular health condition that caused the employee's need for FAML. If the certificate is not furnished, employee will not be returned to his former position. However, if feasible, employee may be transferred to an equivalent position if it does not place an undue hardship on the city. 
                  (g)	Denial of reinstatement. Certain key employees may be denied reinstatement under specified conditions. The term "key employees" is defined as those salaried employees within the highest ten percent pay bracket of the city workforce. These key employees may be denied reinstatement if: 
                  (1)	It is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to city operations; 
                  (2)	The city notifies the employee that it intends to deny restoration at the time the city determines that such an injury would occur; and 
                  (3)	In any case where the leave has commenced and the employee elects not to return to work within a reasonable period of time after receipt of the notice. 
                  (h)	Recovery of health coverage costs by city. The city may recapture the health insurance premiums it paid for maintaining coverage for the employee on leave if the employee does not return to work after the leave period expires. However, this recovery provision does not apply to: 
                  (1)	A key employee who continues leave despite notice that reinstatement will be denied. 
                  (2)	An employee who fails to return to work due to the continuation, recurrence, or onset of the serious health condition of either the employee of his family members, or because of other circumstances beyond the employee's control.

                  (b)	Observation. 
                  (1)	Working on holidays. Employees may be required to work during the above holidays. All regular fulltime, regular parttime, and probationary shift employees (police department, fire department, etc.) shall be paid for each holiday as an extra day (eight hours) on their paycheck, due to the fact that they are required to work a definite number of hours per year and hence never really have any holidays except in the case where a shift employee is required to work on a holiday, when they shall be paid at double time for all hours worked on that holiday, but not less than eight hours. 
                  (2)	Occurrence on weekends. If a holiday falls on Saturday, it will generally be observed on the preceding Friday. If the holiday falls on a Sunday, it will generally by observed on the following Monday. 
                  (3)	Attendance. In order to receive pay for an official holiday, the employee must either: 
                  a.	Be at work on the workdays immediately preceding and succeeding the holiday; or 
                  b.	Must be on approved paid leave on those days.

                  In calculating the accrual of annual and sick leave, accrual begins on the day of original appointment in a covered position. If an employee takes regular leave of absence (nonmilitary), the anniversary date will be moved forward by as many calendar days as the employee was on leave of absence.

                  Fulltime employees are expected to devote primary attention to the requirements of their city jobs. It is permissible to obtain outside employment if the employee first gains written approval from the appropriate department head and the request to obtain outside employment is approved by the chief administrative officer. The general rules which apply to outside employment are: 
                  (1)	There is no conflict between the outside job and the city job in working hours. 
                  (2)	The employee's job efficiency is not reduced. 
                  (3)	There is no conflict of interest that could cause embarrassment to the city or to the employee.

                  (c)	An employee transferred in accordance with the provisions of these policies shall maintain the same status (regular or working test) as he had in the previous position.

                  (b)	Separation during work test period. At any time during the initial work test period of employment, an employee may be separated from his position by the chief administrative officer without the right of appeal or hearing, and without notice.

                  Sec. 70-279. - Types of disciplinary actions. 
                  The six disciplinary actions fall into two general categories: reprimands and adverse actions. 
                  (1)	Reprimands. A reprimand is a formal means of communicating to the employee a warning that a problem exists and that it must be corrected. There are two degrees of formality, the oral reprimand and the written reprimand. 
                  a.	Oral reprimand. In an oral reprimand, the department head will verbally and privately explain to the employee that he is being reprimanded and describe the problem and what must be done to correct the problem. Department head will document that oral reprimand occurred. 
                  b.	Written reprimand. In the written reprimand, the employee will receive a written statement describing the problem and what must be done to correct the problem. The reprimand will also contain a statement describing the probable consequences of not correcting the problem. If the employee is at work, the written statement will be given to the employee during a private interview. 
                  (2)	Adverse actions. An adverse action is an action taken against a regular employee by the appointing authority or his designee for cause, which results in a suspension without pay, salary reduction, demotion or dismissal. 
                  a.	Suspension without pay. An employee may be suspended without pay for any or any combination of the above causes. The suspension without pay shall not exceed 30 days. 
                  b.	Salary reduction. An employee's salary may be reduced from one pay step to a lower step for any, or any combination of the above causes. The salary reduction does not constitute a demotion in pay grade. 
                  c.	Demotion. An employee may be demoted from one pay grade to a lower grade for any or any combination of the above causes, if a lower position is open and if the employee is qualified to perform the work at the lower position. A disciplinary demotion must include a decrease in salary. 
                  d.	Dismissal. An employee may be dismissed for any or any combination of the above causes, when it is necessary to remove the employee from the work place immediately or permanently. 
                  (Code 1990, app. A, § 9-300; Ord. No. 291, 9-10-1996) 
                  Sec. 70-280. - Notification and response procedure. 
                  Once it has been determined that an adverse action should be taken, the following notification and response procedure will be observed: 
                  (1)	Notice of proposed adverse action. The appointing authority or his designee will give the employee a written notification of the proposed adverse action 15 days prior to the effective date of the action. The notification will contain the following: 
                  a.	The effective date of the action; 
                  b.	The specific charges or reasons for the action; 
                  c.	A statement informing the employee that he may respond to a named official, either orally or in writing, within ten days of the notice of proposed adverse action; 
                  d.	A warning that failure to respond to the named official will result in a waiver of all further appeal rights; and 
                  e.	To be included only in the case of dismissal: A statement informing the employee that he has a right to a name-clearing hearing before the governing body, even if he does not respond or appeal, if he feels that publication of the causes of dismissal will falsely stigmatize him. 
                  (2)	Employee response to proposal. The employee may respond in person or in writing to the named official within ten days of receiving the notice of proposed adverse action. 
                  (3)	Notice of final action. The appointing authority or designee, after considering the employee's response, if any, will give the employee a written notification of the decision on the action to be taken within two days of the effective date of the action. The notification will contain a statement informing the employee of his right to appeal the action. 
                  (4)	Postponement of deadlines. If the employee responds to the named official, the official may postpone the deadline for the final notice by a specific number of days to conduct further investigation, with written consent from the employee. If the deadline for the final notice is postponed, the effective date of the final action will be postponed by as many days.

                  Sec. 70-281. - Emergency action. 
                  The appointing authority or the designee may take immediate action against an employee under emergency situations. The immediate action will be to suspend the employee with pay, under section 70-188, administrative leave, until an investigation can be conducted. If the employee is unable to communicate or respond, the employee will be placed on leave without pay until it is determined that the employee cannot return to work or until the employee can respond. Examples of emergency situations are: When crimes of moral turpitude are committed; when an employee may be injurious to himself; fellow workers or the general public; when an employee may damage public property; or when an employee is found to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

                  Sec. 70-311. - Communication of grievance. 
                  The grievance procedure is a communications process for hearing grievable claims of employees. 
                  (Code 1990, app. A, § 10-100; Ord. No. 291, 9-10-1996) 
                  Sec. 70-312. - Purpose of grievance procedure. 
                  The purpose of the employee grievance procedure is to provide an orderly process for hearing the grievable claims of permanent employees and claims of unlawful discrimination by working test employees. The object of the process is to reach a fair and equitable decision in a timely manner. The employee and manager should make an effort to resolve any grievance informally before initiating a formal procedure. 
                  (Code 1990, app. A, § 10-200; Ord. No. 291, 9-10-1996) 
                  Sec. 70-313. - Basis for grievance. 
                  A grievance is a claim by a regular employee alleging: 
                  (1)	That his employment has been adversely affected by unfair treatment; 
                  (2)	Unsafe or unhealthy working conditions; 
                  (3)	Erroneous or capricious application of city policies and procedures; 
                  (4)	Unlawful discrimination; or 
                  (5)	A claim by a working test employee alleging unlawful discrimination.

                  Sec. 70-314. - Filing written grievance. 
                  An employee may file a written grievance with his immediate supervisor within 15 days after the occurrence of the event being grieved, or within 15 days after becoming aware of the event. The grievance statement must be submitted to the supervisor in writing, and it must state the specific claim and the specific relief desired. 
                  (Code 1990, app. A, § 10-202; Ord. No. 291, 9-10-1996) 
                  Sec. 70-315. - Levels of review. 
                  The employee grievance procedure must provide for a minimum of two steps, or levels of review, for covered employees below the position of department head. Normally, the department head will hear the grievance in the first step and the appointing authority will hear the grievance in the second step. For department heads and other employees reporting directly to the appointing authority, the sole grievance hearing will be conducted by the appointing authority.

                  If the claim is grievable, the first hearing will be held within 20 days after the grievance is filed. The first hearing officer must notify the grievant of his decision in writing within 15 days of the hearing. If the grievant wishes to have a second hearing, he will notify the department head within 15 days after receiving the initial decision. The second hearing officer will notify the grievant of his decision within 15 days of the hearing.

                  Sec. 70-317. - Hearing procedure. 
                  The grievance hearing is intended to create a formal means for the grievant to communicate his complaint in an informal setting. Therefore, the hearing officer will not be argumentative nor present management's opinions at the hearing. The hearing officer will listen to the grievant's presentation and question the grievant to obtain pertinent facts about the claim and the situation relevant to the claim. The employee will represent himself, but may bring witnesses to the hearing to testify. Both the grievant and the hearing officer may question the witnesses. An employee with a disability may be accompanied by an interpreter when that is necessary.

                  After the hearing, the hearing officer will review the claim, evidence, and requested relief, and will report his decision in writing to the grievant according to the schedule in section 70-316.

                  It is the policy of the city that the abuse of alcohol and drugs by public employees is detrimental to the health, safety and morals of the public. This was recognized by President Reagan in the issuance of Executive Order 12564 establishing a drug-free federal work place and recognized by the United States Congress authorizing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services through legislation to establish plans for implementing federal employee drug testing programs. The purpose of this division is to establish reasonable standards and procedures for drug and alcohol testing of city employees and applicants for city employment. The city council recognizes that individuals have certain rights to privacy and dignity, and in establishing this division, the city council has tried to balance the city's interest in protecting the health and safety of its employees and the public, with the employees' legitimate expectations of privacy. To accomplish this, certain procedural safeguards, limitations and due process guarantees are established by this division.

                  (7)	Phencyclidine; 
                  (8)	THC (marijuana); 
                  (9)	All controlled substances as defined by O.C.G.A. §§ 16-13-25 through 16-13-29. 
                  (Code 1990, § 2-49; Ord. No. 214, § 2, 12-13-1988) 
                  Sec. 70-522. - Laboratory testing requirements. 
                  (a)	Alcohol testing. Testing for alcohol may be done by use of a photointoximeter provided that the employee consents to the use of that machine; otherwise, testing for alcohol must be done by urinalysis. 
                  (b)	Testing locales. All drug and alcohol testing of employees and applicants shall be conducted at medical facilities or laboratories selected by the city, which medical facilities or laboratories have been certified by federal or state agencies to conduct the test. If the employee consents to an intoximeter test for alcohol use, the test may be done at any local law enforcement agency with a certified machine and certified operator. 
                  (Code 1990, § 2-50; Ord. No. 214, § 15, 12-13-1988) 
                  Sec. 70-523. - Obtaining samples. 
                  Urine samples shall be provided in a private restroom stall or similar enclosure so that employees or applicants may not be viewed while providing the sample. Applicants and employees must be given hospital gowns to wear while they are providing test samples in order to ensure that there is no tampering with those samples. Street clothes, bags, briefcases, purses and other containers may not be carried into the test area. The water in the commode shall be colored with blue dye to protect against dilution of test samples.

                  All information from an employee's or applicant's drug and alcohol test is confidential and only those with the need to know are to be informed of test results. Disclosure of test results to any person, agency or organization without a need to know is prohibited unless written authorization is obtained from the employee or applicant. The results of a positive drug test shall not be released until the results are confirmed. 
                  (Code 1990, § 2-52; Ord. No. 214, § 13, 12-13-1988) 
                  Sec. 70-525. - Confirmation of initial test result. 
                  (a)	Additional test. An employee whose initial test (urinalysis) yields a positive result shall be given a second test using a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry test unless the employee acknowledges the accuracy of the first test and waives the second test. The second test shall use a portion of the same test sample withdrawn from the employee and used in the first test. 
                  (b)	Right of employee to select other testing agency. The city shall arrange with the county medical center or some other organization that has been certified by the state or federal government as an agency authorized to conduct the testing procedure, and all costs of testing will be paid by the city. The employee has the right to have testing done by any other agency or laboratory approved by federal or state agencies to conduct the tests, but the cost of the testing must be paid by the employee. 
                  (c)	Results of second test. If the second test confirms the positive test result, the employee will be notified of the results in writing by the department head or city administrator. The letter of notification shall identify the particular substance found and its concentration level and upon request the employee will be given a copy of the test result that is forwarded to the city by the testing agency.

                  (a)	Job applicants. Job applicants will be denied employment with the city if their initial test result is a positive result. Applicants shall be informed in writing of their rejection and the reason why. The applicant will have the right to be considered for employment after a period of 12 months, and may be considered after that time only after the applicant has demonstrated proof that he is no longer abusing alcohol or drugs. 
                  (b)	Employees. If an employee's positive test result on the initial test is confirmed by the second test, the employee is subject to disciplinary action pursuant to the provisions of article X of this chapter, up to and including discharge from employment. Factors to be considered in determining the appropriate disciplinary action include but are not limited to the employee's work history, length of employment, current job performance, evidence of any past disciplinary action, extent and nature of abuse, prospect of successful rehabilitation and nature of job position. 
                  (Code 1990, § 2-54; Ord. No. 214, § 16, 12-13-1988) 
                  Sec. 70-527. - Right to hearing. 
                  (a)	Written request; legal representation permitted. If an employee's positive test result has been confirmed, the employee is entitled to a hearing as provided by article X of this chapter before any disciplinary action may be taken against the employee. In order to avail himself of the hearing, the employee must make written request for the hearing to the city administrator within five days from receipt by the employee of the confirmed test results. Employees may be represented by legal counsel, present evidence and witnesses on their behalf, confront and cross examine the evidence and witnesses on their behalf, confront and cross examine the evidence and witnesses to be used against them. 
                  (b)	Evidence required. No adverse personnel action may be taken against an employee based on a confirmed positive drug or alcohol test result unless the hearing officer finds by a preponderance of the evidence the following: 
                  (1)	The employee's supervisor had reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee was under the influence of drugs or alcohol while on the job; 
                  (2)	The employee's drug test results are accurate. 
                  (c)	Results; appeal rights. Within five days following the close of the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a written decision and a brief summary of the facts and evidence supporting the decision. The employee shall have the same appeal rights to the city council as provided for in this chapter.

                  Sec. 70-528. - Employee assistance program. 
                  (a)	Alternative to disciplinary action. Disciplinary action against an employee, especially termination of employment, can have drastic results to the employee and could deprive the city of the service of an otherwise capable employee. It may be more beneficial to the city and to the employee to present that employee with a choice between rehabilitation and disciplinary action, especially termination from employment. Accordingly, it is the policy of the city to offer the choice to an employee who otherwise has demonstrated the ability to rid himself from abuse of alcohol or drugs and this policy shall be considered by the city administrator in arriving at an appropriate decision on the action to be taken against the employee who has a confirmed positive test result. The basic idea behind this program is that an employee's alcohol or drug abuse can be prevented by supplying the employee with information about the problems that these substances can create and the availability of services that are available to assist abusers of drug and alcohol (rehabilitation). 
                  (b)	Use of sick and other leave for rehabilitation; expenses to employee. If an employee must take time off to take part in a rehabilitation program, the absence will be treated as sick leave and if that is used up, the employee must use vacation leave. When all leave has been used up, the employee will be in a nonpaying status. All expenses of rehabilitation must be paid by the employee without cost to the city, but the city will cooperate as best as it can in obtaining the employee financial assistance through the city insurance program for employees. 
                  (c)	Continued employment in probationary status; random tests required. All employees with confirmed positive test results who are allowed to remain in an employed status with the city shall be in a probationary status for a period of 12 months from confirmation of the test and will be subject to random alcohol or drug testing for that 12-month period. Confirmation of a positive test during this probationary period will subject the employee to mandatory discharge from employment and will make the employee ineligible to apply for a job with the city for a period of 12 months thereafter.

                  (a)	Compliance with federal regulations. The purpose of this policy is to establish compliance with the Federal Highway Administration regulations requiring drug and alcohol testing for commercial driver's license holders.

                  (b)	Mandatory testing; employee assistance program. The city has a significant interest in the health and safety of its employees and the citizens of the community. In furtherance of that interest, it is the policy of the city to take those steps necessary to ensure that its employees perform their duties and responsibilities free of the influence of drugs and alcohol. Employees are encouraged to seek confidential counseling on problems associated with alcohol and drug abuse through the employee assistance program. There will be mandatory drug and alcohol testing for employees and job applicants under the circumstances outlined in this policy.

                  (a)	Pre-employment drug testing. All individuals who are covered by this policy must pass a drug test as a post-offer condition of employment. 
                  (b)	Reasonable suspicion testing. Employees subject to this policy shall submit to a drug or alcohol test when the city reasonably suspects that this policy (except the prohibitions against possession, transfer or sale of alcohol) may have been or is presently being violated. A referral for testing will be based on contemporaneous, articulable observations. The referrals will be made by supervisory personnel who have received training concerning the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol use. Alcohol testing for reasonable suspicion may only be conducted just before, during or after an employee operates a commercial vehicle.

                  (c)	Post-accident testing. Following an accident (as defined above) involving a commercial vehicle, the driver is required to submit to alcohol and drug tests. Testing should occur as soon as possible, but may not exceed four hours after the accident for alcohol testing and eight hours after the accident for drug testing. A driver who is subject to post-accident testing must remain readily available for the testing and may not take any action to interfere with testing or the results of testing. Drivers who do not comply with post-accident testing requirements will be considered to have refused to submit to testing and will be subject to sanctions for refusal to test as provided in this policy. 
                  (d)	Random testing. Employees covered by this policy will be subject to random, unannounced alcohol and drug testing. 
                  (e)	Return to duty testing. Employees who have violated this policy, including those who have tested positive on a drug or alcohol test, and who under the discipline policy are allowed to return to work, must test negative prior to being released for duty. A return to duty test following alcohol misuse may not exceed an alcohol concentration of 0.01. 
                  (f)	Follow-up testing. An employee who is referred for assistance related to alcohol misuse or use of drugs is subject to unannounced follow-up testing for a period not to exceed 60 months as directed by a substance abuse professional and the city.

                  (2)	Failure to provide adequate urine for drug testing without a valid medical explanation after the employee has received notice of the requirement for urine testing in accordance with the procedures manual; 
                  (3)	Engaging in conduct that obstructs the testing process. 
                  (b)	Refusal to submit to a test shall be considered the same as a positive test result.

Any employee who comes forth and notifies the city of alcohol or drug abuse problems will be given the assistance extended to employees with any other illness. Any such program, however, may not interfere with the tests required by these rules. For example, a driver may not identify himself as unfit to drive after having been notified of a random or reasonable suspicion test and expect to avoid the consequences for a positive test or a refusal to test. In addition, voluntarily seeking assistance does not excuse any failure to comply with all of the provisions of this policy or other policies of the city. 
                  (b)	Use of sick and other leave for treatment. Sick leave, vacation leave or leave of absence without pay may be granted for treatment and rehabilitation as in other illnesses. Insurance coverage for treatment will be provided to the extent of individual coverage. Confidentiality of information will be maintained as much as possible at all times.

                  Sec. 74-1. - Purpose. 
                  This chapter provides standards for on-site and off-site signs to safeguard life, health, property, safety, and public welfare, while encouraging creativity, variety and compatibility, and enhancement of the city's image. The provisions of this chapter are intended to: 
                  (1)	Encourage creative and well-designed signs that contribute in a positive way to the city's visual environment, express local character, and help develop a distinctive image for the city. Predictable and mediocre signs are discouraged. 
                  (2)	Encourage signs that are responsive to the aesthetics and character of their particular location, adjacent buildings and uses, and the surrounding neighborhood. Signs should be compatible and integrated with the building's architectural design and with other signs on the property. 
                  (3)	Recognize that signs are a necessary form of communication, and provide flexibility within the sign review/approval process to allow for unique circumstances and creativity.

                  Sec. 74-2. - Applicability. 
                  (a)	Sign permits required. To ensure compliance with the regulations of this chapter, a sign permit shall be required in order to apply, erect, move, alter, reconstruct, or repair any permanent or temporary sign, except signs that are exempt from permits in compliance with section 74-11 (exemptions from sign permits). See section 74-10 for sign permit application and processing requirements. 
                  (b)	Sign standards. The sign standards provided in this chapter are intended to apply to signs in each zoning district in the city. Only signs authorized by this chapter shall be allowed. 
                  (c)	New zoning districts. If a new zoning district is created after the enactment of this chapter, the planning and zoning commission shall have the authority to make determinations as to the applicability of appropriate signs until this chapter is amended to govern the new zoning district. 
                  (d)	Design guidelines. The city's sign design guidelines will be used in the evaluation of sign permit applications to ensure that signs are well designed, compatible with their surroundings, and do not detract from the overall visual quality of the city.

For example, 20 square feet of sign area requires 40 square feet of landscaped area. The planning and zoning commission may reduce or waive this requirement if it is determined that the additional landscaping would not contribute significantly to the overall aesthetic character of the project. 
                  (f)	Time and/or temperature signs. A time and/or temperature sign may be permitted on a site in addition to the other signs allowed by this chapter. 
                  (1)	Maximum area and height. The sign shall have a maximum area of ten square feet, and shall comply with the height requirements established by section 74-4 (sign standards by zoning district). 
                  (2)	Design. The sign shall be designed in a manner that is compatible with other signs on the site and with the structure on which it is placed.

                  (1)	Location. The sign shall not be placed to obstruct any portion of a window, doorway, transom, or other architectural detail. 
                  (2)	Maximum area and height. The sign shall not project above the edge of the roof of a structure, and shall comply with the height requirements established by section 74-4 (sign standards by zoning district).

                  (Code 1990, § 18-10; Ord. No. 310, 10-20-1998) 
                  Sec. 74-12. - Comprehensive sign program. 
                  (a)	Purpose. A comprehensive sign program is intended to integrate the design of the signs proposed for a development project with the design of the structures, into a unified architectural statement. A comprehensive sign program provides a means for defining common sign regulations for multi-tenant projects, to encourage maximum incentive and latitude in the design and display of multiple signs and to achieve, not circumvent, the intent of this chapter. 
                  (b)	Applicability. The approval of a comprehensive sign program shall be required whenever any of the following circumstances exist, or whenever an applicant requests the approval of a comprehensive sign program: 
                  (1)	Two or more separate tenant spaces are to be created on the same parcel; 
                  (2)	Five or more nonexempt signs are proposed for a new or existing development; and 
                  (3)	The planning and zoning commission determines that a comprehensive sign program is needed because of special project characteristics (e.g., the size of proposed signs, limited site visibility, a business within a business, the location of the site relative to major transportation routes, etc.). 
                  (c)	Approval authority. A comprehensive sign program shall be approved through the granting of a sign permit for a comprehensive sign program by the planning and zoning commission. 
                  (d)	Application requirements. A sign permit application for a comprehensive sign program shall include all information and materials required by the department, and the filing fee based on the same fee schedule as a building permit. 
                  (e)	Standards. A comprehensive sign program shall comply with the following standards: 
                  (1)	The program shall comply with the purpose of this chapter, the sign design guidelines and the overall intent of this section; 
                  (2)	The signs shall enhance the overall development, be in harmony with, and relate visually to other signs included in the comprehensive sign program, to the structures and/or developments they identify, and to surrounding development; 
                  (3)	The program shall accommodate future revisions that may be required because of changes in use or tenants; and 
                  (4)	The program shall comply with the standards of this chapter, except that flexibility is allowed with regard to sign area, number, location, and/or height to the extent that the comprehensive sign program will enhance the overall development and will more fully accomplish the purposes of this chapter. 
                  (f)	Revisions to comprehensive sign programs. Revisions to a comprehensive sign program may be approved by the planning and zoning commission if the intent of the original approval is not affected. Revisions that would substantially deviate from the original approval shall require the approval of a new comprehensive sign program.

                  Sec. 74-13. - Abandoned signs. 
                  A sign and all supporting structures (see section 74-5(g)) shall be removed by the owner or lessee of the premises upon which the sign is located when the business that it advertises is no longer conducted on the premises. The sign shall be removed within 30 days of the close of business. The requirements of this section shall also apply to signs advertising products which are no longer sold on the premises.

                  Sec. 74-14. - Damaged or removed signs. 
                  When a sign is damaged by any cause, the sign must be repaired or removed within 30 days of the date on which the damage occurred. When a sign is removed for any purpose, the supporting structures for the sign must also be removed as stated in section 74-5(g).

                  Sec. 74-15. - Illegal signs. 
                  (a)	Penalties. Illegal signs shall be subject to the administrative remedies of this Code. 
                  (b)	Removal of illegal signs in the public right-of-way. The planning and zoning commission may cause the removal of any sign within the public right-of-way or on property that is otherwise abandoned that has been placed there without first complying with the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (c)	Storage of removed signs. Signs removed in compliance with this section shall be stored by the city for 30 days, during which they may be recovered by the owner only upon payment to the city for costs of removal and storage. If not recovered within the 30-day period, the sign and supporting structure shall be declared abandoned and title shall vest with the city. The costs of removal and storage (up to 30 days) may be billed to the owner. If not paid, the applicable costs may be imposed as a tax lien against the property.

                  Sec. 74-16. - Sign design guidelines. 
                  The following guidelines should be considered in the design of all signs within the city. These guidelines are intended to complement other requirements in the previous sections of this chapter. 
                  (1)	Design compatibility. 
                  a.	Creative design encouraged. Signs should make a positive contribution to the general appearance of the street and commercial area in which they are located. A well-designed sign can be a major asset to a building. The city encourages imaginative and innovative sign design. The creative sign application procedure is specifically designed for artistic and unusual signs that might not fit the standard sign regulations and categories. 
                  b.	Proportionate size and scale. The scale of signs should be appropriate for the building on which they are placed and the area in which they are located. The size and shape of a sign should be proportionate with the scale of the structure. 
                  c.	Integration with design of building. Signs should not obscure architectural features. Their design should be integrated with the design of the building. A well-designed building facade or storefront is created by the careful coordination of sign and architectural design and overall color scheme. Signs in multiple-tenant buildings should be designed to complement or enhance the other signs in the building.

                  d.	Reduced impact on residential areas. Because residential and commercial uses generally exist in close proximity, signs should be designed and located so that they have little or no impact on adjacent residential neighborhoods. 
                  Figure SG-2 

                  e.	Sign placement to enhance facade. Place wall signs to establish facade rhythm, scale and proportion where facade rhythm doesn't exist. On buildings that have a monolithic or plain facade, signs can establish or continue appropriate design rhythm, scale, and proportion. 
                  Figure SG-3 

                  f.	Pedestrian-oriented signs encouraged. It is desirable and encouraged to include a pedestrian-oriented sign as one of the permitted signs for a business. Pedestrian-oriented signs are signs that are designed for and directed toward pedestrians so that they can easily and comfortably read the sign as they stand adjacent to the business. 
                  Figure SG-4 

                  g.	Painting directly on building. As an alternative to an attached sign, lettering may be painted directly on the building facade. However, signs should not be painted directly over ornamental and architectural features or over brick and stone surfaces of buildings. 
                  (2)	Color. 
                  a.	Select colors carefully. Color is one of the most important aspects of visual communication. It can be used to catch the eye or to communicate ideas or feelings. Colors should be selected to contribute to legibility and design integrity. Even the most carefully thought-out sign may be unattractive and a poor communicator because of poor color selection. Too many colors used thoughtlessly can confuse and negate the message of a sign. 
                  b.	Use contrasting colors. Contrast is an important influence on the legibility of signs. A substantial contrast should be provided between the color and material of the background and the letters or symbols to make the sign easier to read in both day and night. Light letters on a dark background or dark letters on a light background are most legible. 
                  Figure SG-5 

                  c.	Avoid using too many colors. Colors or color combinations that interfere with legibility of the sign copy or that interfere with viewer identification of other signs should be avoided. Small accents of several colors may make a sign unique and attractive, but the competition of large areas of many different colors often decreases readability. 
                  d.	Use complementary colors. Sign colors should complement the colors used on the structures and the project as a whole. 
                  (3)	Materials. 
                  a.	Sign materials. The following sign materials are recommended: 
                  1.	Wood (carved, sandblasted, etched, and properly sealed, primed and painted, or stained). 
                  2.	Metal (formed, etched, cast, engraved, and properly primed and painted or factory-coated to protect against corrosion). 
                  3.	High density pre-formed foam or similar material. New materials may be very appropriate if properly designed in a manner consistent with these guidelines, and painted or otherwise finished to complement the architecture. 
                  4.	Custom neon tubing, in the form of graphics or lettering, may be incorporated into several allowed sign types. 
                  b.	Compatibility of materials. Sign materials should be compatible with the design of the face of the facade where they are placed. The selected materials should contribute to the legibility of the sign. For example, glossy finishes are often difficult to read because of glare and reflections. 
                  c.	Appropriate materials. Paper and cloth signs are not suitable for exterior use (except on awnings) because they deteriorate quickly. Paper and cloth signs are appropriate for interior temporary use only. The use of interior signs on paper or cloth should be the result of careful thinking about readability and the image of the business. 
                  (4)	Sign legibility. An effective sign should do more than attract attention, it should communicate a message. Usually, this is a question of the readability of words and phrases. The most significant influence on legibility is lettering. 
                  a.	Pedestrian-oriented signs. Make signs smaller if they are oriented to pedestrians. The pedestrian-oriented sign is usually read from a distance of 15 to 20 feet; the vehicle-oriented sign is viewed from a much greater distance. The closer a sign's viewing distance, the smaller that sign need be. See the following table. 
                  LETTERING SIZE FOR PEDESTRIAN-ORIENTED SIGNS 

                   
                  Figure SG-6 

                  b.	Use a brief message. A brief message should be used whenever possible. The fewer the words, the more effective the sign. A sign with a brief, succinct message is easier to read and looks more attractive. Evaluate each word. If the word does not contribute directly to the basic message of the sign, it detracts from it and probably should be deleted. 
                  c.	Space letters and words carefully. Letters and words should not be spaced too close together. Crowding of letters, words or lines will make any sign more difficult to read. Conversely, over-spacing these elements causes the viewer to read each item individually, again obscuring the message. As a general rule, letters should not occupy more than 75 percent of sign panel area. See Figure SG-7. 
                  Figure SG-7 

                  d.	Limit the number of letter styles. The number of lettering styles should be limited in order to increase legibility. A general rule to follow is to limit the number of different letter types to no more than two for small signs and three for larger signs. Intricate typefaces and symbols that are difficult to read reduce the sign's ability to communicate. 
                  Figure SG-8 

                  e.	Use symbols and logos. Symbols and logos can be used in place of words wherever appropriate. Pictographic images will usually register more quickly in the viewer's mind than a written message. 
                  Figure SG-9 

                  (5)	Sign illumination. The possible illumination of a sign should be carefully considered. Like color, illumination can provide more effective visual communication, or can confuse the message. Imaginative and innovative lighting techniques for signs are encouraged. 
                  a.	Use illumination only if necessary. Consider if the sign needs to be lighted at all. Lights in the window display may be sufficient to identify the business. This is particularly true if good window graphics are used. Often, nearby street lights provide ample illumination of a sign after dark. 
                  Figure SG-10 

                  b.	Use a direct light source. If the sign can be illuminated by a direct source of light (e.g., spotlight), this is usually the best arrangement because the sign will appear to be better integrated with the building's architecture. Light fixtures supported in front of the structure cast light on the sign and generally a portion of the face of the structure as well. Direct lighting emphasizes the continuity of the structure's surface, and signs become an integral part of the facade. Direct lighting is also appropriate because it produces a more intimate ambiance on the street. The lighting of signs should be considered as an element in a building's overall lighting design. 
                  Figure SG-11 

                  Figure SG-12 

                  c.	Shield the light source. Whenever direct lighting fixtures are used (fluorescent or incandescent), care should be taken to properly shield the light source to prevent glare from spilling over into residential areas and any public right-of-way. Signs should be lighted only to the minimum level required for nighttime readability. 
                  d.	Backlighted signs. Backlighted, solid letters are encouraged. Signs consisting of opaque individually cut letters mounted directly on a structure can often use a distinctive element of the structure's facade as a backdrop, thereby providing a better integration of the sign with the structure.

                  (a)	Assessed to all premises. For the purpose provided in this division, there is hereby charged and assessed to each premises or facility served by connection with the sewer system of the city, or otherwise discharging sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly into the sewer system, a sewer service charge at the established rate. 
                  (b)	Basis for charges. The sewer service charge shall be based upon the quantity of water used by the premises or facility therein or thereon as the same is measured by a water meter there in use, or as otherwise currently established. 
                  (c)	Use of private water. Water used from private sources shall be metered as required in section 94-294 and will be figured at prevailing city water rates, and the sewer service charges shall be billed accordingly.

                  Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the superintendent that a significant portion of the water measured by the water meter does not enter the sewer system, then the superintendent may require or permit the installation of additional meters or other devices as may be deemed necessary to establish that portion that does enter the sewer system, and the corrected meter flow will be used for billing of the sewer service charge. All such additional facilities will be provided by the owner at the premises concerned or other interested parties at no expense to the city.

                  Sec. 94-296. - Surcharge for heavier concentrations of pollutants. 
                  (a)	When the five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), fats, oil and grease (FOG), or any other pollutant concentrations from a user are greater than the range of concentration of these pollutants in normal domestic sewage, a surcharge may be levied as follows: 
                  (1)	A base surcharge of $250.00 per month for exceeding the pollutant limitations. 
                  (2)	When the five-day BOD exceeds 250 parts per million, a surcharge of $0.10 per pound of excess BOD shall apply. 
                  (3)	When the total suspended solids concentration exceeds 250 parts per million, a surcharge of $0.01 per pound of excess suspended solids shall apply. 
                  (4)	When the fats, oil and grease concentration exceeds 100 parts per million, a surcharge of $0.10 per pound excess fats, oil and grease shall apply. 
                  (b)	The monthly surcharge for each pollutant shall be computed as follows: 
                  Surcharge = 8.34 × (Q ÷ 1,000,000} × {X - C} × R 

                   
                  The surcharge for each pollutant shall be based on a monthly average of each pollutant or a combined daily poundage calculation for the month. The method of a monthly average or a daily calculation of poundage shall be determined by the frequency and strength of the waste. 
                  The total surcharge shall be the base monthly charge ($250.00) plus the surcharges for each pollutant that exceeds the base concentration for that month. 
                  (c)	Sampling requirements: 
                  (1)	The flow metering and sample point shall be located between the users last unit process and before entering the collection system. 
                  (2)	The user shall meter the discharge daily with acceptable metering equipment and report totals to the city by the fifth day of the following month. 
                  (3)	The city shall have access to flow metering equipment. 
                  (4)	Annual calibration is required for flow measuring equipment. 
                  (5)	Sampling frequency shall be determined by the amount, frequency and strength of the discharge. If the user is required to monitor pollutant concentrations under an existing industrial pretreatment permit then the user will supply a copy of the monthly results to the city. These results may be used or more testing may be required. If more testing is required it shall be preformed at the city's expense and the user shall be required to provide the city with a composite sample on a weekly schedule to be determined by the frequency and strength of discharge. Composite samples shall consist of at least five flow proportional samples over an eight-hour period, automated samplers are preferred. Sample analysis shall be performed by an EPA approved laboratory. 
                  (6)	The user shall provide the city with a discharge schedule. 
                  (7)	The city shall have access to the users samplers to monitor and collect samples.

                  (a)	The purpose of this article is to establish protective regulations for trees in the city to better control problems with flooding, soil conservation, air pollution and noise in the city and to make the city a healthier and safer place in which to live. 
                  (b)	The intent of this article is to: 
                  (1)	Establish a minimum landscape development requirement on publicly and privately developed land use areas with the exclusion, however, of single-family, two-family residential land uses and agricultural land uses; 
                  (2)	Encourage the protection of existing trees and the planting of new trees which do and will enhance the value and beauty of property and are a valid asset to the community. It is in the public interest and welfare to protect the trees which the city stands to lose unless protective measures are taken. The intent is not punitive or to cause hardship to any individual, private or public company that uses care and diligence to protect trees within the city.

                  The boundaries of the zoning districts are hereby established as shown on the map entitled Zoning Districts Map—Montezuma, Georgia, dated March 1975 and certified by the chief administrative officer. Said map is hereby made part of this chapter; it shall be on file in the office of the chief administrative officer and available for public inspection.

                  (1)	Where district boundaries are depicted as approximately following the centerline of streets or highways, centerlines of streams or drainageways, street lines, or highway right-of-way lines, such centerlines, street lines, or highway right-of-way lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
                  (2)	Where district boundaries are so depicted that they approximately follow the lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries. 
                  (3)	Where district boundaries are so depicted that they are approximately parallel to the centerlines of streets, highways, or railroads, or rights-of-way of same, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on said zoning map. 
                  (4)	Where a district boundary line as appearing on the zoning map divided a lot in single ownership at the time of enactment of this chapter, the district requirements for the least restricted portion of such lot shall be deemed to apply to the whole therefor, provided that such extension shall not include any part of such a lot more than 35 feet beyond the district boundary line.

                  Sec. 102-134. - Agricultural district, A-1. 
                  It is the intent of the A-1 agricultural district to provide for the continued existence of agricultural uses, and lower density residential development than is found in the R-1 residential district. The A-1 district comprises that portion of the city which is primarily rural in nature, but which can be expected to experience urban development in the future. The following uses are permitted in the A-1 district: 
                  (1)	Any type of agriculture use. 
                  (2)	Any use permitted in the R-1 residential district.

                  Sec. 102-135. - Single-family residential district, R-1. 
                  The R-1 single-family residential district is composed chiefly of existing low-density residential areas of the city, and vacant or open areas where similar residential development appears likely to occur. This is the most restrictive residential district. The principal use of land is for single-family dwellings and related recreational, religious and educational facilities normally required to provide an orderly and attractive residential area. These residential areas are intended to be defined and protected from the encroachment of uses which are not appropriate to a residential environment. Stability of property values, attractiveness, order and efficiency are encouraged by providing for adequate light, air and open space for dwellings and related facilities and through consideration of the proper functional relationship of the different uses. The following uses are permitted in the R-1 district: 
                  (1)	Single-family dwellings, except trailers and mobile homes. 
                  (2)	Agriculture, excluding the commercial raising of poultry and livestock. 
                  (3)	Church bulletin boards not exceeding 20 square feet in area. 
                  (4)	Churches, fraternal organizations and clubs not operating for a profit, provided that: 
                  a.	There is a planted buffer strip at least ten feet wide along the side and rear lines; and 
                  b.	The buildings are located not less than 50 feet from any lot line. 
                  (5)	Customary accessory uses or buildings. 
                  (6)	Customary incidental home occupations including the professional offices of an architect, artist, beautician, dentist, engineer, lawyer, and physician, provided there is no external evidence of such occupations except an announcement sign not more than two square feet in area and that the operations are conducted within a dwelling by not more than one person in addition to those persons residing therein. Off-street parking provisions of section 102-106 are applicable to incidental home occupations. 
                  (7)	Substations, electric or gas, provided that: 
                  a.	The structures are placed not less than 50 feet from any property line; 
                  b.	The structures are enclosed by a woven wire fence at least eight feet high; 
                  c.	No vehicles or equipment are stored on the premises; and 
                  d.	The lot includes a planted buffer strip at least ten feet wide along the side and rear property lines. 
                  (8)	Public buildings, structures and grounds, except cemeteries. 
                  (9)	Schools, including private schools, nursery schools and kindergartens. The off-street parking provisions of section 102-106, are applicable to these uses. 
                  (10)	Signs not more than six square feet in area advertising the sale or rental of the property on which they are located.

                  It is the intent of the R-2 multifamily residential district to provide for a less restricted type of residential development at higher densities but under similar environmental conditions as found in the R-1 district. The principal use of land may range from single-family to multiple-family and garden apartment uses. Certain uses which are more compatible functionally with intensive residential uses than with commercial uses are permitted. The recreational, religious, and educational facilities normally required to provide an orderly and attractive residential area are permitted. Stability of property values, attractiveness, order and efficiency are encouraged by providing for adequate light, air and open space for dwellings and related facilities and through consideration of the proper functional relationship of each use permitted in the district. The following uses are permitted in the R-2 district: 
                  (1)	Any use permitted in the R-1 district. 
                  (2)	Multifamily residence.

                  It is the intent of the R-3 multifamily residential district to provide for a less restricted type of residential development at higher densities but under similar environmental conditions as found in the R-1 district. The principal use of land may range from single-family to multiple-family and garden apartment uses. Certain uses which are more compatible functionally with intensive residential uses than with commercial uses are permitted. The recreational, religious, and educational facilities normally required to provide an orderly and attractive residential area are permitted. Stability of property values, attractiveness, order and efficiency are encouraged by providing for adequate light, air and open space for dwellings and related facilities and through consideration of the proper functional relationship of each use permitted in the district. The following uses are permitted in the R-3 district: 
                  (1)	Any use permitted in the R-1 district. 
                  (2)	Multifamily residence. 
                  (3)	Boardinghouses and roominghouses. 
                  (4)	Hospitals. 
                  (5)	House trailers (mobile homes) shall be permitted provided that:

The yard and other space requirements of the district in which the piece of land is located may be reduced by the smallest amount that will permit reasonable use of the property as a building site; however, in no case shall the building inspector permit any lot in a residential district to be used as a building site which is less than 4,000 square feet in total area, 25 feet in width, or has front, side and rear yard setbacks of less than 15 feet (front), three feet (side), and five feet (rear), respectively.

In such cases, the setback on such lots may be less than the required setback but not less than the average of the setbacks of the aforementioned existing buildings.
