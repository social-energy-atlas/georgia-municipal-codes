PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Unified Government of Cusseta-Chattahoochee County, Georgia. The Unified Government is the successor to the governing authorities of the City of Cusetta, Georgia and Chattahoochee County, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the Commission (references as "U.G. Ord."), together ordinances adopted by the City of Cusetta, Georgia (referenced as "City Ord.") and ordinance adopted by Chattahoochee County Georgia (referenced as "County Ord."). The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and K. Barrington, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Donald Moore, Chairman of the Unified Government Commission, Mr. William C. Moore, Unified Government Attorney and Mr. David George, Unified Government Manager for cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the unified government readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the unified government's affairs.

ARTICLE I. - UNIFICATION, CREATION, BOUNDARIES, STATUS, AND POWERS OF UNIFIED GOVERNMENT 

Sec. 1-101. - Unification of county and city; creation of unified government; Cusseta-Chattahoochee County. 
(a)  The governmental and corporate powers, duties, and functions now vested in the governing authority of the City of Cusseta, a municipal corporation chartered by an Act of the General Assembly of Georgia, approved April 17, 1975 (Ga. L. 1975, p. 3617), are hereby unified with the governmental and corporate powers, duties, and functions of Chattahoochee County. This unification shall result in the creation and establishment of a single county-wide government with powers and jurisdiction throughout the territorial limits of Chattahoochee County, which single government shall supersede and replace the governments of the City of Cusseta and Chattahoochee County. Said county-wide government shall be a new political entity, a body politic and corporate, and a political subdivision of the state, to be known as the "Unified Government of Cusseta-Chattahoochee County, Georgia," (herein at times called the "Unified Government,") having all the governmental and corporate powers, duties, and functions heretofore held by and vested in the City of Cusseta and Chattahoochee County, and also the powers, duties, and functions provided in this Charter. The unified government shall be a public corporation; shall have perpetual existence; shall adopt a common seal; shall, without the necessity or formality of a deed, bill of sale, or other instrument of transfer, own, possess, and hold all the properties of whatsoever kind or nature, assets, contracts, franchises, things, rights, privileges, immunities, and real and personal property theretofore owned, possessed, enjoyed, or held by the City of Cusseta or Chattahoochee County; and by the name of Cusseta-Chattahoochee County, Georgia, shall be capable of suing and being sued when authorized by this Charter and by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia. From and after the effective date of this Charter, the political subdivision known as Chattahoochee County, Georgia, and the municipal corporation known as the City of Cusseta, Georgia, shall be unified into the said new political entity herein created.

L. 2001, p. 4305). 
Sec. 1-102. - Boundaries.

However, such limits may be altered and changed from time to time as provided by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia pertaining to counties. 
Sec. 1-103. - Status of unified government as municipal corporation and county. 
The unified government shall be deemed to be both a municipal corporation and a county throughout the total territory of said government.

This authority shall include but shall not be limited to the authority to adopt home rule ordinances and resolutions as provided in Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia. 
(c)  In addition to the foregoing, the unified government shall have all rights, powers, duties, privileges, and authority herein conferred or herein enlarged, and such other rights, powers, duties, privileges, and authority as may be necessary and proper for carrying the same into execution, and also all rights, powers, duties, privileges, and authority, whether express or implied, that may be now vested in or hereafter granted to counties or municipal corporations, or both, by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia, including the powers vested in the unified government by this Charter. 
(d)  The unified government, in addition to the rights, duties, powers, privileges, and authority expressly conferred upon it by this Charter, shall have the right, duty, power, privilege, and authority to exercise and enjoy all other powers, duties, functions, rights, privileges, and immunities necessary and proper to promote or protect the safety, health, peace, security, and general welfare of said government and its constituents and to exercise all implied powers necessary to carry into execution all powers granted in this Charter as fully and completely as if such powers were fully enumerated herein and to do and perform all of the acts pertaining to its property, affairs, and local government which are necessary or proper in the legitimate exercise of its corporate powers and governmental duties and functions. 
(e)  No enumeration of any right, power, privilege, or authority hereinafter made shall be construed as limiting or abolishing any right, power, privilege or authority hereinabove set forth. 
(f)  In addition to and supplementary to all other powers which it may possess, and by way of illustration and not of limitation, the unified government shall have the powers specifically enumerated in Section 7-114 of this Charter. 
Sec. 1-105. - Taxing districts. 
(a)  The unified government shall divide the county into two or more taxing districts.

Additionally, in the taxing district of the former City of Cusseta, the unified government shall levy such taxes as are necessary to retire any other indebtedness of the City of Cusseta which is outstanding on the effective date of the abolishment of the City of Cusseta. Such taxing districts may also include one or more service districts. 
(b)  Taxes shall be assessed, levied, and collected in accordance with the kind, character, type, degree, and level of services provided by the government within said service districts, and the rate and manner of taxation may vary in any one district from that in another or other districts. 
(c)  The unified government may also establish special services districts, which shall embrace such territory or territories for which provision is made by the Commission for additional or higher levels of services provided by the unified government. 
(d)  In the establishment or modification of service districts and special services districts, the unified government shall hold one or more public hearings thereon at which all interested persons affected thereby shall have an opportunity to be heard. Notice of the time, place, and date of such hearings shall be published in the official legal organ of Chattahoochee County at least once a week during the two weeks immediately preceding the date of hearing. 
Sec. 1-106. - Construction. 
The powers of the unified government shall be construed liberally in favor of the unified government. The specific mention or failure to mention particular powers in this Charter shall not be construed as limiting in any way the general powers of the unified government as provided in this article. It is the intention hereof to grant to the unified government full power and right to exercise all governmental authority authorized by the Constitution and laws of Georgia which is necessary for the effective operation and conduct of the unified government within its territory and for the conduct of all of its affairs.

                  (a)  Declaration of local emergency. 
                  (1)  Grant of authority. In the event of an actual or threatened occurrence of a disaster or emergency, which may result in the large-scale loss of life, injury, property damage or destruction or in the major disruption of routine community affairs, business or governmental operations in the county and which is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant extraordinary assistance by federal, state and local departments and agencies to supplement the efforts of available public and private resources, the chair of the board of commission may declare a local emergency for Cusseta-Chattahoochee County. The form of the declaration shall be similar to that provided in subsection (b) of this Code section. 
                  (2)  Request for state assistance. Consistent with a declaration of local emergency, the chair may request the governor to provide assistance, provided that the disaster or emergency is beyond the capacity of the county to meet adequately and state assistance is necessary to supplement local efforts to save lives and protect property, public health and safety, or to avert or lessen the threat of a disaster. 
                  (3)  Continuance. The declaration of local emergency shall continue until the chair finds that emergency conditions no longer exist, at which time, the chair shall execute and file with the clerk of the board of commission a document marking the end of the state of emergency. No state of local emergency shall continue for longer than 30 days, unless renewed by the chair. The board of commission may, by resolution, end a state of local emergency at any time. 
                  (4)  Effect of declaration of emergency. 
                  a.  Activation of emergency operations plan. A declaration of emergency by the governor or a declaration of local emergency by the chair shall automatically activate the county emergency operations plan and shall be the authority for deployment of personnel and use of any forces to which the plan applies and for use or distribution of any supplies, equipment, materials, and facilities assembled, stockpiled or arranged to be made available pursuant to the Georgia Emergency Management Act or any other laws applicable to emergencies or disasters.

                  2.  In responding and conducting necessary and appropriate investigations, the director or his/her designee is authorized to enter at a reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting sites involved with emergency management functions. The director is authorized to execute a right of entry and/or agreement to use property for these purposes on behalf of the county; however, any such document shall be later presented for ratification at a meeting of the board of commission. 
                  3.  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the county who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials. Nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while that individual is in the process of carrying out his or her official duties. 
                  b.  Emergency powers. Following a declaration of emergency and during the continuance of such state of emergency, the chair is authorized to implement local emergency measures to protect life and property or to bring the emergency situation under control. In exercising this authority, the chair may cause to become effective any of the following sections of this chapter as appropriate: Section 9-5 (registration of building and repair services) to become effective if the governor declares a state of emergency; and section 9-6 (closed or restricted areas and curfews). If any of these sections are included in a declaration of local emergency, the same shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the board of commission and shall be in effect until the declaration of local emergency has terminated. 
                  c.  Authority to waive procedures and fees. Pursuant to a declaration of emergency, the board of commission is authorized to cause to be effective any of the subsections of section 9-4 of this chapter as appropriate. The implementation of such subsections shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the board of commission. 
                  d.  Additional emergency powers. The chair of the board of commission shall have, and may exercise for such period as the declared emergency exists or continues, the following additional emergency powers: 
                  1.  To direct and compel the evacuation of all or part of the population from any stricken or threatened area, for the preservation of life or other disaster mitigation, response or recovery; 
                  2.  To prescribe routes, modes of transportation and destinations in connection with evacuation; 
                  3.  To suspend or limit the sale, dispensing or transportation of alcoholic beverages, firearms, explosives and flammable liquids and substances; 
                  4.  To make provision for the availability and use of temporary emergency housing, emergency shelters and/or emergency medical shelters.

                  6.  To utilize all available resources of the county and subordinate agencies over which the county has budgetary control as reasonably necessary to cope with the emergency or disaster; 
                  7.  To utilize public property when necessary to cope with the emergency or disaster or when there is compelling necessity for the protection of lives, health and welfare; and/or the property of citizens; 
                  8.  To suspend any law, Code provision or regulation prescribing the procedures for conduct of county business, or the orders, rules or regulations of any county agency, if strict compliance with any ordinance, resolution, order, rule or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency or disaster, provided that such suspension shall provide for the minimum deviation from the requirements under the circumstances and further provided that, when practicable, specialists shall be assigned to avoid adverse effects resulting from such suspension; 
                  9.  To provide benefits to citizens upon execution of an intergovernmental agreement for grants to meet disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs of individuals or families adversely affected by an emergency or disaster in cases where the individuals or families are unable to meet the expenses or needs from other means, provided that such grants are authorized only when matching state or federal funds are available for such purposes; 
                  10.  To perform and exercise such other functions, powers and duties as may be deemed necessary to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population, including individuals with household pets and service animals prior to, during and following a major disaster or emergency. 
                  (b)  Form of declaration of local emergency.

                  Sec. 9-4. - Authority to waive procedures and fee structures. 
                  (a)  County business. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or chair of the board of commission the affairs and business of the county may be conducted at places other than the regular or usual location, within or outside of the county, when it is not prudent, expedient or possible to conduct business at the regular location. When such meetings occur outside of the county, all actions taken by the board of commission shall be as valid and binding as if performed within the county. Such meetings may be called by the presiding officer or any two members of the governing body without regard to or compliance with time-consuming procedures and formalities otherwise required by law. 
                  [Note: Local legislation should be reviewed to determine whether there are restrictions upon moving the meeting location if it is only a locally declared emergency and not a state of emergency declared by the governor.] 
                  (b)  Public works contracts. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or chair of the board of commission, the board of commission may contract for public works without letting such contract out to the lowest, responsible bidder and without advertising and posting notification of such contract for four weeks; provided, however, that the emergency must be of such nature that immediate action is required and that the action is necessary for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. Any public works contract entered into pursuant to this subsection shall be entered on the minutes of the county as soon as practical and the nature of the emergency described therein in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-91-22(e). 
                  (c)  Purchasing. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or chair of the board of commission, the purchasing ordinances, regulations or policies may be suspended. County officials shall continue to seek to obtain the best prices during the state of local emergency. 
                  (d)  Code enforcement. Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or the chair of the board of commission, the board of commission may temporarily suspend the enforcement of the ordinances of the county, or any portion thereof, where the emergency is of such nature that immediate action outside the code is required, such suspension is consistent with the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, and such suspension is not inconsistent with any federal or state statutes or regulations. 
                  (e)  Fees. Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or the chair of the board of commission, the board of commission may temporarily reduce or suspend any permit fees, application fees or other rate structures as necessary to encourage the rebuilding of the areas impacted by the disaster or emergency. The term "fees" include fees or rates charged by the county for building permits, land disturbance permits, zoning applications, special land use permits, temporary land use permits and other fees relating to the reconstruction, repair and clean-up of areas impacted by the disaster or emergency. The term "fees" does not include fees collected by the county on behalf of the state or federal government or fees charged by the county pursuant to a state or federal statute or regulation. 
                  (f)  Temporary dwellings. Upon the declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or chair of the board of commission, the board of commission or its designees may issue temporary mobile home, trailer, recreational vehicle or other temporary dwelling structures or parks in any zoning district, even though not otherwise permitted by Development Code, while the primary dwelling is being repaired, provided that such temporary dwellings or parks are designed by an engineer and the plans are approved by the county health department and development services. The temporary permit shall not exceed six months in duration. In the case of a continuing hardship, and in the discretion of the board of commission or its designee, the permit may be extended for a period of up to an additional six months. Upon expiration of the temporary permit and/or extension, the temporary dwelling must be removed.

                  (a)  In accordance with O.C.G.A. § 38-3-56, before building, constructing, repairing, renovating or making improvements to any real property, including dwellings, homes, buildings, structures or fixtures within an area in the unincorporated area of the county designated in a declared emergency or disaster, any person, firm, partnership, corporation or other entity must register with the Cusseta-Chattahoochee County Development Services Department and secure a building permit that is posted at the work site. Each day any such entity does business in the unincorporated areas of the county without complying with this chapter constitutes a separate offense. 
                  (b)  The cost of registration fees in a declared emergency or disaster is fixed at $_____ per annum. Registration is nontransferable. The cost of the emergency building permit shall be equal to the cost for a building permit under existing regulations. The permit shall only be authorized for repairs. 
                  (c)  When registering, any person, partnership, corporation or other entity making application must, under oath, complete an application, providing the following information:

                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia, O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) and Article I, section 1-104 of the Charter of the Unified Government of Cusseta-Chattahoochee County, Georgia, have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. 
                  (U.G. Ord. No. 2010-2, art. 1, § A, 8-3-2010, eff. 9-17-2010) 
                  Sec. 12-20. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of Cusseta-Chattahoochee County, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (U.G. Ord. No. 2010-2, art. 1, § B, 8-3-2010, eff. 9-17-2010) 
                  Sec. 12-21. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and, 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its flood insurance study (FIS), dated September 17, 2010, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this article. 
                  For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS dated September 17, 2010, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, for Cusseta-Chattahoochee County are hereby adopted by reference. 
                  Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS. 
                  The repository for public inspection of the flood insurance study (FIS), accompanying maps and other supporting data is located in the office of the board of tax assessors.

                  Sec. 12-29. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
                  The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the Unified Government of Cusseta-Chattahoochee County, Georgia, or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

                  Sec. 12-31. - Variance procedures. 
                  (a)  The Board of Commission of the Unified Government of Cusseta-Chattahoochee County, Georgia shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the emergency management director in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of commission may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Chattahoochee County, Georgia, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and, 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The emergency management director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board of commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
                  Flood proofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is:

                  b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property.

                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after January 6, 1988 [the effective date of the initial FIRM] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after February 1, 1977 [the effective date of the FIRST floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after February 1, 1977 [the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA Flood Modernization Maps.

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a 5-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  DIVISION 3. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 12-76. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings: All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 12-77. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 12-76(4), "elevated buildings." 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 12-53(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. section 12-76(6) above) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of section 12-77(3)a., c., above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 12-24, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if section 12-77(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 3. 
                  (U.G. Ord. No. 2010-2, art. 4, § B, 8-3-2010, eff. 9-17-2010)

                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 12-24, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 12-24, then the emergency management director shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 3. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A zone areas where a Limited Detail Study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 12-76(4) "elevated buildings." 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The emergency management director shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Administrative fee means a component of an occupation tax which approximates the reasonable cost of handling and processing the occupation tax. 
                  Dominant line means the type of business, within a multiple-line business, that the greatest amount of income is derived from. 
                  Location or office means and includes any structure or vehicle where a business or occupation is conducted, but shall not include a temporary or construction work site which serves a single customer or project or a vehicle used for sales or delivery by a business or practitioner of a profession or occupation which has a location or office. The renter's or lessee's location which is the site of personal property which is rented or leased from another does not constitute a location or office for the personal property's owner, lessor, or the agent of the owner or lessor. The site of real property which is rented or leased to another does not constitute a location or office for the real property's owner, lessor, or the agent of the owner or lessor unless the real property's owner, lessor, or the agent of the owner or lessor, in addition to showing the property to prospective lessees or tenants and performing maintenance or repair of the property, otherwise conducts the business of renting or leasing the real property at such site or otherwise conducts any other business, profession, or occupation at such site. 
                  Occupation tax means a tax levied on persons, partnerships, corporations or other entities for engaging in an occupation, profession, or business for revenue raising purposes. 
                  Person shall be held to include sole proprietors, corporations, partnerships, nonprofits, or any other form of business organization, but specifically excludes all nonprofit organizations. 
                  Practitioner of profession or occupation means one who by state law requires state licensure regulating such profession or occupation. The term "practitioners of professions or occupations" shall not include a practitioner who is an employee of a business, if the business pays an occupation tax. 
                  Regulatory fees mean payments, whether designated as license fees, permit fees, or by another name, which are required by a local government as an exercise of its police power and as a part of or an aid to regulation of an occupation, profession or business. The amount of a regulatory fee shall approximate the reasonable cost of the actual regulatory activity performed by the county. A regulatory fee may not include an administrative fee. Development impact fees as defined by O.C.G.A. § 36-71-2(8) or other costs or conditions of zoning or land development are not regulatory fees.

                  Based on the experience of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Columbia County, Georgia; Houston County, Georgia, Bryan County, Georgia and Hinesville, Georgia, which experiences the commission believes are relevant to the problems faced by Cusseta-Chattahoochee County, Georgia, the commission takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of the commission that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars"; or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.

                  (U.G. Ord. No. 2010-1, § 2, 4-5-2010) 
                  Sec. 16-21. - Duty of owners and interested parties; public officer designated; enforcement. 
                  (a)  It is the duty of the owner and interested parties of every dwelling, building, structure, or property within the limits of the unified government to construct and maintain their dwellings, buildings, structures, and/or property in conformance with applicable codes in force within the jurisdiction, or such ordinances which regulate and prohibit activities on property and which declare it to be a public nuisance to construct or maintain any dwelling, building, structure, or property in violation of such codes or ordinances. 
                  (b)  The manager of the unified government or her/his designee is the public officer designated and appointed to exercise the powers prescribed by this article, also known herein as "public officer." 
                  (c)  If the public officer determines, under existing ordinances or codes that a dwelling, building or structure is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use, or otherwise finds conditions more fully set out in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-10, then the public officer may exercise all of the powers set out in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-11, and in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(e), all for the purpose of having such citations issued and action taken for the purpose of having such unfit structures repaired, closed or demolished, with these actions to be taken prior to, in lieu of, or in addition to, the complaint in rem provided for herein. In addition, whenever such action is determined necessary by the public officer, or when a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of the unified government charging that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property. If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the owner and parties in interest in such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the owner and parties in interest; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the owner and parties in interest that a hearing will be held before the Magistrate Court of the Unified Government of Cusseta-Chattahoochee County, at a date and time certain and at a place within the unified government. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the magistrate court. The owner and parties in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing. 
                  (d)  If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  (1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this article, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a state appraiser classification as provided in Chapter 39A of Title 43 of the Official Code of Georgia (O.C.G.A. § 43-39A-1 et seq.), qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the unified government. 
                  (e)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (f)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity for public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the unified government are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials; and the amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (g)  The lien provided for in subsection (f) of this section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the Office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Chattahoochee County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(c) which is hereinafter incorporated herein and made a part hereof. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. title 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the unified government. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  (h)  The board of commission, through its public officer or its unified government manager, may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (i)  Service of the complaints and orders provided for herein upon owners and parties in interest shall be in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12. 
                  (j)  Review of the court order shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

                  1.  When a single-family residence or two-family residence (duplex) is to be constructed on a lot that is adjacent to an unpaved alley, the off-street parking provided for that residential structure shall have direct access to a street. This will not, however, prevent a resident from having access to an unpaved alley for occasional vehicle use. 
                  2.  No structure (utility building, garage, storage building, wall, fence, greenhouse, swimming pool, etc.,) or addition to an existing building may be constructed if the structure or addition will impede access between off-street parking spaces and a road.

                  b.  The location, size and shape of existing buildings or structures on the lot make front yard parking impractical or infeasible. Aesthetic consideration shall not be sufficient justification to permit authorization of a driveway that does not meet the requirements of this ordinance.

                  4.  The planning commission shall establish a reasonable time for hearing of any appeals authorized under this section and shall give at least 15 days' notice of such hearing by publishing the time, date, and location of the public hearing within the county's legal organ, and shall give written notice by regular mail to all parties who are involved with the variance request and adjacent property owners.

                  A.  Subgrade construction. The entire surface of the in-place subgrade shall be plowed, harrowed and mixed to a depth of at least six inches. After the material has been thoroughly mixed, the subgrade shall be brought to plan line, graded, and compacted to 100 percent of the maximum laboratory dry density, unless the subgrade is to be stabilized, in which case the density requirement will not apply at this stage; or unless a subsequent contract provides for base construction. In the latter case, mixing will be eliminated and the in-place subgrade will be compacted to 95 percent of the laboratory maximum dry density. 
                  Prior to placing any subsequent layers of base and paving materials, the subgrade shall have sufficient stability to support construction equipment without excessive movement regardless of compaction. Areas of subgrade that are unstable shall be reworked to a moisture content that will provide stability and compaction. 
                  The surface of the completed subgrade shall be bladed to a smooth and uniform texture. The centerline profile shall conform to the established elevations with an acceptable tolerance of ± ½ inch. The acceptable tolerance under a template conforming to the designated cross-section shall be ± ¼ inch.

If the design thickness of the base, sub base or shoulder course is more than six inches, it shall be constructed in two or more courses of approximately equal thickness. With sufficient and suitable equipment, the engineer may allow base material to be placed in lifts up to eight inches. 
                  C.  Compaction. The moisture content of the mixture of materials at the time of compaction shall be uniformly distributed and shall be adequate to allow compaction to the specified density. After the material placed has been shaped to line, grade and cross-section, it shall be rolled until the course has been uniformly compacted to at least 98 percent of the maximum dry density. 
                  The compacted base shall have sufficient stability to support construction equipment without pumping regardless of compaction. If the base material becomes unstable as a result of too much moisture, the base material and the underlying subgrade, if necessary, shall be dried and reworked to a moisture content that will provide stability and compaction. 
                  D.  Tests. AASHTO: T180 Method D.

                  3.  Jacks for forcing the pipe through the roadbed shall have a jacking head constructed in such a manner as to apply uniform pressure around the ring of the pipe. The pipe to be jacked shall be set on guides, braced together, to properly support the section of the pipe and direct it to the proper line and grade. In general, roadbed material shall be excavated just ahead of the pipe, the excavated material removed through the pipe, and the pipe then forced through the roadbed into the excavated space. 
                  4.  The contractor shall furnish for the engineer's approval, a plan showing his proposed method of handling, including the design for the jacking head, jacking support or back stop, arrangement and position of jacks, pipe guides, etc., complete as assembled. If the contractor elects to weld steel pipe or ductile pipe as a casing and carrier, he shall furnish to the stated materials and research engineer in writing an acceptable welding procedure. This will consist of joint details, preheat temperature and electrodes to be used. The use of welded steel pipe as a sanitary sewer carrier will not be permitted. 
                  5.  The diameter of the excavation shall conform to the outside diameter and circumference of the pipe as closely as practicable. Any voids which develop during the installation operation and which are determined by the engineer to be detrimental to the work shall be pressure grouted with an approved mix. 
                  6.  The distance that the excavation extends beyond the end of the pipe will depend upon the character of the excavated material, but shall not exceed two feet in any case. This distance shall be decreased on instructions from the engineer if the character of the material being excavated makes it desirable. 
                  7.  The pipe shall be jacked from the low or downstream end. Variation in the final position of the pipe from the line and grade established by the engineer will be permitted only to the extent of two percent in lateral alignment, and one percent in vertical grade, providing that the final grade of flow line shall be in the direction indicated on the plans. 
                  8.  If the contractor desires, he may use a cutting edge around the head end and extending a short distance beyond the pipe end, with inside angles or lugs to keep the cutting edge from slipping back into the pipe. 
                  9.  When jacking of pipe is begun, the operation shall be carried on without interruption, insofar as practicable, to prevent the pipe from becoming firmly set in the embankment. 
                  10.  Any pipe damaged in jacking operations shall be removed and replaced by the Contractor at his expense. 
                  11.  The pits or trenches excavated to facilitate jacking operations shall be backfilled immediately after the jacking has been completed.

The location of the pit shall meet the approval of the engineer. The holes are to be bored mechanically. The boring may be done using a pilot approximately two inches in diameter which shall be bored the entire length of the installation and shall be checked for line and grade on the opposite end of the bore from the work pit. This pilot hole shall serve as the centerline of the larger diameter hole to be bored. Excavated material will be placed near the top of the working pit and disposed of as required. The use of water or other fluids in connection with the boring operation will be permitted only to the extent necessary to lubricate cuttings. Jetting will not be permitted. 
                  1.  Allowable variation from line and grade shall be as specified under jacking. The diameter of the excavation shall conform to the outside diameter of the pipe as closely as practicable. Any voids which develop during installation operation and are determined by the engineer to be detrimental to the work, shall be pressure grouted with an approved mix.

                  6.01  Description. This work shall consist of placing, mixing, compacting and shaping the top six inches, or to the plan indicated thickness, of the roadbed in both excavation and embankment areas. This work also includes subgrade stabilization, select material subgrade and shoulder stabilization. 
                  6.02  Materials. 
                  A.  Subgrade materials. Unless otherwise noted, the top six inches (or specified depth) of the subgrade shall conform to Class I or II materials as defined in section 20. 
                  6.03  Construction. 
                  A.  Subgrade construction. The entire surface of the in-place subgrade shall be plowed, harrowed and mixed to a depth of at least six inches. After the material has been thoroughly mixed, the subgrade shall be brought to plan line and grade and compacted to 100 percent of the maximum laboratory dry density unless the subgrade is to be stabilized, in which case the density requirement will not apply at this stage; or unless a subsequent Contract provides for base construction. In the latter case, mixing will be eliminated and the in-place subgrade compacted to 95 percent of the laboratory maximum dry density. 
                  Prior to placing any subsequent layers of base and paving materials, the subgrade shall have sufficient stability to support construction equipment without excessive movement regardless of compaction. Areas of subgrade that are unstable shall be reworked to a moisture content that will provide stability and compaction. 
                  The surface of the completed Subgrade shall be bladed to a smooth and uniform texture. The centerline profile shall conform to the established elevations with an acceptable tolerance of +- 1/2 inch. The acceptable tolerance under a template conforming to the designated cross-section shall be +- 1/4 inch. 
                  The maximum dry density and the test methods shall be in accordance with section 6.03 A. 
                  Sec. 7. - Graded aggregate base.

This work shall consist of constructing a base, subbase or shoulder course composed of mineral aggregates as a prepared subgrade or subbase in accordance with these specifications and in reasonably close conformity with the lines, grades, thicknesses and typical cross-sections shown on the plans or established by the engineer. 
                  7.02  Materials. The materials to be used and the specifications for them are listed below: 
                  Graded aggregate: The graded aggregate base, subbase or shoulder course material shall be of uniform quality throughout. 
                  The graded aggregate may be produced from an approved source or deposit which will yield a satisfactory mixture conforming to all requirements of these specifications after it has been crushed or processed as part of the mining operations, or the material may be furnished in two sizes of such gradation that when combined in the central mix plan the resultant mixture shall conform to the required specifications. In addition, the material passing the No. 10 sieve shall be relatively free of detrimental substances such as soil overburden, decomposed rock and/or swelling silts. 
                  Graded aggregate base, subbase, or shoulder material shall conform to the following: 
                  GRADATION OF GRADED AGGREGATE 

                   
                  Method tests shall be in accordance with the following:

                  B.  Thickness of course. The maximum thickness to be laid in one course shall be six inches compacted. If the design thickness of the base, subbase or shoulder course is more than six inches, it shall be constructed in two or more courses of approximately equal thickness. With a sufficient and suitable equipment, the engineer may allow base material to be placed in lifts up to eight inches. 
                  C.  Compacting and finishing. 
                  1.  Compaction. The moisture content of the mixture of materials at the time of compaction shall be uniformly distributed and shall be adequate to allow compaction to the specified density. After the material placed has been shaped to line, grade and cross-section, it shall be rolled until the course has been uniformly compacted to at least 98 percent of the maximum dry density. 
                  The compacted base shall have sufficient stability to support construction equipment without pumping irregardless of compaction. If the base material becomes unstable as a result of too much moisture, the base material and the underlying subgrade, if necessary, shall be dried and reworked to a moisture content that will provide stability and compaction.

Where sidewalks abut curb and gutter, alternate joins shall coincide. All edges shall be rounded with a one-fourth inch edger. Expansion joints shall be of the materials, dimensions, and at locations specified on the plans. 
                  d.  Concrete curbs, gutters and medians. 
                  1.  Contraction joints. Adjacent to concrete paving, the spacing of joints in curb and gutters and medians shall be arranged to coincide with the joint spacing in paving. Joints may be formed by metal divider plates or sawed. The depth of the joint shall be not less than one-fifth nor more than one-fourth the depth of the concrete. With the exception of sawed joints, all joints shall be finished with a one-fourth inch edging tool. For curbs, gutters and medians adjacent to pavement other than concrete, contraction joints shall be as follows: 
                  a.  For header curb and combination curb and gutter: Install a contraction joint at a maximum spacing of 20 feet. 
                  b.  For gutter and median: Install a contraction joint at a maximum spacing of 20 feet. 
                  2.  Expansion joints. Expansion joints shall be formed in accordance with plan details or as directed.
