PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Gilmer County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Senior Code Attorney, and William B. Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

The resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds and such trust agreements or indenture may contain provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders, including the right of appointment of a receiver upon default of the payment of any principal or interest obligation and the right of any receiver or trustee to enforce collection of any rents, fees, charges, or revenues for use of the project or projects necessary to pay all costs of operation and all reserves provided for, all principal and interest on all bonds of the issue, all costs of collection, and all other costs reasonably necessary to accomplish the collection of such sums in the event of any default of the authority. Such resolution and such trust agreement or indenture may include covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property for and construction of the project and to the custody, safeguarding, and application of all funds and covenants providing for the operation, maintenance, repair, and insurance of the project or projects and may contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. Such trust agreement or indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in securing bonds and debentures of corporations and may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such trust.

                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of the ordinance or resolution sections inserted in the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
                  Sec. 1-14. - Effective date of ordinances and resolutions.

                  Sec. 2-112. - Scope. 
                  The provisions of this code of ethics shall be applicable to county officials. 
                  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, state law shall be controlling in the event of an actual conflict with the provisions of this code of ethics. This ordinance shall be interpreted to supplement, and not replace, said provisions of state law.

                  Sec. 2-113. - Definitions. 
                  Solely for the purpose of this code of ethics: 
                  County official or official, unless otherwise expressly defined, means the chairman and commissioners of the board of commissioners. The terms "county official" or "official" also include all individuals appointed by the chairman of the board of commissioners and/or board of commissioners as appropriate to county boards, commissions, and authorities, or other bodies which can or may vote or take formal action or make official recommendations to the board of commissioners. The terms do not include other county elected officials, county employees, the county attorney, the executive assistant to the board of commissioners, the comptroller, or department heads or chief executive officers, by whatever names designated, of the various departments of the county. 
                  Decision means any ordinance, resolution, contract, franchise, formal action or other matter voted on by the board of commissioners or other county board, commission, or authority, as well as the discussions or deliberations of a county board, commission, or authority which can or may lead to a vote or formal action by that body. 
                  Employee means any person who is a full-time or part-time employee of the county. 
                  Immediate family means the spouse, mother, father, grandparent, brother, sister, son or daughter of any county official related by blood, adoption or marriage. The relationship by marriage shall include in-laws. An "in-law" is the sibling of one's spouse, but extends no further.

                  Remote interest means an interest of a person or entity, including a county official, which would be affected in the same way as the general public. For example, the interest of an official in the property tax rate, general county fees, county utility charges or a comprehensive zoning ordinance or similar matters is deemed remote to the extent that the official would be affected in common with the general public. 
                  Substantial interest means an interest, either directly or through a member of the immediate family, in another person or entity, where: 
                  (1)  The interest is ownership of five percent or more of the voting stock, shares or equity of the entity or ownership of $5,000.00 or more of the equity or market value of the entity; or 
                  (2)  The funds received by the person from the other person or entity during the previous 12 months that either equal or exceed: 
                  a.  Five thousand dollars in salary, bonuses, commissions or professional fees, or $5,000.00 in payment for goods, products or services; or 
                  b.  Ten percent of the recipient's gross income during that period, whichever is less; 
                  (3)  The person serves as a corporate officer or member of the board of directors or other governing board of a for-profit entity other than a corporate entity owned or created by the board of commissioners; or 
                  (4)  The person is a creditor, debtor, or guarantor of the other person or entity in an amount of $5,000.00 or more.

Any official who has a proprietary interest in an agency doing business with the county shall make that interest known in writing to the board of commissioner via the clerk of the board of commissioners. 
                  (f)  All public funds shall be used for the general welfare of the people and not for personal economic gain.

                  (l)  A county official shall not directly or indirectly make use of, or permit others to make use of, official information not made available to the general public for the purpose of furthering a private interest. 
                  (m)  A county official shall not use his or her position in any way to coerce, or give the appearance of coercing, another person to provide any financial benefit to such official or persons within the official's immediate family, or those with whom the official has business or financial ties amounting to a substantial interest. 
                  (n)  A county official shall not order any goods and services for the county without prior official authorization for such expenditure. No county official shall attempt to obligate the county nor give the impression of obligating the county without proper prior authorization.

                  Sec. 6-31. - Introduction. 
                  (a)  The county's population has grown substantially in recent years. With the increase in population has come a drastic and dramatic increase in the volume of traffic in the county. Uniform regulation of signage providing directional, commercial, and noncommercial information to the motoring public, to promote public safety, is essential. 
                  (b)  Various and diverse businesses are located within the county. The need to advertise products and services must be balanced by the county's obligation to restrict clutter, maintain an aesthetically pleasing environment, protect property values, and enhance public safety. 
                  (c)  Regulation of the location, size, placement, and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services, and facilities in the county without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the community, to take advantage of the beauty of the community's natural environment, and to protect property values of the community. Such regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of businesses in the county in the event of police, fire, or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies.

                  (2)  A sign is by its very nature designed to draw an individual's attention to that sign. This characteristic makes signs a valuable medium of communication; however this same characteristic can distract motorists and pedestrians thus creating traffic hazards. 
                  (3)  The clutter created by excess in number, size and height of signs creates a distraction to travelers and negatively impacts the general appearance of an area. Signs may lessen the aesthetic qualities of an area and intrude upon the residential character of an area. 
                  (4)  Signs must be regulated to insure that they are structurally safe and sound and for those signs illuminated electrical hazards are eliminated. 
                  (5)  Proper regulation is necessary to limit the negative impact of signs while encouraging the positive and constructive uses of signs. 
                  (6)  Signs enhance the economy and the business and industry of the county by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs. 
                  (7)  Signs, which are compatible with their surroundings, will be promoted. 
                  (b)  It is also the purpose of this article to insure proper maintenance, for safety and structural soundness, as well as the appearance and attractiveness of signs.

                  Sec. 6-37. - Intention. 
                  By enacting this article, the board of commissioners intends to: 
                  (1)  Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
                  (2)  Protect the public health, safety, and welfare; 
                  (3)  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; 
                  (4)  Maintain the rural scenic mountain image of the county; 
                  (5)  Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
                  (6)  Promote economic development; and 
                  (7)  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulation.

               <head>Chapter 24 - ALARM SYSTEMS </head>
               <p>
                  Sec. 24-1. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this article is to encourage alarm users and alarm companies to properly use and maintain alarm systems and to reduce or eliminate false alarms, which unduly divert law enforcement from responding to actual criminal activity. This article governs systems intended to summon law enforcement response, requires registration, establishes fees, provides for penalties for violations, establishes a system of administration and sets conditions for revocation of registration. 
                  (Res. No. 16-153, 11-10-2016) 
                  Sec. 24-2. - Definitions. 
                  As used in this subchapter, the following words shall have the meaning ascribed thereto: 
                  Alarm signal: A detectible signal, either audible or visual, generated by an alarm system, to which the county sheriff's department, and/or the county fire department is expected to respond. 
                  Alarm system: Any device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the occurrence of an illegal entry or other event requiring immediate attention and to which the county sheriff's department, and/or the county fire department is expected to respond, but does not include alarms installed in motor vehicles or fire alarms. 
                  Alarm systems coordinator: An employee of the county designated by the board of commissioners to administer this subchapter. 
                  Alarm user: 
                  (1)  The owner and/or resident of any residence in which a household alarm system has been activated; 
                  (2)  In the case of a commercial business, any manager or operator of a facility in which a commercial alarm system has been activated; or 
                  (3)  Any person(s) registered with the county as a user of an alarm system. 
                  Calendar year: For purposes of this code section, calendar year shall be defined as beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31 of each year. 
                  Commercial alarm system: Any device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the occurrence of an illegal entry or other event, including fire, at a commercial business or premises requiring immediate attention and to which the county sheriff's department and/or the county fire department is expected to respond. Apartment complexes shall be considered as commercial premises. 
                  False alarm: The activation of an alarm system through mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the alarm user, his employees or agents, and signals activated to summon law enforcement or emergency personnel unless response was canceled by the alarm user or his agent before personnel are dispatched to the alarm location. A false alarm shall not include an alarm which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated for the first time by unusual conditions of nature nor does it include other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to the control of the alarm user. In addition, an alarm activated during an alarm system testing procedure shall not be considered a false alarm if the alarm user first notifies and receives permission from the alarm systems coordinator to test the system. An alarm is false within the meaning of this subchapter when, upon investigation or inspection by county employees, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, burglary, robbery, or other such crime was committed or attempted and no fire or other emergency existed in or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system. 
                  Household alarm system: Any device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the occurrence of an illegal entry or other event at a residential address or premises requiring immediate attention and to which the county sheriff's department and/or the county fire department is expected to respond, but does not include alarms installed in motor vehicles or fire alarms.

                  Sec. 24-6. - Government immunity. 
                  Registration of an alarm system is not intended to, nor does it, create a contract, duty or obligation, either expressed or implied, of response by a law enforcement agency.

                  (b)  Notification. If the county employee at the scene of the activated alarm system determines the alarm to be false, he shall make a report of the false alarm. The alarm user and alarm systems coordinator shall be supplied with copies of each false alarm determination report.

                  Sec. 24-8. - Review of false alarm determinations.

                  Sec. 62-161. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The agricultural district is established to encourage the retention and development of suitable areas for common farm practices and various non-farm uses, preservation of open space, the conservation and management of soil, water, air, game and other natural resources and amenities, and to discourage the creation or continuation of conditions which could detract from the function, operation, and appearance of areas to provide food supplies and to prevent or minimize conflicts between common farm practices and non-farm uses. Gilmer County adopts and follows O.C.G.A. § 41-1-7 sets forth, "A farm or farming operation shall not be found to be a public or private nuisance if the farm or farm operation alleged to be a nuisance conforms to generally accepted agricultural and management practices." All applicable agricultural uses are required to practice and implement identified best management practices.

                  The public institutional (PI) zoning district is established to ensure that the public, quasi-public, and institutional use of property is related to the purposes and policies of the general plan and the public/quasi-public land use classification contained in the general plan; to recognize the public, quasi-public, and institutional nature of particular parcels of land and provide standards and guidelines for their continued use and future development; and to ensure that the public, quasi-public, and institutional structures and developments in the district will be compatible with surrounding districts and uses. 
                  The requirements of the PI zoning district are intended to apply to publicly owned property, property owned by quasi-public or public service entities, and property used or planned to be used for certain institutional facilities

                  Sec. 62-230. - Established. 
                  A board of land use appeals ("BOLUA") is hereby established. The BOLUA shall perform all of its duties and exercise all of its powers in such a way that the purpose and intent of the land use ordinance shall be accomplished, public health, safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. The BOLUA provides a mechanism for relief in individual cases where certain dimensional requirements of this code pose undue hardship, provides for appeals from the administration, interpretation, or enforcement of this code. The grant of authority to the BOLUA is limited to the provisions herein and shall be sparingly used by the BOLUA upon showing of just cause.

                  Sec. 62-231. - Creation, purpose, and appointment. 
                  The BOLUA shall be appointed by the board of commissioner and shall be composed of five members at pleasure and who shall serve without compensation. Upon initial appointment, two members shall be appointed for three years, two members for two years, and one member for one year, and thereafter terms shall be three years each. If any vacancy should occur in the membership of the board for any cause, the commissioners shall fill such vacancy by making an appointment for the unexpired term. A majority of members present shall be required to constitute a quorum.

                  Sec. 62-232. - Meetings and records. 
                  The BOLUA shall adopt internal bylaws to establish rules of procedure as are necessary to carry out the purposes of its authority. Such bylaws shall prescribe the annual election of a chairman, vice-chairman, and secretary. 
                  The board may appoint a secretary to keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the action of each board member upon each question, or if a member is absent or fails to vote, indicating such fact. Such records shall be public record and available to the public in accordance with the Georgia Open Records Act. The BOLUA shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses, administer oaths, compel testimony and the production of books, papers, files and other evidence pertinent to the matters before it. On all appeals, applications and matters before the BOLUA, said BOLUA shall inform in writing all parties involved in its decision. 
                  The board shall establish a regular meeting date and time for its monthly meetings, however, meetings shall be held on an as-needed basis or at the call of the chairman. All meetings shall be open to the public. The board may adjourn any public hearing or meeting in order to obtain additional information or to serve further notice upon such other property owners as it decides may be interested in the application or appeal. Such adjournment shall also require the board to declare the timely rescheduling of the business at hand.

                  Sec. 62-233. - Public hearings and notice required. 
                  All decisions or actions issued by the BOLUA shall only occur after conducting a legally advertised public hearing. Such public hearing shall require a minimum of 15 days' notice of the date, place, time, and purpose of the meeting, which shall be published in the newspaper of general circulation in Gilmer County, Georgia and a sign shall be posted on the property affected, if applicable, also identifying the date, place, time, and purpose of the meeting. Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person or by power-of-attorney, or by attorney, or both.

                  Sec. 62-234. - Powers and duties limited. 
                  The BOLUA is a body of limited powers, and its actions are taken in a quasi-judicial capacity rather than a legislative capacity. The BOLUA is empowered to hear and decide administrative appeals where it is alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the LDO, building official, or other employee in the interpretation or enforcement of this land use ordinance. The BOLUA is empowered to hear and decide variances to the terms of this article or special exceptions as may be authorized by this article. 
                  The BOLUA is empowered to hear, after proper filing of an application specifying the action or order being appealed and the grounds for the appeal to be heard, any person, firm, or corporation, or by any officer, department, board, or bureau affected by any decisions of the LDO, building official or other employee based on this land use ordinance. Such application shall be taken within 30 days after the action or order being appealed by filing with the LDO a notice of appeal. All papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken shall be transmitted to the BOLUA. A fee shall also be required with the application to cover the advertising costs. 
                  An application for decision on an issue stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the land development officer certifies to the BOLUA after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him/her, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his/her opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such cases, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by a court of record on application, on notice to the land development officer, and on due cause shown. 
                  In exercising its powers, the BOLUA may, in conformity with the provisions of this article, reverse, affirm or modify its prior order, requirement, decision or determination, in whole or in part, and to that end shall have all of the powers of the LDO and/or his/her appointee or representative and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit. The BOLUA may attach any conditions to its approval which it finds necessary to accomplish the reasonable application of the requirements of this article. In cases where an issue is granted, the board shall have all necessary powers of the land development officer and may issue permits, or direct the issuance of permits, not otherwise inconsistent with this code and any other code, resolution, or ordinance adopted by the Gilmer County Board of Commissioners. 
                  The BOLUA's secretary shall notify the applicant, in writing, of the board's final decision upon the matter that was the subject of filed application. 
                  (1)  Administrative appeals. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination by the land development officer or appointee in the enforcement of this article. Such appeals may include, but are not limited to: 1) zone district boundary interpretations beyond the provisions of section 62-74; 2) interpretation of uses as provided in division 12; 3) interpretations relating to the existence of a nonconforming use, when applicable. 
                  (2)  Variances. The BOLUA is hereby empowered to authorize upon application in specific cases such variances as defined herein as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this article will in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this article shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. A variance may be granted upon specific findings that all of the following conditions exist. The absence of any one of the conditions shall be grounds for denial of the application for variance. Further, a variance cannot be granted for a use of land, building, or structure that is prohibited in a district by this article, nor can a variance be granted to allow an increase in the number of dwelling units per acre or a lot size smaller than authorized by this article. The minimum allowable variance for a setback shall be no less than five feet from a property line. 
                  a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other land or structures in the same district; and 
                  b.  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this land use ordinance would create an unnecessary hardship and would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other property owners within the district in which the property is located; and 
                  c.  Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privilege that is denied to other properties of the district in which the applicant's property is located; and 
                  d.  Relief, if granted, will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this article and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or general welfare in such a manner as will interfere with or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings or unreasonably affect their value; and 
                  e.  The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant; and 
                  f.  The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building, or structure. 
                  (3)  Special exceptions. To include decisions or actions, now or upon future amendment of this article, whereby the board of land use appeals is empowered to make such decisions or take such actions.

                  No order of the BOLUA permitting the erection or alteration of a building or other variance shall be valid for a period of longer than 12 months unless such use is established within such period; provided, however that such order by the BOLUA shall continue in force and effect if a building permit for said erection or alteration is obtained within such period, and such erection or alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with, and within the time prescribed by such permit.

Failure of the land development officer or his/her appointee to collect a fee from the Gilmer County Board of Commissioners, when the board is initiating a proposed land use amendment, shall not void the validity of the application.

Specifically, land shall not be cleared, graded, altered, filled, or manipulated unless such land alteration is for the purpose of establishing a use allowed by the district where the site is located.

                  I acknowledge that I have read and understand the following notice prescribed in O.C.G.A. 44-1-17. 
                  "It is the policy of this state and this community to conserve, protect, and encourage the development and improvement of farm and forest land for the production of food, fiber, and other products, and also for its natural and environmental value. This notice is to inform prospective property owners or other persons or entities leasing or acquiring an interest in real property that the property in which they are about to acquire an interest lies within, or adjacent to an area zoned, used or identified for farm and forest activities and that farm and forest activities occur in the area. Such farm and forest activities may include intensive operations that cause discomfort and inconveniences that involve, but are not limited to, noises, odors, fumes, dust, smoke, insects, operations of machinery during any 24 hour period, storage and disposal of manure, and the application by spraying or otherwise of chemical fertilizers, soil amendments, herbicides, and pesticides. Ore or more of these inconveniences may occur as the result of farm or forest activities which are in conformance with existing laws and regulations and accepted customs and standards." 
                  I recognize that I may be subject to inconvenience or discomfort from lawful agricultural operations. Discomfort and inconvenience may include, but are not limited to, noise, odors, fumes, dust, smoke, burning, vibrations, insects, rodents, and/or the operation of machinery (including aircraft) during any 24 hour period.

My signature below constitutes a voluntary acknowledgement of the forgoing and I will not bring any complaints against adjacent landowners whose property is agricultural land or in agricultural operation, or against local government(s), asserting that the adjacent agricultural operation or uses of agricultural lands constitute a nuisance.

As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the Director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsection (c)(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2); 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection (c)(16) and (17), there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed ; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single—family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to section 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to section 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this subsection maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single—family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection (b) and (c). 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

                  Sec. 70-34. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the county without first obtaining a permit from the land development office to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the Limestone Valley Soil and Water Conservation District and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c). Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 70-33(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to subsection O.C.G.A. 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to subsection O.C.G.A. 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section (c)(15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 70-33(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 70-33(c)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(f)(1).

                  Sec. 70-35. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The land development officer will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The land development officer shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to section 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and; 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 70-34(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. 
                  (1)  Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  ARTICLE III. - MOUNTAIN PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 70-70. - Findings of fact. 
                  The mountains of the state are characterized by steep slopes, thin soils, and, because of the natural stresses placed on such environments, they require special protection. Land disturbing activity on the high elevation, steep slope mountains of the state potentially threatens the public health, safety, welfare, and economic progress of the state. Such land disturbing activity: 
                  (1)  May endanger the quality of surface water by increasing erosion and stream sedimentation; 
                  (2)  Has the potential to induce landslides; 
                  (3)  Has the potential to adversely affect groundwater due to the difficulty in providing proper sewage disposal in areas of steep slope and high elevation; 
                  (4)  May damage the habitat for some species of wildlife (both plants and animals); and 
                  (5)  May detract from the mountains' scenic and natural beauty which is vital to the recreation and tourism industry of North Georgia.

                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is;

                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after October 10, 1989 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after October 10, 1989 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after October 10, 1989. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA Flood Modernization Maps.

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are NOT exempt from any ordinance requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  In ALL areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements—Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than two foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 74-81(4), "elevated buildings". 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above two foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction—New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to two foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 74-63(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles—Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than two foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  (i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than two foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  (ii)  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. section 74-81(6) above) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  (i)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  (ii)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  (iii)  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)a through (3)c, above. 
                  (4)  Floodway—Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 74-36, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  ONLY if subsection (4)a above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 2.

                  The plat approval process is a three-step process. The process is designed to provide a logical sequence of reviews and events in the subdivision development process. The plat approval process is as follows: 
                  Major subdivision 
                  (1)  Preliminary plat and design plans. The process begins with the preparation of a preliminary plat and, if appropriate, supporting design plans of the proposed development by a surveyor and/or a qualified design professional, duly licensed in Georgia. The preliminary plat and design plans shall contain the information outlined in section 82-62 and be reviewed and approved as outlined in section 82-63. A county application form shall accompany the preliminary plat and design plans when submitted. 
                  (2)  Construction of improvements. The second step in the subdivision process shall be the construction of the necessary improvements to the subdivision (i.e., streets, lot corner stakes, monuments, drainage and water system, if applicable). The improvements shall closely approximate the plan approved on the preliminary plat. 
                  Note: No lot shall be conveyed in any subdivision until such time as the final plat has been recorded. 
                  The developer may choose to exercise the provisions of article IX of this chapter in the second step of the review process. 
                  (3)  Final plat. Upon the completion of the necessary improvements, or following the provisions contained in article IX of this chapter, the developer shall provide a final plat which will serve as an as-built drawing for the subdivision. The final plat shall contain the information outlined in section 82-92 and be reviewed and approved as outlined in section 82-93. Upon obtaining approval of the final plat, the developer shall be authorized to record the plat in the county office of the clerk of superior court. A county application form shall accompany the final plat when submitted.

                  (2)  That, in the case of failure on the part of the developer to complete the specified improvements within the required time period, the creditor shall pay to the county immediately, and without further action, such funds as are necessary to finance the completion of those improvements up to the limit of credit stated in the letter. 
                  (3)  That the letter of credit may not be withdrawn, or reduced in amount, until released by the county.

                  (a)  Finding of fact. River corridors are the strips of land that flank major rivers in the state. These corridors are of vital importance to the state in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The Coosawattee River has been designated as a protected river by the state. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to guide future growth and development in the areas adjacent to the Coosawattee River as defined in this article. 
                  (c)  Authority. This article is enacted pursuant to the authority contained in Ga. Const. art. IX, § II, ¶ I, and art. IX, § II, ¶ III, and O.C.G.A. §§ 12-2-8(b), 50-8-2(a)(18)(B) and 50-8-7.1(b). 
                  (d)  Jurisdiction. This article shall apply to the unincorporated areas of the county and to any incorporated area electing to adopt this article. 
                  (e)  Interpretation. This article shall be interpreted in conjunction with federal, and state rules, regulations and laws, and other county ordinances contained or referenced in this article. 
                  (Ord. of 9-23-1999, § I) 
                  Sec. 86-32. - Definitions.

(Note: This is same definition as used in the Georgia Hazardous Waste Management Acts, O.C.G.A. § 12-8-60 et seq.) 
                  Land disturbing activity means any grading, scraping, excavating, or filling of land; clearing of vegetation; and any construction, rebuilding, or alteration of a structure. The term "land disturbing activity" shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, individual home gardens, yard and grounds upkeep, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single-family dwelling, and the cutting of firewood for personal use. 
                  Natural vegetative buffer and buffer area mean a river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, "the Natural Environments of Georgia." Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species. 
                  Perennial river means a river or section of a river that flows continuously throughout the year. 
                  Protected river means any perennial stream or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second as determined by appropriate U.S. Geological Survey documents. However, those segments of river covered by the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq.) or the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act are specifically excluded from the definition of a protected river. In coastal areas, the seaward limit of any protected river shall be the inland limits of the jurisdiction of the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970 (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-280 et seq.). 
                  Public utility or utilities means a service or services provided by a public utility company or a private entity which provides such service or services and all equipment and structures necessary to provide such services. 
                  River bank means the rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
                  River corridor means all land not regulated under O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-440—12-5-457, and the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970 (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-280 et seq.) in the areas of a perennial stream or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second as defined by the United States Geologic Survey and being within 100 feet on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks at mean high water. The 100-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the river banks, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured 100-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by the local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the river corridor protection district. Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purposes of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for the county joint comprehensive plan. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the review period will be shown by revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next comprehensive plan review by the state department of community affairs. 
                  Sensitive natural area means any area, as identified now or hereafter by the state department of natural resources, which contains one or more of the following: 
                  (1)  Habitat, including nesting sites, occupied by rare or endangered species; 
                  (2)  Rare or exemplary natural communities; 
                  (3)  Significant landforms, hydroforms, or geological features; or 
                  (4)  Other areas so designated by the state department of natural resources; and which are sensitive or vulnerable to physical or biological alteration. 
                  Single-family dwelling means a dwelling structure that is designed for the use of one family. 
                  Written notification means a notice to applicant given in writing and mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known mailing address submitted by applicant to the land development officer. Notice as to the land development officer shall be given in writing and mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, or delivered personally to and a receipt obtained from the land development officer.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 86-61. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. The wetlands in the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. The wetlands in the county provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well being of many communities within the state. Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. 
                  (c)  Authority. This article is enacted pursuant to the authority contained in Ga. Const. art. IX, § II, ¶ I, and art. IX, § II, ¶ III, and O.C.G.A. §§ 12-2-8(b), 50-8-2(a)(18)(B) and 50-8-7.1(b). 
                  (d)  Jurisdiction. This article shall apply to the unincorporated areas of the county and to any incorporated area electing to adopt this article. 
                  (e)  Interpretation. This article shall be interpreted in conjunction with federal, and state rules, regulations and laws, and other county ordinances contained or referenced in this article.

                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Generalized wetlands map means the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps for the county. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland means an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended. 
                  Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
                  Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. 
                  Written notification. means the notice as to applicant shall be given in writing and mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known mailing address submitted by applicant to the land development officer. Notice as to the land development officer shall be given in writing and mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, or delivered personally to and a receipt obtained from the land development officer.

                  (a)  The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the county that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto. 
                  (b)  The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.

                  Sec. 86-64. - Protection criteria requirement for local permit or permission. 
                  No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the land development office. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the land development officer using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a Section 404 Permit or letter of permission is issued.

                  Sec. 86-131. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the county and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surface can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the county; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the county. 
                  (c)  Authority. This article is enacted pursuant to the authority contained in Ga. Const. art. IX, § II, ¶ I, and art. IX, § II, ¶ III, and O.C.G.A. §§ 12-2-8(b), 50-8-2(a)(18)(B) and 50-8-7.1(b). 
                  (d)  Jurisdiction. This article shall apply to the unincorporated areas of the county and to any incorporated area electing to adopt this article. 
                  (e)  Interpretation. This article shall be interpreted in conjunction with federal and state rules, regulations and laws, and other county ordinances contained or referenced in this article.
