PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Richmond Hill, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This republication was under the direct supervision of Brian C. Taylor, Supervising Editor, and Aline L. True, Accuracy Management Director, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Ursula Lee, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this republication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits."

The authority shall not be a state institution, nor a department or agency of the state, but shall be an instrumentality of the state, a mere creation of the state, having a distinct corporate entity and being exempt from the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 50-17-20 et seq., the "Georgia State Financing and Investment Commission Act." The authority shall have its principal office in Bryan County, and its legal situs or residence for the purposes of this Act shall be Bryan County.

               (b)  The authority shall consist of seven members who shall be residents of the City of Richmond Hill and who shall be appointed by the mayor and council of the City of Richmond Hill.

               (e)  Any vacancy on the authority shall be filled in the same manner as was the original appointment of the member whose termination of membership resulted in such vacancy and the person so selected and appointed shall serve for the remainder of the unexpired term. 
               (f)  The authority shall elect one of its members as chairperson and another member as vice chairperson. The city clerk of the City of Richmond Hill shall be the secretary and treasurer. Said city clerk shall not be a member of the authority. 
               (g)  Four members of the authority shall constitute a quorum. No vacancy on the authority shall impair the right of the quorum to exercise all the rights and perform all the duties of the authority. 
               (h)  The members of the authority shall be reimbursed for all actual expenses incurred in the performance of their duties out of funds of the authority. 
               (i)  The authority shall make rules and regulations for its own government. It shall have perpetual existence. 
               (j)  Any member of the authority may be removed from office by the governing authority which appointed such member for failure to perform his duties as a member of the authority. Such failure shall include without limitation the failure to attend a majority of the regularly scheduled meetings in a calendar year.

               The authority, or any authority or body which has or which may in the future succeed to the powers, duties, and liabilities vested in the authority created by this Act, shall have power and is authorized at one time or from time to time to provide by resolution for the issuance of negotiable revenue bonds for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost as defined in this Act of any one or more projects. The principal of and interest on such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund provided for in this Act for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated and shall bear interest at such rate or rates as determined by the authority, payable on such dates as determined by the authority. Principal on such bonds shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their date or dates, shall be payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity at the option of the authority at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority in the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds.

The authority may be sued the same as private corporations on any contractual obligation of the authority.

The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action the State of Georgia or any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality of the State of Georgia or the United States government or any department or agency of the United States government, if subject to being sued and if consenting to same, which has contracted with the authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated and the state or such municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts adjudicated as part of the basis of the security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds when validated, and the judgment of validation, shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon and against the authority issuing the same, the state and any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision, or instrumentality, if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the authority. 
               Section 16. - Status of outstanding bonds. 
               While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of said authority or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency, or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds and upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions of this Act shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.

                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code, but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code. 
                  Sec. 1-10. - Altering Code.

                  Sec. 2-1 - [Management of public records.] 
                  (a)  Purpose. The city council of the City of Richmond Hill hereby ordains, in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 50-18-99, that all records created or received in the performance of a public duty or paid for by public funds by the governing body are deemed to be public property and shall constitute a record of public acts. As certain records are essential for varying lengths of time for conducting business, the continuity of government, the protection of the rights and privileges of its citizens, and as documentary evidence of our heritage, the City of Richmond Hill resolves to implement a records management program. 
                  Except as otherwise provided by law, ordinance, or policy adopted by the governing body, all records shall be open to the public or the state or any agency thereof (O.C.G.A. § 50-18-99(g)). 
                  (b)  Appointment of records management clerk. The council/city manager/city clerk shall designate an employee to coordinate and perform the responsibilities of records management. This employee shall work with each department to develop and administer a records management program for all records and media types. 
                  (c)  Designation of official record format. Electronically generated materials (such as email, electronic data interchange and other forms of electronic materials) are recognized as a standard format for official public records. The city shall formally designate the authorized formats for official records. Digital data, as with any form of official record, shall be safeguarded against loss, unauthorized destruction or modification, and shall be included in data security and records management policy and procedures. 
                  (d)  Adoption of statewide records retention schedules. The City of Richmond Hill officially recognizes and adopts the records retention schedule approved by the state records committee and the Georgia Archives and set forth by the Georgia Records Act (O.C.G.A. § 50-18-94(6)). No public records shall be disposed of, destroyed or given away except in accordance with this schedule. 
                  (e)  Ownership of records remains with department of origination. Ownership of any record shall be vested and remain in the office or department of origination. The records management clerk shall not destroy any record without consulting with the proper personnel and receiving a directive requesting such destruction.

                  (2)  The city's interest is unrelated to the suppression of nude dancing per se; and

                  (a)  Based on the experiences, studies and findings of other municipalities and urban counties, including without limitation College Park, Georgia; Richmond County, Georgia; Atlanta, Georgia; and Savannah, Georgia; all of which are relevant to the problems and conditions that could prevail in this city, the mayor and councilmembers find that live, public human nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly in circumstances related to the sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages, tends to beget criminal behavior and to create undesirable community conditions. 
                  (b)  Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are prostitution, violent and sex-related offenses, drug trafficking and use, illegal dispensing of alcoholic beverages, and disorderly conduct. 
                  (c)  Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. 
                  (d)  In the interest of public health, safety and welfare, the limitation of nudity and sex-related conduct in establishments holding an alcoholic beverage license is a matter of governmental interest and concern because it will discourage and reduce the criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with alcoholic beverage license-holding establishments that allow and/or encourage nudity or sex-related conduct. The sale or use of alcohol is prohibited in any such establishment.

                  Sec. 18-111. - Hearing issues and relief. 
                  If after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  (1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  The court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a state appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. tit. 41, ch. 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the city. 
                  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved, or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such abatement action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or by any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer, the city council and all officials of the city, and the city are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the city, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (Ord. of 3-4-08, § 11) 
                  Sec. 18-112. - Lien collection procedures. 
                  The lien provided for in section 18-111, supra, shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure or demolition in the office of the clerk of county superior court and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required by section 18-109, supra. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. 
                  Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this section, the public officer taking the action shall transmit to the city manager, or his or her designee, a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition or closure. It shall be the duty of the city manager, or his or her designee, to collect the amount of the lien, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78, which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure, shall not apply. The city manager, or his or her designee, shall remit the amount to the general fund of the city. 
                  Enforcement of liens pursuant to this section may be initiated at any time following receipt by the city manager, or his or her designee, of the final determination of costs in accordance with this section. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this section. 
                  The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this section shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this section, together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the city in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81.

                  Where the abatement action does not commence in superior court, review of the court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement or demolition of a dwelling, building or structure shall be by direct appeal to the county superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

                  (1)  The owner must apply for a secured building/structure permit and pay the required fees, and the public officer shall then inspect such structure; 
                  (2)  To qualify for secured building status, the building must be structurally sound (walls and roof); otherwise, the secured building permit will be denied; 
                  (3)  If the building is structurally sound, nonstructural interior portions (electrical wiring, plumbing, etc.) need not comply with appropriate codes while in secured status. However, no fire, safety, health or other hazard may be permitted;

                  Sec. 26-51. - Overcharging prohibited. 
                  The City Council of the City of Richmond Hill hereby ordains that in order to preserve, protect or sustain the life, health or safety of persons, or their property, within any declared disaster area, it shall be unlawful, during the duration of any state of emergency or subsequent recovery period in which the city has been designated as a disaster area, for any person, firm or corporation located or doing business in the city to overcharge for any goods, materials, services, motel rooms, temporary lodging or houses, sold or rented, within the city. 
                  (Ord. of 10-4-05)

The term "overcharging" is charging prices for goods, materials, services or housing which are substantially in excess of the customary charges or, in applicable cases, substantially in excess of the suppliers' or providers' costs for such goods, materials, services or housing. The existence of overcharging shall be presumed from any substantial increase in the price at which the merchandise or cost/rental of housing was offered in the usual course of business immediately prior to the onset of the emergency, but shall not include increases in cost to the supplier directly attributable to the higher cost of material, supplies and labor costs resulting from the emergency. As used in this definition, the term "substantial increase" means any increase in any price for merchandise or cost/rental of housing of more than 35 percent. 
                  (b)  State of emergency. The term "state of emergency" is defined pursuant to O.C.G.A § 38-3-3(5) as a condition declared by the governor when, in his judgment, the threat or actual occurrence of a disaster or emergency is of sufficient severity and magnitude as to warrant extraordinary efforts in preventing or alleviating the damage, loss, hardship or suffering threatened or caused thereby. 
                  (c)  Subsequent recovery period. The term "subsequent recovery period" is defined as that period during which the disaster continues to cause disruptions in the disaster area, but shall not exceed six months after the emergency declaration has been terminated.

Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for this offense, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern that would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of this offense if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern.

Each applicant for an antenna and or tower shall provide to the building and zoning department an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the governing authority or within one quarter mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The building and zoning department may share such information with other applicants applying for conditional permitted use permits under this chapter or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority, provided, however that the building and zoning department is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
                  (6)  Aesthetics; lighting. The requirements set forth in this Section shall govern the aesthetics and lighting for telecommunications facilities. 
                  a.  Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
                  b.  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
                  c.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  d.  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. The city council shall, in making such decision, consider the criteria contained at section 63-6(b) and section 63-7 of this chapter. 
                  e.  Except for the manufacturer's name plate, advertising on telecommunications facilities shall be prohibited. 
                  (7)  Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this chapter shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided in Sections 41-2-8 through 41-2-17 of the Official Code of Georgia. 
                  (8)  Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the governing authority concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the governing authority may remove such tower at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided in Sections 41-2-8 through 41-2-17 of the Official Code of Georgia. 
                  (9)  Access. Access for maintenance vehicles shall be via collector, arterial right-of-way, approved access easements, or other access as approved by the City Planning Commission. 
                  (10)  Accessory structures. Accessory structures shall be used only to house equipment and other supplies in support of the tower operation. Such structures shall not be used for offices. Any equipment not used in direct support of tower operation shall not be stored on-site. 
                  (11)  Historic sites telecommunications facilities. Historic sites telecommunications facilities shall not be attached to or mounted to historically significant buildings or structures. 
                  (12)  Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device: provided, however, that the governing authority may waive such requirements, as it deems appropriate. The city council shall, in making such decision, consider the criteria contained at section 63-6(b) and section 63-7 of this chapter. 
                  (13)  Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers for which a conditional permitted use permit is required; provided, however, that the governing authority may waive such requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby. The city council shall, in making such decision, consider the criteria contained at section 63-6(b) and section 63-7 of this chapter. 
                  a.  Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent property. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least ten feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound. This buffer requirement applies to both owned or leased land. 
                  b.  In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived altogether. The city council shall, in making such decision, consider the criteria contained in section 63-6(b) and section 63-7 of this chapter. 
                  c.  Within three years, landscaping will produce a 90 percent screen of the base of the tower, the security fence, and any telecommunications facility building(s). Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible; however, the 90 percent screen within three years requirement still applies. This could be met by adding evergreens to the mature tree growth already in place. In some cases, such as towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the property perimeter may be sufficient buffer; however, this shall be the case only if the landscape buffer is on telecommunication facility property and/or is protected by a tree easement. A tree survey of existing trees by a registered surveyor must be submitted for verification that existing trees are sufficient.

                  (4)  Proof of ownership of the proposed site or documentation that the applicant has authorization from the owner to utilize the proposed site. 
                  (5)  Photo simulations or renderings of the proposed telecommunications tower(s) illustrating the potential visual impact, as viewed from at least two places nearby (public places if possible). (All costs for visual analysis, and applicable administrative costs, shall be borne by the applicant.) 
                  (6)  A written statement of the general capacity of a proposed tower in terms of the number and type of antennas it is designed to accommodate. 
                  (7)  Evidence to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's antenna. Such evidence must consist of the following: 
                  a.  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  b.  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  c.  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
                  d.  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
                  e.  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
                  f.  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
                  (b)  Factors considered in granting conditional permitted use. The governing authority shall consider the following factors in determining whether to approve a conditional permitted use, although the governing authority may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if the governing authority concludes that the goals of this chapter are better served thereby. 
                  (1)  Height of the proposed tower. 
                  (2)  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries.

                  (5)  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage. 
                  (6)  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness. 
                  (7)  Proposed ingress and egress. 
                  (8)  Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as discussed in section 63-6(a)(7) of this chapter. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the governing authority that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. 
                  (c)  Timeline for the application consideration process. The timeline for the consideration of a telecommunications facility application is 90 days. The timeline will begin with the submission of a complete application to the building and zoning department. If no decision has been made on the application by the 90th day after the submission of a complete application, the application will be considered approved.

If the person in charge of the vehicle to be towed makes such a request, or states a preference for a particular wrecker service, the radio dispatcher will make a reasonable effort to call the requested wrecker service, provided the wrecker service is listed on the rotational call list. 
                  (b)  If a wrecker service on the rotational call list is requested by the owner or other person in possession of a vehicle, the answer of the request by a wrecker service will not be construed as interrupting the member's normal rotation position on the rotational call list. In no event shall an investigating officer undertake to call directly for a wrecker service, but all such calls shall be made through the radio dispatcher. Unless requested by owner of a vehicle, no wrecker service can pull for another wrecker service. 
                  (Ord. of 7-10-95) 
                  Sec. 74-88. - Qualifications, duties. 
                  (a)  In order for any wrecker service to be placed on the rotational call list and be licensed under the provisions of this article, each wrecker service must agree in writing on a form to be furnished by the city, to maintain and comply with the qualifications, standards and requirements specified in subsections (b)—(p) at all times. 
                  (b)  The wrecker service shall have at least one light-duty wrecker in good operable working condition at all times. Each wrecker service shall notify the city radio dispatcher whenever it does not have a wrecker available for call or whenever it does not have any heavy-duty wrecker equipment to handle a particular type call requiring a heavy-duty wrecker. 
                  (c)  Each wrecker shall carry at any times when in service or use a full complement of service items, to include a fire extinguisher, chains, motorcycle bar, dollies, proper emergency reflectors (triangular in shape), and other equipment needed for lifting, extricating or righting wrecked vehicles, and the removal of vehicles from the public rights-of-way by towing or carting. In addition, each wrecker shall be equipped with a broom, shovel and other necessary equipment to clear the traveled portions of roadway. 
                  (d)  The wrecker service shall maintain or have access to a secured parking area where any towed vehicle may be safely stored. The parking (storage) area shall be secured at all times and must, in addition, at all times comply with all applicable provisions of city ordinances pertaining to junkyards and storage areas. If any participating wrecker service does not have adequate storage space, it will be incumbent upon that service to provide storage space at another location meeting the criteria set out in this article. Any wrecker service delivering a vehicle to a storage yard not his own will be responsible for storage fees. 
                  (e)  The wrecker service shall have at least one certified wrecker driver on duty for call at all times. 
                  (f)  The wrecker service shall at all times maintain at least one phone line in service to receive calls from the police department. 
                  (g)  In order to be placed on the rotational call list, a wrecker service shall not have any ownership interest, financial or otherwise in a wrecker owned, leased to, or operated by any other wrecker service. 
                  (h)  Wrecker services shall maintain in full force and effect at all times the following types and amounts of insurance: 

                   
                  At the time a wrecker is registered under this article, or such times as a wrecker service applies for renewal of its insurance, the wrecker shall furnish a copy of a certificate of insurance or policy showing the amount of coverage and expiration date thereof to the city. 
                  (i)  Each of the wreckers must be equipped with an emergency amber light, as required by state law and a current permit for such light. Each wrecker shall comply with regulations set forth by the public service commission governing for-hire towing. 
                  (j)  The wrecker service shall agree, as a condition precedent to being placed on the rotational call list, not to monitor any of the police department's radio channels (frequencies) for purposes of monetary gain (40 USC 65—Secretary of Communications). 
                  (k)  The wrecker service shall agree to accept only those requests for assistance from the police department or state patrol that can be answered by the wrecker service within 30 minutes in accordance with posted speed limits and that it is capable of handling, taking into consideration the type of wrecker required to accomplish the tow. 
                  (l)  The wrecker service shall agree to make any and all of its wreckers available for inspection by the police department during normal business hours and be inspected on an annual basis. 
                  (m)  All wrecker operators will agree that after being called to the scene of an accident for the purpose of removing damaged vehicles, they shall clean all the debris caused by the accident from the rights-of-way before they leave. If two or more wreckers are called to the same accident scene, cleaning the rights-of-way shall be borne equally by both operators. 
                  (n)  The wrecker operator and his employees will not engage in any deceptive practices in order to obtain business from a prospective customer. If a wrecker operator, or his employee, quotes one fee and then charges a higher fee without the consent of a customer, the wrecker operator or his employee will be presumed to have willfully engaged in a deceptive practice in violation of this article. The wrecker service and the police chief, or his representatives, will set fees for all normal wrecker requests. The company's charges for towing services requested under this agreement by the police department shall be no greater than as provided below. The charges shall be made against the owner of any removed vehicle, and the company hereby agrees to hold the city harmless and free from any responsibility for the charges. 
                  (o)  Each wrecker service shall clearly post its schedule of fees in a conspicuous location. Adjacent to the above mentioned schedule, a separate schedule of towing and storage fees for police head-out calls, identified as such, shall be maintained if such fees are different from the posted fees generally charged. 
                  (p)  Each wrecker service must provide service 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
