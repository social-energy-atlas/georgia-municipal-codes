( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015) 
Sec. 1.1.14. - Zoning maps.

The official zoning maps shall be adopted contemporaneously with this chapter in digital format and contained on a compact disk to be maintained in its original, unedited and unaltered form by the clerk to the board of commissioners. A printed copy of the compact disk's contents depicting the official zoning maps on the date of its initial adoption shall also be maintained in its original, unedited and unaltered form by the clerk to the board of commissioners. 
Any subsequent amendments made by the board of commissioners to the official zoning maps after the initial date of adoption with this chapter shall be indicated on the digital version of the official zoning maps by the director of planning. The director of the GIS department shall continuously maintain the digital version of the official zoning maps so that they accurately show all amendments made thereto by the board of commissioners since the initial date of adoption, indicating the dates of said amendments. A copy of the updated and current version of the official zoning maps in digital format, showing all amendments thereto since the date of initial adoption, shall be held in custody of the director of planning.

The clerk to the board of commissioners shall maintain custody of the minutes applicable to the referenced zoning case numbers, which state the zoning conditions. Uncertified copies of the official zoning maps may be provided to the public for informational purposes only. 
Verifications of the current zoning status of property shall be the responsibility of the director of planning. To verify the current zoning status of a particular parcel, an individual may obtain a certified copy of the official zoning maps, or a portion thereof, from the director of planning. Certified copies of the official zoning maps, or portions thereof, shall be certified by the director of planning with his signature and the date on which the portions were certified. The director of planning shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of all land, buildings and structures located in the county, except for: (1) amendments enacted by the board of commissioners but not yet depicted on the official zoning maps, and (2) uncertainties to be clarified by the board of commissioners as described in section 1.1.15.

Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of zoning districts as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
A.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow centerlines of rights-of-way or prescriptive easements. In case of closure of a street or alley, or vacation of any easement, the boundary shall be construed as remaining at its prior location unless ownership of the closure or vacated area is divided other than at the center, in which case the boundary shall be construed as moving to correspond with the ownership, but not beyond any previous right-of-way or easement line. 
B.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lot lines. 
C.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following county limit lines shall be construed as following such county limits. 
D.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following railroad lines shall be construed to be midway in the right-of-way. 
E.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following shorelines of bodies of water shall be construed to follow such shorelines. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of creeks, streams, rivers, or other predominantly linear bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines. 
F.  Boundaries indicated as parallel to or concentric with, or extensions of features indicated in paragraphs A. through E. above, shall be so construed. Distances and dimensions not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined from the official zoning map by the director of planning. 
G.  Where areas appear to be unclassified on the official zoning map, and classification cannot be established by the above rules, such areas shall be considered to be classified Residential Estate (RE) until action is taken by the board of commissioners to amend the official zoning map. 
H.  Where territory is added to the jurisdictional area, it shall be considered to be classified Residential Estate (RE) until action is taken by the board of commissioners to amend the official zoning map. 
I.  Where uncertainties continue to exist or further interpretation is required beyond that provided for in the above paragraphs, the question shall be presented by the director of planning to the board of commissioners to enact a clarifying resolution and said action shall be recorded on the official zoning map as is provided herein. 
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015) 
Sec. 1.1.16. - Rules applicable to parcels split into two or more zoning districts. 
Where a parcel of land is split into two (2) or more zoning districts, each such portion of said parcel may only be used for purposes allowed within the zoning district to which each respective portion is classified. No principal or accessory use of land, buildings or structures, and no use or building or structure authorized by special administrative permit, special land use permit, or special exception, shall be authorized unless said use or building or structure is authorized or permitted within the applicable zoning district. 
Where a parcel of land contains two (2) or more zoning classifications, the official zoning maps shall depict said parcel with a Multiple Zone ("MZ") designation. To verify the zoning status of respective portion(s) of a parcel containing multiple zoning classifications, an individual may obtain verification from the director of planning. 
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015) 
Sec. 1.1.17. - Severability. 
The several provisions of this chapter shall be separable in accordance with the following rules:

ARTICLE 3. - OVERLAY DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
27-3.1 DIVISION 1. - OVERLAY DISTRICTS 

Sec. 3.1.1. - Overlay districts generally. 
Overlay districts are supplemental to the zoning district classifications established in article 2 of this chapter. This section shall supersede the applicability statements in each overlay district, and are applicable as follows: 
A.  All development and building permits for lots located, in whole or in part, within any overlay district shall meet all of the regulations of the underlying zoning district in which they are located as well as all of the regulations of the applicable overlay district. 
B.  For new development after the effective date of this chapter, when no complete application for a land disturbance or building permit has been filed with respect to a property located within an overlay district and the property has conditions of zoning that were approved prior to, and in conflict with the overlay district regulations contained in this article, the overlay district regulations shall prevail. If a condition of zoning does not conflict with the overlay district regulations, the condition of zoning shall remain applicable to the property. 
C.  For existing development, if overlay district regulations conflict with the conditions of zoning applicable to property within in an overlay district, the existing zoning conditions remain applicable to the property. 
D.  If a use is permitted in the overlay district, but the underlying zoning requires a special land use permit for the same use, the overlay shall govern, and no special land use permit is required. 
E.  If overlay district regulations conflict with other regulations contained in this chapter, the overlay district regulations shall prevail. 
F.  The use of property may be permitted without rezoning if listed as allowed by the overlay. Uses allowed by the underlying zoning in article 4, may also be permitted in the overlay district, unless it is listed as prohibited or if the zoning district is not applicable in the overlay. 
G.  Each application for a business license, land disturbance permit, building permit or sign permit, which involves the development, use, exterior alteration, exterior modification or addition of any structure, must demonstrate compliance with all overlay district regulations, subject to article 8, nonconforming uses, structures and buildings. 
H.  The zoning district designations contained in article 3, titled Overlay District Regulations, were not revised to reflect the new zoning district designations utilized in the updated zoning ordinance effective June 1, 2015. The discontinued zoning district references contained in this article 3 shall therefore be construed using the conversion chart contained in Table 1.1 of article 1 of the zoning ordinance effective June 1, 2015, and applied as appropriate to the updated provision of the zoning ordinance.

If the proposed development is also located in an historic district as designated in the Code, the development shall also comply with the regulations established for the historic district in chapter 13.5 of the Code. 
C.  Review by staff. Staff will review the conceptual plans for compliance with specifications and design guidelines contained in this zoning ordinance. If the application fails to comply with any section in this zoning ordinance, the application shall be marked "failed compliance," shall be returned to the applicant with any comments and/or redlines for revisions, and may be re-submitted with corrections addressing the staff's comments and/or redlines for further consideration. Once the application is found to be in compliance, the final design shall be forwarded to the director of planning for approval. 
1.  Where the director of planning determines that said plans comply with the requirements of the overlay district, the director of planning shall approve the plans for compliance as part of the application for land disturbance, building or signs permits. 
2.  Where the director of planning determines that submitted conceptual plans do not comply with the requirements of this chapter, then the director of planning shall notify the applicant in writing of the manner in which the conceptual plans fail to comply with such requirements. All applications shall be considered and decided by the director of planning within thirty (30) days of receipt of a complete application.

Sec. 3.22.14. - Parking requirements and design. 
A.  All land uses indicated shall provide off-street parking spaces in the amounts defined in Table B "Standards for Off-Street Parking—Emory Village District." These parking requirements consider the proximity to the university and the pedestrian-oriented design within the Emory Village Overlay District. All uses not listed shall meet the parking requirements of the underlying zoning district. 
Table 3.6: Standards for Off-Street Parking 

 
B.  To satisfy these parking requirements, parking may be located on the businesses/restaurants/residences lots and/or on other lots within the district. Shared parking between land uses within the district is encouraged and may result in permitted reductions of off-street parking requirements. Parking facilities within the district may be shared if the uses generate parking demands primarily at different times of the day or if a use has excess off-street parking capacity. Applicants may submit a plan for shared parking to the director of planning and development for authorization of shared parking. Such plans shall include: 
1.  A scaled map indicating location of all proposed parking spaces; 
2.  A parking demand study by a licensed professional traffic engineer that documents the hours of business operation(s) for the land uses sharing the parking during all times of operation or occupancy and during all seasons of the year. Such study shall also provide sufficient data to document the actual or projected demand for parking and indicate the actual number of spaces that must be provided to satisfy such demonstrated demand; 
3.  Written consent of all property owners to the shared or off-site parking arrangement. 
C.  The planning and development director or designee shall review the above documents and, based on the results of the study, may permit the reduction of the total required parking for the uses by no more than twenty (20) percent of the total. Such shared parking arrangements shall remain in force for the duration of the written consent agreement set forth in subsection (3) above. A renewed consent agreement shall be provided to the planning and development director to ensure adequate parking capacity before a certificate of occupancy shall be granted for a new use subject to the terms of the agreement. Lack of a current lease shall automatically terminate the authorization and place the applicants in violation of the zoning ordinance. 
D.  Owners of accessory parking facilities that provide excess spaces beyond the minimum required to serve all on-site uses may enter into written agreements to allow said excess spaces to supply required parking for other land uses within the village center. 
E.  Any change in use of a building, shop or leased area shall require compliance with the parking standards in this section to obtain a certificate of occupancy. 
F.  Parking credits: 
1.  Priority open space parking credit. The requirements of subsection A. shall be reduced by constructing priority open space contained within the regulating plan, subject to the following: 
a.  Priority open space shall be in a natural state or landscaped. Such space shall not be used for vehicles, except for incidental service, maintenance or emergency actions. 
b.  A parking credit of one (1) space for every two hundred (200) square feet of priority open space may be applied to the requirements of subsection A. 
c.  Parking credits shall not be transferred off site. 
d.  In no event shall the application of parking credits accrued by the provisions of this section, in combination with shared parking or any other provision of this division or other county ordinances, result in fewer parking spaces being provided than the minimum number required to satisfy actual peak projected parking demand for both residential and nonresidential uses as documented in the shared parking analysis and subject to approval by the planning director pursuant to subsection B.(2). 
2.  Sidewalk credit. The requirements of subsection A. may be reduced to account for portions of private property utilized to provide the publicly accessible sidewalks identified in [section] 3.22.12, subject to the following: 
a.  A parking credit of one (1) space for every two hundred (200) square feet of new sidewalk, when located on private property, shall be applied to the requirements of subsection A. 
b.  Parking credits shall apply to publicly or privately funded sidewalks. 
c.  Parking credits shall apply retroactively to existing publicly accessible sidewalks located on private property, and shall remain in effect for the duration thereof. This credit shall only cease when the publicly accessible sidewalk is purchased as public right-of-way. Public access easements through private property shall not cause a cessation of this credit. 
d.  Parking credits shall not be transferred off site.

The planning director or designee shall consolidate all plan reviews and comments in a written submission to the historic preservation commission. 
D.  Variances. Applications for variance shall not require a certificate of appropriateness. The planning and development director or designee shall provide all variance applications arising under chapter 14 or 27 of this Code to the historic preservation commission for study and investigation within five (5) business days of receipt of the application that complies with all applicable requirements set forth in this Code. The historic preservation commission shall issue its recommendation within forty-five (45) days receipt of the variance application. No application for a variance under chapter 14 or 27 shall be considered complete until such time as the historic preservation commission has had an opportunity to provide its recommendation in writing. If no written recommendation is issued within the applicable time frame, then the planning commission and the zoning board of appeals shall construe the recommendation to have been for approval. A recommendation for approval or denial of a variance by the preservation commission shall not be binding on the zoning board of appeals or the planning commission. 
E.  Subdivision sketch plat approval. Sketch plat approval from the planning commission shall not require a certificate of appropriateness. The planning and development director or designee shall provide all sketch plats arising under chapter 14 of this Code to the historic preservation commission for study and investigation within five (5) business days of receipt of the application and sketch plat. The historic preservation commission shall issue its recommendation within thirty-five (35) days of the official acceptance of the application and sketch plat. No application for sketch plat approval shall be considered by the planning commission until such time as the historic preservation commission has had an opportunity to provide its recommendation in writing. If no written recommendation is issued within the applicable time frame, then the planning commission shall construe the recommendation to have been for approval. A recommendation for approval or denial of a sketch plat by the preservation commission shall not be binding on the planning commission.

J.  On-street parking. On-street parking is an efficient manner to provide convenient store-front parking and residential parking on minor streets in order to reduce the need for large surface parking lots. See Exhibits 1 and 2. An on-street parking space along the street frontage of an adjacent parcel shall not be counted with off-street and shared parking to meet parking requirements of chapter 27 when such parking space is within seven hundred (700) feet of a building entrance for which the parking space is required. On-street parking spaces shall be safely accessed from the travel lanes of the adjoining street, paved to the specifications of public streets and demarcated with painted lines not less than three (3) inches in width. Parallel parking spaces shall be not less than nine (9) feet wide and not less than twenty (20) feet in length. DeKalb County shall have sole authority to determine time limits, metering, and signage of on-street parking spaces on public streets within the overlay district. 
K.  Off-street parking lots. Off-street parking lots shall be provided where there is not enough on-street parking available to satisfy the minimum parking requirements of chapter 27 and the Northlake Commercial Center Overlay District. Where possible, off-street parking lots shall be designed with interconnecting driveways and parking areas to encourage shared use with adjacent parcels. Joint access driveways and continuous access drives behind or between multiple parcels is encouraged to provide continuous inter-parcel access and lessen the need to re-enter public streets to make short trips. The satisfaction of minimum parking requirements with shared parking shall be subject to approval by the DeKalb County Planning Director based on a shared parking analysis performed to the standards of the Institute for Transportation Engineers. 
Off-street parking lots shall be designed to minimize the view of parking from adjacent streets and sidewalks. No more than thirty (30) percent of the required parking spaces for a parcel shall be located in front yards. Off-street parking lots shall be separated from abutting streets by landscape strips and sidewalks as illustrated in Exhibits 1 and 2. Parking lots shall be separated from parking lots on adjacent parcels by landscape strips not less than ten (10) feet in width, planted with shrubbery, trees, and groundcover. Landscape strips may be broken by perpendicular access drives and pedestrian walkways or sidewalks. Plant materials shall be selected from the approved plant list in the appendix unless otherwise approved by the planning director. 
Off-street parking lots shall be designed to provide for safe and continuous passage of pedestrians between parking bays and building entrances, and between adjacent parking areas and buildings. Landscape strips at the perimeter of off-street parking lots shall provide for safe and convenient crossings by vehicles and pedestrians as shown in Exhibit 8. Pedestrian pathways in parking lots and pedestrian ways that cross vehicular aisles in parking lots shall be appropriately demarcated as shown in Exhibit 8. 

L.  Landscaping. Planting design should reflect and enhance the natural surroundings of each site as well as the design objectives of the building. Existing trees and native groundcover should be preserved wherever possible and integrated into the overall landscape design. Existing plant materials that are to be retained shall be clearly designated on the landscape plans and their root zones and tree canopies shall be adequately protected from damage or destruction during construction using suitable barricades or fencing. Newly planted trees, shrubs and groundcover materials used in landscaped areas shall be selected from the approved plant list in the appendix unless otherwise approved by the planning director.

Evergreen groundcover planting shall be used on all slopes steeper than two and one-half (2½) to one (1) to aid in erosion control. 
Landscape planting and irrigation plans must be prepared by a landscape architect registered in the State of Georgia for each application for a land-disturbance permit. 
Transitional buffer zone —Where the transitional buffer zone is well vegetated and provides an adequate visual screen at eye level, it shall be undisturbed. Otherwise, the transitional buffer zone shall be either planted with double staggered rows of approved evergreen trees and shrubbery to form a dense visual screen or the existing vegetation shall be enhanced with native landscaping and groundcover adequate to provide an effective visual screen at eye level from adjacent properties. However, transitional buffer zones may be interrupted where necessary for perpendicular crossings of streets, fences, driveways utilities, and trails, bikeways or pedestrian ways. 
Parking lot landscaping —The total length of any parking area facing a street shall be separated from the street by landscaping, including evergreen shrubbery at least eighteen (18) inches in height.

The original of the Greater Hidden Hills Overlay District Map and all its amendments will be maintained by the planning director. Any changes to the Greater Hidden Hills Overlay District Map dated October 28, 2011, will require a map amendment and a text amendment revising this section to reflect the revised map for the district. 
B.  The district shall be divided into five (5) tiers and one residential area to guide future development and redevelopment. The tiers and the residential area are based on the future land use recommendations. The tier structure is as follows: 
1.  Tier 1. Tier 1 is a medium-intensity area focused around the activity center at the intersection of Covington Highway and South Hairston Road and the commercial corridor along both sides of Covington Highway between South Hairston Road and the boundary of the I-20 Overlay District at the Panola Road and Covington Highway intersection. The purpose of this tier is to allow more intense mixed-use development along Covington Highway, a major thoroughfare. The goal is to redevelop oversized parking areas with new buildings including retail, office, and residential uses within mixed-use developments to decrease the need for vehicular trips. The maximum height shall be up to five (5) stories with a maximum density of thirty (30) dwelling units/acre. 
2.  Tier 2. Tier 2 is a low-intensity area located at the neighborhood center on Redan Road at its intersection with South Hairston Road and Panola Road, and the neighborhood center at the intersection of Panola Road and Young Road.

The maximum height shall be up to three (3) stories with a maximum density of twenty-four (24) dwelling units per acre. 
3.  Tier 3. Tier 3 is a preservation open space area comprised of properties designated as flood hazard areas by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the county. Such properties are limited to passive recreation areas, pathways, trails and a golf course. 
4.  Tier 4. Tier 4 is a conservation open space area comprised of properties which are of such size, configuration and topography which would cause undue impacts on adjoining properties if developed. The properties are to be used for active and passive recreation areas and associated accessory structures. 
5.  Tier 5. Tier 5 is a neighborhood mixed-use area which allows for increased density, increased building heights, and additional permitted uses within a mixed-use environment. The purpose of Tier 5 is to allow increased development in an area where it is needed while preserving/conserving property within Tiers 3 and 4. 
6.  Residential AREA. The residential area is primarily composed of homes and will not be required to comply with any of the regulations for the district set forth in this division or the district design guidelines.

( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015) 
Sec. 3.39.2. - District boundaries, tiers and sub-areas, and map. 
The boundaries of the district are delineated in the Bouldercrest-Cedar Grove-Moreland Overlay District Map which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, dated March 22, 2013, and adopted with this division as a map amendment to the official zoning map of DeKalb County. The director of planning and sustainability shall be the final authority to determine whether any property is located within the boundaries of the district. Any changes to the Bouldercrest-Cedar Grove-Moreland Overlay District Map will require a map amendment and an accompanying text amendment revising this section to reflect the revised map for the district pursuant to the procedures of chapter 27, article 7, division 3—Official zoning map, text, and comprehensive plan land use map amendments. 
The district shall be divided into five (5) tiers to guide future development and redevelopment. Within these tiers are two (2) gateways and two (2) corridors. The corridors and gateways are sub-areas of the tiers, and as such will adhere to the uses and standards of the underlying tier, unless exceptions are otherwise specifically stated. The tier, gateway and corridor structure is as follows: 
A.  Tier 1 and Gateway 1. Tier 1 is a medium-intensity area focused around the activity center at the interchange of Bouldercrest Road north of I-285. The purposes of this tier are to allow more intense mixed-use development along Bouldercrest Road, which is a major thoroughfare, and to encourage redevelopment of oversized parking areas, old motels, outdated shopping centers, old apartments and other uses that are incompatible with redevelopment. New buildings including retail, office, and residential uses within mixed-use developments will be encouraged and will decrease the need for vehicular trips. Gateway 1 is a sub-area within Tier 1 at the interchange of Bouldercrest Road and I-285. The uses and requirements of Tier 1 apply to Gateway 1, with additional design requirements. These additional requirements are specified in the design guidelines under "Streets and Sidewalks—Gateways 1 & 2." 
B.  Tier 2. Tier 2 is a moderate-intensity area within an existing light industrial zoned area centered at the intersection of Moreland Avenue and Cedar Grove Road. The goal of this tier is to encourage the consolidation of properties for higher intensity industrial development within a mixed used context. Tier 2 allows commercial uses and convenience goods and services, thereby reducing the need for vehicular trips outside the district. Residential development is not allowed in this tier. 
C.  Tier 3. Tier 3 is a low-intensity area at the intersection of Bouldercrest Road and Cedar Grove Road. The goal of this tier is to promote evolution into a neighborhood center, by allowing small scale development in a mixed-use context, providing for a more compatible use to adjacent single-family neighborhoods. 
D.  Tier 4, Gateway 2 and Corridor 2. Tier 4 is the existing industrial zoned area along Moreland Avenue, and the goal of this tier is to encourage the development and redevelopment of industrial properties, but to higher design standards than currently exist. Gateway 2 is a sub-area within Tier 4 at the interchange of Moreland Avenue and I-285. The requirements of Tier 4 apply to Gateway 2, with additional design requirements because of its sensitive location. These additional requirements are specified in the design guidelines under "Streets and Sidewalks—Gateways 1 & 2." Corridor 2 is a sub-area in Tier 4. All requirements of Tier 4 are applicable in Corridor 2, with additional design requirements illustrated in the design guidelines under "Streets and Sidewalks—Corridors 1 & 2." The goal of the additional requirements for Tier 4 and its sub-areas is to enhance the visual quality of the primary roads in Tier 4, and additional features that support this goal are encouraged. 
E.  Tier 4A. Tier 4A. is the industrial area along the east side of I-675 and west of the existing Georgia Power Overhead Utility Easement located north of Henrico Road. Because Tier 4A. is only separated from residential neighborhoods by the utility easement, uses and standards are more stringent in this tier. 
F.  Tier 5 and Corridor 1. Tier 5 constitutes the existing single-family residential areas in the district. Legally existing homes as of the date of this division's adoption will not be required to comply with the regulations in this division or district design guidelines as set forth in subsection C., unless undergoing major improvements as described in subsection D. above. The principal uses of land and structures in this tier shall be as provided by the table of uses and the applicable underlying zoning district classification. This tier addresses design issues, such as location of structures, design varieties, landscaping, lighting and entrance signage. Corridor 1 is a sub-area in Tier 5. All requirements for Tier 5 are applicable in Corridor 1, with additional design requirements illustrated in the design guidelines under "Streets and Sidewalks—Corridors 1 & 2." The goal of these additional requirements is to enhance the aesthetic quality of the primary roads in Tier 5, and additional features that support this goal are encouraged.

It is thereby declared to be a public purpose to administer and enforce the following minimum design guidelines for all new development within the BCGM Overlay District. 
3.  These design guidelines are intended to augment and enhance chapters 14, 27 and other guidelines of the DeKalb County Code of Ordinances, which shall remain in full force and effect within the BCGM Overlay District. 
4.  The goals of these guidelines include: 
a.  To provide for connectivity of streets and communities and reduce the dependence on automobile use by increasing the ease of movement and opportunities for alternative modes of travel; and 
b.  To ensure a proportional relationship of surrounding buildings with respect to the general spacing of structures, building mass and scale, and street frontage by using techniques to achieve compatibility, such as: 
c.  Use of additional façade detail; proportion of façade elements, doorways, projections and insets; window scale and pattern; and creation of strong shadow lines as decorative elements; 
d.  Use of consistent setbacks from property lines; 
e.  Development of consistent sidewalks and a more active, interesting pedestrian environment; 
f.  Use of landscaping, lighting and street furniture to unify district buildings and define space; and 
g.  Use of compatible building materials to promote a design and building aesthetic consistent with Oglethorpe University and the desired urban village character. 
5.  These design guidelines shall be administered by the DeKalb County Planning and Sustainability Department. Applicants for development permits are encouraged to schedule a pre-application conference with the planning department in order to assure full understanding and compliance with these design guidelines. Interpretations, disputes, and appeals with respect to the interpretation and application of these design guidelines shall be resolved by the Director of the DeKalb County Planning and Sustainability Department. 
B.  [District boundaries.] 

C.  Streets and sidewalks. 
1.  [Generally.] Public and private streets shall meet all the requirements for public streets in chapter 14 of the DeKalb County Code of Ordinances, Land Development, and the BCGM Overlay District with the following exceptions and enhancements unless otherwise indicated in the ordinance: 
a.  The design of streets within the BCGM Overlay District shall provide for the continuous and interconnected travel of automobiles, transit buses, bicycles, and pedestrians between points of origin and destination within the district, and shall provide for maximum continuity with streets, transit routes, sidewalks, bicycle lanes, trails, paths, and greenways that enter and leave the overlay district from surrounding areas. 
b.  Any new streets shall enhance connectivity within the BCGM Overlay District by connecting at least two (2) public streets. When blocks are subdivided by new streets, the maximum length of resulting new blocks shall be three hundred (300) linear feet, or six hundred (600) feet along Moreland Avenue. 
c.  Gates and security arms shall be prohibited from crossing any public street or sidewalk. 
d.  All utilities shall be located underground. 
e.  Plan below is to illustrate location of design elements-it is not drawn to scale. 
Exhibit 1 

Refer to the table in section 3.39.6 of the ordinance for dimensions and specifics of street and sidewalk design. 
f.  All Streets in Tiers 2 and 4 must be designed to accommodate large trucks. 
2.  On-street parking. On-street parking is an efficient manner to provide convenient store-front parking and residential parking on minor streets in order to reduce the need for large surface parking lots. On-street parking spaces along the street frontage of an adjacent parcel shall not be counted with off-street parking and shared parking to meet parking requirements of chapter 27. On-street parking spaces shall be safely accessed from the travel lanes of the adjoining street, paved to the specifications of public streets and demarcated with painted lines not less than three (3) inches in width. Parallel parking spaces shall be not less than nine (9) feet wide and not less than twenty (20) feet in length. DeKalb County shall have sole authority to determine time limits, metering and signage of on-street parking spaces on public streets within the overlay district. On-street parking shall be provided on street types as indicated in Table 1. On street parking stalls shall be demarcated with painted boundaries not less than three (3) inches in width and shall be a minimum of nine (9) feet in width and twenty (20) feet in length. 
3.  Medians. In roads with more than two (2) lanes, raised medians shall be designed and constructed to provide for safe and convenient crossings for persons with disabilities and shall provide refuge for pedestrians at crosswalks, as shown in Exhibit 1.

Properties that require more than one hundred (100) parking spaces shall provide bike racks with at least one (1) parking stall per one hundred (100) vehicular parking spaces. Bicycle racks shall be securely anchored to the ground or a permanent structure, and shall be located adjacent to outdoor lighting sources. 
5.  Sidewalks and pedestrian ways. The BCGM Overlay District shall be designed to minimize the need for vehicular transportation and to promote pedestrian and bicycle circulation throughout the overlay district. The construction of continuous sidewalks along all streets and off-street pedestrian ways between all building entrances, between adjacent parking lots and connecting streets with adjacent parking lots, transit stops and building entrances is required throughout the overlay district. See Exhibit 1, page 5, showing sidewalks along streets. See page 28, for an illustration of off-street pedestrian ways linking parking lots and building entrances. Sidewalks are also encouraged within greenways and other outdoor recreational areas. 
a.  Sidewalks in the overlay district shall be as listed in the table under section 3.39.6, and constructed of four-inch-thick poured in place concrete. Minimum side slope for all sidewalks shall be two (2) percent. Alternatively, sidewalks may be constructed with brick, stone, or similar durable paver materials to add aesthetic interest and visibility, especially at building entrances, in plazas, in pedestrian crosswalks and at other pedestrian intersections with vehicular routes. Asphalt is not an acceptable paving material for sidewalks or pedestrian ways. 


b.  To the extent feasible, sidewalks and pedestrian ways shall be aligned vertically and horizontally to minimize the impact on existing topography and vegetation while forming a continuous pedestrian system. Sidewalks and pedestrian ways that join at property lines or with existing sidewalks shall match the elevation, alignment and cross slope of the abutting sidewalks to form a safe, smooth and continuous sidewalk system. 
c.  Landscape strips (the area between the sidewalk and the back of curb) shall be planted with grass, ground cover and flowering plants, or consist of brick pavers, concrete pavers or granite pavers where on-street parking is provided or pedestrian crossings and/or congregation is likely. Pedestrian zones shall be paved in concrete and kept clear and unobstructed for the safe and convenient use of pedestrians. Street trees shall be planted in the landscape strip, unless the strip is less than five (5) feet wide—in which case, the trees must be planted in the landscape zone outside the limits of the sidewalk. Trees shall be selected from the recommended plant list at the end of these guidelines from the first section labeled 'street trees.' Where overhead utilities exist, trees shall be selected from the second section, labeled 'small trees.' 
d.  Safe and convenient pedestrian pathways shall be provided from sidewalks along streets to each structure entrance, including pedestrian access routes to parking decks and through parking lots and between adjacent buildings within the same development. All walkways shall be concrete and a minimum width of five (5) feet. 
e.  Sidewalk paving materials shall be continued across any intervening driveway at the same prevailing grade and cross slope as on the adjacent pedestrian sidewalk area. Alternatively, approved striping and/or pavement markings may be used to connect pedestrian route across drives and parking lots. 
f.  Benches, trash receptacles, and bike racks shall be placed within the landscape strip at high pedestrian traffic areas. 
6.  Crosswalks. All crosswalks and other intersecting points between the pedestrian and vehicular traffic systems shall be clearly marked as shown in Exhibit 7. The use of approved brick, concrete or stone paving materials to identify crosswalk areas is encouraged. Crosswalks shall be designed to meet DeKalb County's guidelines of use for disabled persons. Crosswalks for median-divided streets shall provide for barrier-free passage and refuge areas as illustrated in Exhibit 1. Cross-walks shall be accompanied by pedestrian signals where required by DeKalb County and in conformity with the Manual for Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 

Exhibit 2: Crosswalk delineation. 

a.  Crosswalks must be clearly marked to meet DOT standards. All crosswalks must have ADA standard curb cuts. Bricks or concrete pavers delineating the walks are desirable. Pavers and planting in islands is required to create landing zones for pedestrians where free-flow turns are installed (see below). 

b.  It is desirable to install pedestrian plazas at street intersections. 


c.  Decorative paving may be used in the landscape strip. Street lights are to be located in this strip, along with street trees (maximum forty (40) feet o.c.). Planting beds (min. fifteen (15) feet long) must occur in the landscape strip, no more than sixty (60) feet o.c. 

 

 
D.  Streets and sidewalks—Residential. 

1.  For multi-family and attached single-family housing in Tiers 1 and 3, there must be a minimum five-foot landscape strip behind the curb, a minimum eight-foot wide sidewalk, and a front yard of eight (8) feet minimum and fifteen (15) feet maximum. This front yard shall be for landscaping, porches and steps. Decorative fences are also allowed. Live/work units may have up to seventy (70) percent of this front yard paved. 


2.  Six-foot-wide sidewalks are required on both sides of the streets in all new Tier 5 single-family residential development. A four-foot minimum landscape strip is required between the curb and sidewalk. 

 

3.  New residential developments Tier 5 must not have any vertical improvements (buildings, walls over three (3) feet, etc.) within the setback from the current right-of-way for adjacent existing buildings. Buildings facing the existing road must be articulated like the building's front, including continuation of the same materials. All homes must carry the design and materials of the front to all sides visible from the street. 
4.  When new homes are built on infill lots in existing neighborhoods, these homes must maintain (or exceed) the standards of the existing homes—size, quality of materials, placement, design detailing, etc. 

 
E.  Streets and sidewalks—Corridors 1 and 2.

All homes must carry the design and materials of the front to all sides visible from the street. 
b.  Sidewalks (eight-foot width minimum) must be installed with an eight-foot wide landscape strip. Landscape strip must be planted with grass and groundcovers. Street trees must also be planted, but varieties and spacing must reflect existing conditions—use similar species and place trees to continue existing appearance (do not introduce formal structure into an informal area, etc.) 
c.  Deceleration/acceleration lanes are discouraged—use only where required. 

2.  Corridor 2. 
a.  New developments in Corridor 2 have a building setback maximum of ninety-five (95) feet. One double-loaded bay of parking is allowed in front, behind a twenty-foot wide landscape strip. Direct pedestrian access from the public sidewalk is required, with clear sidewalk connections across drives and parking delineated with changes in color, texture, striping or other materials. Connections with adjacent parcels are also required—both auto/parking and pedestrian. 
b.  There must be no more than ten (10) parking spaces in a row between tree/landscape islands. These islands must have a minimum of two hundred twenty (220) square feet of pervious area for landscaping. 
c.  Curb cuts must be at least one hundred twenty-five (125) feet apart, and shared entrances are recommended to minimize the number of curb cuts. 

Site Concept Example for: Corridor 2 
F.  Streets and sidewalks—Gateways 1 and 2. 
1.  The Gateway areas represent the opportunity to create a positive first impression on all visitors. Developments in these areas must take advantage of this opportunity to represent the community in a positive way. 
2.  Because of the proximity to I-285, these buildings should be multi-story, with prominent architectural features. Only one (1) double loaded bay of parking is allowed between the building and any right-of-way. Landscape strips must buffer view of parking from the right-of-way.

ARTICLE 4. - USE REGULATIONS 
27-4.1 DIVISION 1. - OVERVIEW OF USE CATEGORIES AND USE TABLE 

Sec. 4.1.1. - Overview, findings, purpose. 
A.  General overview. The regulations contained within this article IV shall apply to all zoning districts within DeKalb County except as otherwise specified herein. Dimensions, site location and architectural requirements shall be indicated on required site development plans. 
B.  General findings and purpose. Certain land uses require the imposition of additional regulations to mitigate a range of negative impacts on the public health, safety, welfare as well as environmental, aesthetic, and infrastructure impacts. 
C.  Findings and purpose for certain land uses. National studies show that a concentration of certain land uses—including alcohol outlets, automobile gas stations, check cashing establishments, convenience stores, drive-through restaurants, and pawn shops—negatively impact the public health, safety, welfare, property values, economic development and social vitality of communities and neighborhoods. Local governments across the country recognize the negative impacts of such uses and impose additional regulations and distance requirements to mitigate such impacts. Local studies, including the report "The Relationship Between SLUP6 Businesses and Negative Outcomes in DeKalb County" by Dean Dabney, Ph.D., presented to the board of commissioners on May 9, 2017, confirm that these land uses within unincorporated DeKalb County are associated with increased crime, automobile accidents, lower property values, and other negative impacts to the public health and welfare.

( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015) 
Sec. 4.2.6. - Adult entertainment establishments, adult services facility. 
A.  The regulations that follow and that otherwise are contained in the DeKalb County Code of Ordinances regarding adult entertainment establishments constitute content-neutral requirements that have been carefully designed to minimize adverse impacts caused by secondary effects of these establishments. The county finds that studies in other jurisdictions, including but not limited to studies referenced in section 15-100, et seq. of the Code, demonstrating a correlation between these establishments and such negative secondary effects as diminishing market values in neighboring residential and related areas, increasing crime rates, difficulty in securing residential and related financing, an influx of patrons to these establishments from outside the immediate neighboring areas, and similar effects, are pertinent and relevant to the situation that exists in DeKalb County. The county further finds that there is evidence in DeKalb County demonstrating a correlative link between adult entertainment establishments and pernicious secondary effects upon surrounding communities. The county finds that adoption of regulations restricting these establishments to certain districts and imposing distance and development standards is consistent with the general comprehensive planning standards and policies of the county, will reduce the negative secondary effects caused by these establishments, and will afford protection to residential uses and other uses consistent with residential uses so as to protect the public health, safety and welfare while respecting and protecting the free speech rights of these establishments. 
B.  Adult entertainment establishments shall be subject to the following standards: 
1.  An adult entertainment establishment shall be located no closer than one thousand (1,000) feet from another adult entertainment establishment.

2.  An adult entertainment establishment shall be located on property that is located no closer than one thousand (1,000) feet from a residential district or from property being used for residential purpose. The measurement of distances for purpose of this paragraph shall be from property line to property line along the shortest possible course (i.e., "as the crow flies"), regardless of any customary or common route or path of travel. 
3.  An adult entertainment establishment shall be located no closer than one thousand (1,000) feet from any governmental facility, church, residence, park, library, school ground, day care, or college campus. The measurement of distances for purposes of this paragraph shall be from property line to property line along the shortest possible course (i.e., "as the crow flies"), regardless of any customary or common route or path of travel. 
4.  The minimum lot area for an adult entertainment establishment shall be two (2) acres. 
5.  Adult entertainment establishments shall be located on lots with a minimum of one hundred fifty (150) feet of road frontage on a public road, street, or highway.

A.  Purpose and goals. The purpose of this section is to ensure that residents, public safety operations, and businesses in DeKalb County have reliable access to wireless telecommunications networks and state of the art communication services while also ensuring that this objective is achieved in a manner consistent with DeKalb County's planning and zoning standards, to maintain to the extent possible the aesthetic integrity of the community, and in accordance with applicable state law and with federal law, regulations, and guidance, including the Telecommunication Act of 1996 which preserved, with certain limitations, local government land use and zoning authority concerning the placement, construction, and modification of wireless telecommunication facilities. The goals of this section are: 
1.  To ensure DeKalb County has sufficient wireless infrastructure to support its public safety communications throughout the county; 
2.  To provide access to reliable wireless telecommunication services by residents, businesses, and visitors throughout all areas of the county 
3.  To minimize the total number of support structures within the county by promoting and encouraging the joint use of new and existing wireless support structures among wireless service providers; 
4.  To encourage the location of wireless support structures, to the extent possible, in areas where adverse impacts on the community will be minimized; 
5.  To encourage the design and construction of towers and antennas to minimize adverse visual impacts; 
6.  To avoid potential damage to property caused by wireless communications facilities by insuring that such structures are soundly and carefully designed, constructed, modified, maintained, and removed when no longer used or when determined to be structurally unsound; 
7.  To preserve those areas of scenic or historic significance; 
8.  To facilitate implementation of an existing tower map for DeKalb County;

B.  Definitions. For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions apply: 
Abandon means when a tower is not operated for a continuous period of six (6) months. 
Accessory equipment means any equipment serving or being used in conjunction with a telecommunications facility or support structure. This equipment includes, but is not limited to, utility or transmission equipment, power supplies, generators, batteries, cables, equipment buildings, cabinets and storage sheds, shelters or other structures. 
Administrative approval means zoning approval that the director of planning is authorized to grant in the form of a special administrative permit. 
Administrative review means evaluation of an application by the director of planning in connection with the review of an application for a building permit. 
Antenna means any communications equipment that transmits, receives, or transmits and receives electromagnetic radio signal used in the provision of all types of wireless communication services including, but not limited to, cellular, paging, personal communications services (PCS) or microwave communications. Such structures and devices include, but are not limited to, directional antennas, such as panels, microwave dishes and satellite dishes, and omnidirectional antennas, such as whips. This definition does not apply to broadcast antennas, antennas designed for amateur radio use, or satellite dishes designed for residential or household purposes. 
Application means a formal request submitted to DeKalb County to construct, collocate or modify a wireless support structure or a wireless facility. 
Attached wireless telecommunications facility means an antenna or antenna array that is secured to an existing building or structure (except an antenna support structure) with any accompanying pole or device which attaches it to the building or structure, together with transmission cables and an equipment cabinet, which may be located either on the roof or inside/outside of the building or structure, and do not significantly change the profile of the existing structure and are not readily noticeable to the untrained eye. Attached wireless telecommunications facilities may be concealed or contained in an architectural feature and should complement the existing theme and rhythm of the structure. An attached wireless telecommunications facility is considered to be an accessory use to the existing principal use on a site. 
Carrier on wheels or cell on wheels ("COW") means a portable self-contained telecommunications facility that can be moved to a location and set up to provide wireless services on a temporary or emergency basis. A COW is normally vehicle-mounted and contains a telescoping boom as the antenna support structure, though it may use a separate temporary mast for the placement of antennas. 
Collocate or collocation means the placement or installation of new wireless facilities on previously approved and constructed wireless support structures, including monopoles and towers, both self-supporting and guyed, in a manner that negates the need to construct a new freestanding wireless support structure. Such term includes the placement of accessory equipment within an existing equipment compound. 
Distributed antenna systems ("DAS") means a network of spatially separated antenna nodes connected to a common source via a transport medium that provides wireless service within a geographic area or structure. 
Equipment compound means an area surrounding or adjacent to the base of a wireless support structure within which accessory equipment is located. 
Existing structure means previously erected support structure or any other structure, including but not limited to, buildings and water tanks, to which telecommunications facilities may be attached. 
Fall zone means the maximum distance from its base a wireless support structure will collapse in the event of a failure, usually less than the total height of such structure. This distance must be defined by a professional civil or structural engineer licensed in the State of Georgia. 
Geographic search area (GSA) means a geographic area designated by a wireless provider or operator as the area within which a new telecommunication facility must be located to serve an identified system need, produced in accordance with generally accepted principles of wireless engineering. 
Modification means the improvement, upgrade, expansion, or replacement of wireless facilities on an existing wireless support structure or within an existing equipment compound and may include: (i) an increase in structure height of a pre-existing tower up to thirty (30) percent so long as such height increase does not trigger FAA lighting requirements; or (ii) the removal and replacement of a pre-existing tower with a new tower at the same location that may be up to thirty (30) percent taller so long as any such structure height increase does not trigger FAA lighting requirements. 
Monopole means a single, freestanding pole-type structure supporting one (1) or more antennas. For purposes of this section, a monopole is not a tower. 
Ordinary maintenance means action taken to ensure that telecommunications facilities and support structures are kept in good operating condition. Ordinary maintenance includes inspections, testing and modifications that maintain functional capacity, aesthetic and structural integrity; for example the strengthening of a support structure's foundation, or of the support structure itself. Ordinary maintenance includes replacing antennas of a similar size, weight, shape and color and accessory equipment within an existing telecommunications facility, and relocating the antennas of approved telecommunications facilities to different height levels on an existing monopole or tower upon which they are currently located. Ordinary maintenance does not include modifications. 
Replacement means constructing a new support structure of the same proportions and of equal height, or such other height that would not constitute a modification to a pre-existing support structure, in order to support a telecommunications facility or to accommodate collocation and removing the pre-existing support structure.

Table 6.2: Off-street Parking Ratios 

 
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015) 
Sec. 6.1.5. - Off-street parking reduction for shared parking. 
Parking spaces for any existing or new mixed-use development may be based upon a shared parking formula as set forth in Table 6.3. 
Shared parking may be utilized for any of the combinations of uses shown in Table 6.3. If shared parking is to be used to satisfy the requirements of this article, an application shall be submitted to the director of planning seeking approval of a shared parking plan. The applicant must submit a scaled site plan for each site that will participate in the shared parking showing zoning, use, and existing parking facilities. Shared parking agreements approved by the director of planning shall be executed prior to issuance of any certificate(s) of occupancy for the development. 
In any shared parking agreement, at least fifty (50) percent of shared parking spaces must lie within seven hundred (700) feet of the main entrance to the principal use for which the parking is provided, and all shared parking spaces must lie within one thousand (1,000) feet of the main entrance to the principal use for which the parking is provided. Shared spaces shall not be separated from the site by a roadway with more than four (4) through-travel lanes, unless there is a well-marked, safe pedestrian crossing such as a pedestrian hybrid beacon, a signalized crosswalk, or a refuge median. 
Any change in the use of a building, shop or leased area that relies on a shared parking agreement to meet its parking requirements shall require compliance with the parking standards in this article based on the new use in order to obtain a certificate of occupancy. No right to shared parking shall vest in a property where the use of the property changes. In the event that property on which the shared parking is located has a different owner than the owner of the principal development, a written shared parking agreement between all relevant property owners, approved by the director of planning and filed on the deed records in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court for DeKalb County, shall be provided prior to approval of a certificate of occupancy for the principal development. Expiration for any reason of a shared parking agreement, on which compliance with this article is based, shall automatically terminate the related certificates of occupancy and place the property owner(s) in violation of this zoning ordinance. 
The steps for determining parking requirements in a mixed use development are: 
A.  Determine the minimum amount of parking required for each separate use (Table 6.2). 
B.  Multiply each parking requirement by the corresponding percentage for each of the time periods given below. 
C.  Calculate the column total parking requirement for each time period. 
D.  The largest column total is the shared parking requirement. 
E.  Example of shared parking calculation: 
If the following uses were proposed with the following example number of parking spaces in accordance with the individual use: 
Office - 400 spaces, Retail - 300 spaces, and Restaurant uses - 100 spaces, with a total parking for individual use on site: 800 spaces 
Then these same land uses under the provisions for shared parking would require the number of parking spaces shown in the example Table 6.4 (by applying the percent reduction in Table 6.3): 
Table 6.3: Shared Parking Reduction Table 

 
  
Table 6.4: Example of Shared Parking Reduction Calculation 

 
As shown in the weekdays 6:00 a.m.—5:00 p.m. column, 6:30 parking spaces would be needed for this example development. This is a reduction of one hundred seventy (170) required spaces.

The property owner's obligation to comply with this requirement shall be limited to the extent legal permission to construct and utilize the required shared drive can be obtained from the neighboring property owner. 
C.  Inter-parcel access requirements. Inter-parcel access for vehicles between abutting and nearby properties shall be provided so that access to individual properties can be achieved between abutting and nearby developments as an alternative to forcing all movement onto highways and public roads, unless the director of planning during the land disturbance permitting process determines that it is unnecessary to provide inter-parcel access due to the unlikelihood of patrons traveling among abutting or nearby sites, or due to inability after reasonable efforts by the property owner to obtain legal permission from the abutting property owners for such inter-parcel access.

The chairperson of the zoning board of appeals, or in his or her absence the acting chairperson, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses by subpoena. 
A.  Requirements. The standards and requirements of this zoning ordinance and decisions made by public officials are presumed to be valid and just. It shall be the responsibility of an applicant seeking relief to assume the burden of proof and rebut this presumption by presenting sufficient facts and evidence to explain how the proposed appeal or variance is consistent with the general spirit and intent of this zoning ordinance and the comprehensive plan. 
B.  Review. It is the duty of the zoning board of appeals to review such facts and evidence in light of the intent of the zoning ordinance to balance the public health, safety and general welfare against the injury to a specific applicant that would result from the strict application of the provisions of this zoning ordinance to the applicant's property. 
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015) 
Sec. 7.5.2. - Appeals of decisions of administrative officials. 
A.  General power. The zoning board of appeals shall have the power and duty to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that there is error in any final order, requirement, or decision made by an administrative official based on or made in the enforcement of this zoning ordinance or as otherwise authorized by local law or the Code of DeKalb County as Revised 1988. Administrative officials must make final decisions covered by this section within one hundred eighty (180) days of receipt of all necessary information to make such decision. A failure to act prior to the passage of one hundred eighty (180) days shall not be construed to be a final order, requirement or decision within the meaning of this division. If a decision is not made by the one hundred eighty-first day, the requested decision is deemed denied, and becomes appealable. All such appeals shall be heard and decided following the notice requirements of section 7.2.4, and pursuant to the following criteria and procedural requirements. 
B.  Appeals of decisions of administrative officials. Appeals of decisions of administrative officials may be filed by (1) any person aggrieved by; (2) any elected member of the DeKalb County Governing Authority affected by; or (3) an owner of property within two hundred fifty (250) feet of the nearest property line of the property that is the subject of any final order, requirement, or decision of an administrative official, based on or made in the enforcement of this zoning ordinance, or as otherwise authorized by local law or the Code of DeKalb County as Revised 1988. by filing with the secretary of the zoning board of appeals an application for appeal, specifying the grounds thereof, within fifteen (15) days after the action was taken by the official that is the subject of the appeal. 
C.  Appeal stays all legal proceedings. An appeal of a decision of an administrative official stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action or decision appealed from unless the official from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the zoning board of appeals, after notice of appeal has been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in that official's opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such a case, legal proceedings shall be stayed only pursuant to a restraining order granted by a court of competent jurisdiction directed to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown. 
D.  Appeal stays land disturbance or construction activity in certain situations. If the action or decision appealed from permits land disturbance or construction activity to commence or continue on residentially zoned property, the appeal stays the land disturbance or construction activity until the zoning board of appeals issues a decision on the appeal. Thereafter, land disturbance or construction activity in such cases shall only be stayed by an order from a court of competent jurisdiction. In all cases involving non-residentially zoned property, the appeal to the zoning board of appeals does not stay land disturbance or construction activity; such activity shall only be stayed by an order from a court of competent jurisdiction. 
E.  [Order granted by court.] Thereafter, in such situations land disturbance or construction activity shall only be stayed by an order granted by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
F.  Time of hearing. The zoning board of appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal and give notice thereof pursuant to the requirements of section 7.2.4 as well as written notice to the appellant. Any party may appear at the hearing in person, by an agent, by an attorney, or by the submission of written documentation. 
G.  Decision of the zoning board of appeals. Following the consideration of all testimony, documentary evidence, and matters of record, the zoning board of appeals shall make a determination on each appeal and shall issue a written decision explaining the reasons for its decision. The zoning board of appeals shall decide the appeal within a reasonable time, but in no event more than sixty (60) days from the date of the hearing. An appeal shall be sustained only upon an expressed finding by the zoning board of appeals that the administrative official's action was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact, erroneously applied the zoning ordinance to the facts, or that the administrative official acted in an arbitrary manner. In exercising its powers, the zoning board of appeals may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and to that end shall have all the powers of the administrative official from whom the appeal was taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit, provided all requirements imposed by any applicable laws are met.

Sec. 7.5.3. - Applications for variances; and criteria to be used by the zoning board of appeals in deciding applications for variances. 
The zoning board of appeals shall hear and decide applications for variances from the strict application of the regulations of this chapter and chapter 21 where the strict application of any regulation enacted under said chapters would result in exceptional and undue hardship upon the owner of such property. In determining whether or not to grant a variance, the board shall apply the criteria specified in this section to the facts of each case. The board may attach reasonable conditions to any approved variance in accordance with section 7.3.9. Once imposed, conditions shall become an integral part of the approved variance and shall be enforced as such. No changes to an approved condition attached to a variance shall be authorized except by re-application to the zoning board of appeals in full compliance with the applicable provisions of this division. No relief may be granted or action taken under the terms of this division unless such relief can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without substantial impairment of the intent and purpose of this chapter and the comprehensive plan. The zoning board of appeals shall apply the following criteria to the types of applications specified below as follows:

Sec. 8.1.2. - Applicability. 
A.  Applicability. Nonconforming regulations apply only to those nonconforming situations that were legally authorized when established or that were subsequently approved through procedures in effect at the time the approval was obtained. Additionally, except as provided in section 8.1.5.B., nonconforming situations must have been maintained continuously and without interruption since the initial existence or subsequent approval of the nonconforming situation. Nonconforming situations which were not authorized when established or have not been continuously maintained over time in accordance with this subsection have no legal right to continue and must terminate as set forth herein. 
B.  Documentation. An owner or applicant may request from the director of planning a determination of nonconforming status. The owner or applicant must provide documentation sufficient to show that the situation was authorized when established and was continuously maintained over time. Upon receipt of the owner or applicant's evidence, the director of planning will determine if the evidence is satisfactory and, if so, shall issue a written determination that the lot, building, structure and/or use is a legal nonconforming situation. The burden of establishing the nonconforming status of a particular lot, building, structure or use is on the applicant or owner of the property or use. 
C.  Evidence that a nonconforming situation was authorized when established. Standard evidence that the proposed nonconforming situation was authorized, or legal, when established includes, but is not limited to: 
1.  Building or land disturbance permits; 
2.  Business licenses; 
3.  Adopted zoning ordinances or maps in force at the time of permitting; 
4.  Conditions of zoning; 
5.  Other appropriate evidence as determined by the director of planning or designee. 
D.  Evidence that a nonconforming situation has been continuously maintained since inception. Standard evidence that the proposed nonconforming use has been continuously maintained without interruption since inception includes, but is not limited to: 
1.  Utility bills; 
2.  Tax records; 
3.  Business licenses; 
4.  Advertisements in dated publications; 
5.  Insurance policies; 
6.  Leases; 
7.  Receipts; and 
8.  Other appropriate evidence as determined by the director of planning or designee. 
E.  Evidence of discontinuance or abandonment. When considering whether a nonconforming situation has been continuously maintained without interruption since inception, the director of planning may consider evidence of the following: 
1.  Failure to maintain regular business hours, typical or normal for the use; 
2.  Failure to maintain equipment, supplies or stock-in-trade that would be used for the active operation of the use; 
3.  Failure to maintain utilities that would be used for the active operation of the use; 
4.  Failure to pay taxes, including but not limited to sales tax, workers' compensation taxes, corporate taxes that would be required for the active operation of the use; 
5.  Failure to maintain required local, state or federal licenses or other approvals that would be required for the active operation of the use; 
6.  Failure to maintain applicable business license(s); and 
7.  Other appropriate evidence as determined by the director of planning. 
F.  Change to a conforming situation. A nonconforming situation may be changed to a conforming situation by right. Once a conforming situation occupies a site that was previously nonconforming, the nonconforming rights are lost, and a nonconforming situation shall not be re-established. 
G.  Maintenance. Normal maintenance and repair of nonconforming situations is allowed and does not alter legal conformity status. 
H.  Strengthening and restoring to safe condition. Nothing in this article shall prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of any part of a building or structure declared unsafe by the director of planning, and such strengthening or restoration shall not cause the loss of nonconforming status, provided such strengthening or restoration would not constitute a violation of section 8.1.15's regulation of reconstruction of damaged or destroyed nonconforming structures. 
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015) 
Sec. 8.1.3. - Legal nonconforming lot. 
A lot of record that at the effective date of this zoning ordinance does not conform to the applicable minimum road frontage requirement, minimum lot area, or lot width requirements for the zoning district in which it is located may still be used as a building site provided that the height, buffer, setback, and other dimensional requirements of the zoning district in which the lot of record is located are complied with, or a variance therefrom is obtained. 
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015) 
Sec. 8.1.4. - Legal nonconforming single-family lots; lot merger requirements. 
A.  In any zoning district in which single-family dwelling units are allowed, a single-family dwelling unit and allowed accessory structures may be erected on any single nonconforming lot of record so long as such single nonconforming lot of record is not in common ownership with any other contiguous lot or lots. A property owner shall not be permitted to erect a structure on a nonconforming lot of record if he could have used his contiguous land to avoid the nonconformity. 
B.  Two (2) or more contiguous lots of record that are held in common ownership on the effective date of this section or come into common ownership after the effective date of this section shall be governed by this subsection B. or subsection C. If any contiguous lots of record held in common ownership do not meet the requirements established in this Code for street frontage, access requirements, lot width or lot size, then all of the contiguous lots of record held in common ownership shall be considered to be an undivided lot for the purpose of compliance with the provisions of this Code. No portion of the resulting undivided lot shall then be considered a separate lot, a nonconforming lot of record or used or conveyed in a manner which is not in compliance with the existing street frontage, access, lot width or lot area requirements established by this Code and/or any amendments thereto. No division of any hereby merged nonconforming lots of record held in common ownership shall be made which creates a substandard lot. If two (2) or more contiguous nonconforming lots of record are in common ownership and, as merged, the property is compliant for development with a single-family dwelling without violating the provisions of this Code, then none of the former nonconforming lots of record may be considered nonconforming and authorized for single-family development. A property owner shall not be permitted to create a nonconforming lot of record if he could have used his contiguous lots to avoid the nonconformity. 
C.  Two (2) or more nonconforming contiguous lots of record that are held in common ownership as of the effective date of this section, or that come into common ownership after the effective date of this section shall be governed by the requirements of subsection B. unless the owner obtains a variance from the DeKalb County Zoning Board of appeals pursuant to the provisions and the criteria set forth in article 7. 
D.  Whenever a variance from the strict application of subsection B. is sought with respect to properties located within a historic district as defined in chapter 13.5 of this Code, the variance applicant shall first obtain a certificate of appropriateness from the historic preservation commission finding that the proposed variance allowing the subject lot to retain its legal nonconforming status will not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In approving such a certificate of appropriateness, the historic preservation commission may include a finding that merger of lots pursuant to the strict application of subsection B. would have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district.

Sec. 8.1.5. - Nonconforming use. 
A legal use in existence on the effective date of this zoning ordinance or any amendment thereto may be continued even though such use does not conform with the use provisions of the zoning district in which said use is located, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
A.  Change of use. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use. A change in tenancy or ownership shall not constitute termination or abandonment of the nonconforming use, provided that the use itself remains unchanged and is continuously maintained. 
B.  Discontinuance or abandonment. A nonconforming use shall not be re-established after discontinuance or abandonment for six (6) consecutive months, unless the cessation of the nonconforming use is a direct result of governmental action impeding access to the property. Vacancy or non-use of a building for six (6) continuous months, regardless of the intent of the owner or tenant, shall constitute discontinuance or abandonment under this subsection. 
C.  A nonconforming use of land shall not be enlarged, expanded, moved, or otherwise altered in any manner that increases the degree of nonconformity. 
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015) 
Sec. 8.1.6. - Nonconforming structures. 
A.  A legal structure in existence on the effective date of this zoning ordinance or any amendment thereto that could not presently be built under the provisions of this chapter because of restrictions on building area, lot coverage, height, minimum yard setbacks, or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot shall be deemed a legal nonconforming structure subject to this article 8. 
B.  No legal nonconforming structure shall be enlarged, or structurally altered, in a way that increases its degree of nonconformity, except as expressly permitted in this article 8. 
C.  Alteration of legal nonconforming structures occupied by permitted, conforming uses may be allowed for improvement or modification, provided that the structure may not be enlarged and the alterations must either comply with this chapter or result in a reduction in site or structure nonconformity.

If a property is required by a federal, state or local government to provide right-of-way or easements that cause an existing structure to have non-conforming yards or setbacks, the property and structure shall be deemed to be legal nonconforming, and, from that time forward, the owner may not expand any existing building in a way to increase the degree of nonconformity or to build new structures that are nonconforming. 
( Ord. No. 15-06 , 8-25-2015)

Sec. 146. - Trust indenture as security for issuance of bonds. 
In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the authority, including the proceeds derived from the sale, from time to time, of any surplus property of the authority, both real and personal.

It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture.

(Acts 1974, p. 2591, § 1; Acts 1975, p. 3053, § 1) 
Sec. 487. - Legislative findings and declaration of public necessity. 
It is hereby found, determined and declared that there continues to exist in DeKalb County, Georgia, a seriously inadequate supply of, and critical need for, decent, safe and sanitary housing within the financial means of families and persons of limited income, including but not restricted to those families and persons displaced by slum clearance and the clearance of blighted areas, transportation projects or other public programs. This shortage of decent, safe and sanitary housing is inimical to the safety, health, convenience and welfare of the residents of DeKalb County and the State of Georgia and otherwise exacerbates existing slum conditions which in turn contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of crime, impairs economic values, necessitates excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and safety, fire and accident prevention and other services, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of urban areas, aggravates traffic problems and promotes juvenile delinquency and other social ills. It is hereby found that the ordinary operations of private enterprise cannot provide an adequate supply of decent, safe and sanitary housing which persons and families of limited income can rent or purchase. It is also found that private enterprise alone cannot provide or achieve the urgently needed rehabilitation of existing housing to a decent, safe and sanitary condition so that it can be rented or purchased by families and persons of limited income. As a result, families and persons of limited income are forced to reside in housing which is indecent, unsafe and unsanitary. Accordingly, it is determined that it is a valid public purpose and a matter of public health, safety, convenience and welfare to provide decent, safe and sanitary housing for families and persons of limited income who otherwise would be unable to rent or purchase same and to encourage the investment of private capital and the participation of private enterprise in providing such housing. 
It is further found that there exists at 2170 Johnson Ferry Road in DeKalb County, Georgia, a tract of land on which certain improvements presently exist, commonly and hereinafter called the "Oglethorpe tract." Said tract is appropriate for development, rehabilitation and use as a housing development wherein decent, safe and sanitary housing can be provided for families and persons of limited income and said tract is hereby designated as the area of operation of the authority. Notwithstanding the fact that the authority shall be restricted geographically to said area of operation insofar as the physical location of any of its housing developments or projects is involved, it shall be concerned with the housing needs of all families and persons of limited income who are residents of DeKalb County. 
(Acts 1974, p. 2591, § 2; Acts 1975, p. 3053, § 3) 
Sec. 488. - Definitions.

(g)  Families or persons of limited income shall mean families or persons of low or moderate income deemed by the authority to require such assistance in securing decent, safe and sanitary housing as it is empowered by this act [division] to provide on account of insufficient family or personal income taking into consideration, without limitation, such factors as (i) the amount of the total income of such families or persons available for housing needs; (ii) the size of the family; (iii) the cost and condition of housing facilities which are available; (iv) the eligibility of such families and persons for federal housing assistance of any type predicated upon their low or moderate income status; and (v) the ability of such families and persons to compete successfully in the then existing housing market and to pay the amounts at which private enterprise is providing decent, safe and sanitary housing. Except as otherwise provided in this act [division], the authority shall fix income limits as to families or persons who shall be entitled to rent or purchase dwelling accommodations in any housing development sponsored by the authority. In defining the income of any family for the purpose of this act [division], the authority shall consider income from all sources of each member of the family residing in the household, except there shall be excluded: 
(1)  The income of any family member, other than a head of household or his spouse, who is under eighteen (18) years of age or is a full-time student; 
(2)  The first three hundred dollars ($300.00) of the income of a secondary wage earner who is the spouse of the head of household;

(4)  Nonrecurring income, as determined by the authority; 
(5)  Five (5) percentum of the family's gross income; and 
(6)  Such extraordinary medical or other expenses as the authority approves for exclusion. 
In no event shall the authority commit to aid any family, including "one-person families," pursuant to this act [division] where the income of such family at the time exceeds eighty (80) percentum of the median family income of families of the same size in DeKalb County. Where disabled, handicapped or elderly persons are involved, the authority may, pursuant to rules and regulations adopted by its board of directors, exceed the limitation expressed in the next preceding sentence, but in no event shall it exceed a limitation of ninety-five (95) percentum of said median family income. 
(h)  Area of operation shall mean the area within which the authority is authorized by this act [division] to carry out the public purposes herein specified.

This act [division] shall be known and may be cited as the "DeKalb County Special Services Tax Districts Act." 
(Acts 1982, p. 4396, § 1) 
Sec. 567. - Definitions. 
As used in this act [division], the term: 
(1)  Constitutional amendment means the amendment to the Constitution of Georgia of 1976 ratified at the general election of 1978 and set forth in Georgia Laws 1978, pages 2468—2471 [§ 555 of this appendix], which provided that municipalities lying wholly within DeKalb County and the DeKalb County portion of any municipality lying wholly or partially within DeKalb County shall constitute special services tax districts for the provision of certain governmental services therein by DeKalb County and providing that DeKalb County shall assess, levy, and collect ad valorem taxes and collect service charges or fees within such special services tax districts only in accordance with the kind, character, type, and degree of such governmental services provided therein by said county and authorizing the general assembly to provide by law for such matters. 
(2)  DeKalb municipalities means that portion of the City of Atlanta lying within DeKalb County and the cities of Avondale Estates, Chamblee, Clarkston, Decatur, Doraville, Lithonia, Pine Lake, and Stone Mountain. 
(3)  Unincorporated area means that portion of DeKalb County lying outside the corporate limits of DeKalb municipalities. 
(4)  District services means the following governmental services provided by DeKalb County to DeKalb municipalities and unincorporated areas as defined in paragraphs (2) and (3) of Section 2 of this Act [subsections (2) and (3) of this section]: 
(A)  Basic police services comprised of services performed by the uniform division, traffic unit, park patrol, criminal investigation division, and crime scene investigation unit of the DeKalb County police department;

(5)  Declined governmental services means any governmental service identified in paragraph (4) of this section that a DeKalb municipality specifically elects to exclude from district services by means of a fully executed, valid resolution of its governing body, which declined governmental service will no longer be performed by DeKalb County for that DeKalb municipality. 
(Acts 1982, p. 4396, § 2; Acts 2010, p. 3548, § 1) 
Sec. 568. - Findings; purposes; authority. 
(a)  The general assembly finds that the kind, character, type, and degree of district services provided by DeKalb County varies among DeKalb municipalities and between those municipalities and the unincorporated area of the county. Based on studies of the provision of district services by DeKalb County, the general assembly further finds that the variation in the provision of district services is quantifiable for each DeKalb municipality and for the unincorporated area so that the DeKalb County ad valorem tax levied to finance the provision of district services may be adjusted by a factor established by law for each DeKalb municipality and for the unincorporated area to the end that the rate of such ad valorem tax shall bear a reasonable relationship to the value of district services actually received by residents of the county within each DeKalb municipality and within the unincorporated area. It is the purpose of this act [division] to implement the intention of the constitutional amendment by establishing the factor for each DeKalb municipality and for the unincorporated area which DeKalb County shall be required to apply to the county ad valorem tax levied to finance the provision of district services to adjust the millage rate of such tax for each DeKalb municipality and for the unincorporated area. 
(b)  This act [division] is pursuant to the authority of the constitutional amendment which specifically provides that ". . . the general assembly shall be authorized by law to control the subject matter of this paragraph and to further define and implement the provisions thereof, including the deletion of services designated herein as `district services' or the addition of other `district services,' or any combination thereof, in such manner and pursuant to such terms and conditions as the general assembly may provide by such law." 
(Acts 1982, p. 4396, § 3) 
Sec. 569. - Special services tax districts. 
Each DeKalb municipality shall constitute a special services tax district composed of that portion of DeKalb County lying within the corporate limits of each respective DeKalb municipality, and the unincorporated areas shall constitute a special services tax district composed of all the unincorporated areas of DeKalb County. For the purposes of this Act, each such special services tax district shall be designated by the name of its respective DeKalb municipality, except for that portion of DeKalb County lying within the corporate limits of the City of Atlanta, which shall be designated "Atlanta in DeKalb," and the unincorporated area, which shall be designated "DeKalb."

Sec. 570. - District services ad valorem tax. 
The district services ad valorem tax shall be determined annually by the governing authority of DeKalb County as follows:

Editor's note— Acts 1989, p. 4165, § 1, amended Acts 1982, p. 4396, by adding § 6A following § 6. The editor has designated the new section as 571.1. 
Sec. 571.2. - Particularized millage rates for governmental services. 
(a)  Particularized millage rate. After the county determines the adjusted district services ad valorem tax millage rate for each DeKalb municipality as provided in Sections 5 and 6 of this Act [sections 570 and 571 of this division], the county shall calculate a particularized millage rate applicable to each DeKalb municipality for each governmental service. The particularized millage rate shall be used to reduce a DeKalb municipality's adjusted district services ad valorem tax millage rate in the event such municipality declines governmental services. 
(b)  Standardization for parks and roads governmental services. In determining a particularized millage rate for parks and roads governmental services, as defined in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of paragraph (4) of Section 2 of this Act [subsections 567(4)(C), (D) of this division], the county shall establish a standardized particularized millage rate so that annually each DeKalb municipality shall be subject to the same standardized particularized millage rates for parks and roads governmental services. The standardized particularized millage rates for parks and roads governmental services may fluctuate annually based on budgetary levels, but the rate charged to DeKalb municipalities shall not exceed the rate charged to DeKalb. 
(c)  Calculation. The county shall calculate the particularized millage rate in the following manner: The county shall determine the total budgeted appropriations for district services for all special services tax districts and then divide the budgeted appropriations allocated to each governmental service by the total budgeted appropriations. Each resulting number shall be the percentage of appropriations allocated to each governmental service which shall then be multiplied by the adjusted district services ad valorem tax millage rate for each DeKalb municipality reflected in subsection (b.1) of Section 6 of this Act [subsection 571(b.1) of this division]. The resulting numbers shall be the raw particularized millage rates. The county shall use the raw particularized millage rates for parks and roads governmental services to assist in establishing the standardized particularized millage rates for parks and roads governmental services. The county shall deduct the standardized particularized millage rates for parks and roads governmental services from the adjusted district services ad valorem tax millage rate for each DeKalb municipality and shall separate the resulting number into a particularized millage rate for each municipality for basic and nonbasic police services based on the proportion that the budgeted appropriation for each police service bears to the total police services budgeted appropriations. The particularized millage rates for each governmental service may fluctuate annually based on budgetary levels. 
(d)  Real estate tax statement. Beginning with the year 2011 the adjusted district services ad valorem tax for basic police services and nonbasic police services identified in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (4) of Section 2 of this Act [subsections 567(4)(A), (B) of this division] shall be reflected on the real estate tax statement as a separate line item tax for each such district service, and the adjusted district services ad valorem tax for the remaining district services identified in paragraph (4) of Section 2 of this Act [subsection 567(4) of this division] shall be reflected on the real estate tax statement as a single line item tax.

Sec. 572. - Other county and municipal powers not affected. 
The provisions of this act [division] shall apply only to district services, as defined by paragraph (4) of section 2 of this act [§ 567 of this appendix], provided by DeKalb County and shall not affect ad valorem taxes levied by DeKalb County or DeKalb municipalities or other sources of revenue available to the county or DeKalb municipalities to fund other governmental services. Nothing in this act [division] shall be construed to prohibit DeKalb County or DeKalb municipalities from creating other or additional special service tax districts or from entering into contracts with each other governing the provision of other governmental services. However, unless pursuant to a contract authorized by section 8 of this act [§ 573 of this appendix], the requirements of this act [division] shall not be superseded or abrogated by the exercise of any powers possessed by DeKalb County or DeKalb municipalities. 
(Acts 1982, p. 4396, § 7) 
Sec. 573. - Contracts for district services. 
(a)  The governing authority of DeKalb County and the governing authority of any DeKalb municipality are authorized to enter into contracts governing the provision of district services by DeKalb County. In the event any such contract is entered into, the requirements of this act [division], as to the DeKalb municipality entering the contract, shall be suspended during the period the contract is in effect, and the provision of district services by DeKalb County within the DeKalb municipality entering into the contract and the funding of such district services shall be controlled by the contract. 
(b)  In the event DeKalb County and a DeKalb municipality enter into a contract authorized by subsection (a) of this section, the adjustment to the district services ad valorem tax millage rate for the unincorporated area shall be the millage rate applied to taxable property within the unincorporated area which will produce the total amount determined under paragraph (3) of section 5 of this act [§ 570 of this appendix] less: 
(1)  The amount derived by DeKalb County from special services tax districts, except the special service[s] tax district of the DeKalb municipality which has entered into a contract with DeKalb County, from the adjusted ad valorem tax millage rates levied pursuant to subsection (b) of section 6 of this act [§ 571 of this appendix]; and 
(2)  The amount derived, if any, by DeKalb County from the DeKalb municipality which has entered into a contract with the county in payment for the provisions of district services within the municipality by the county. 
(c)  In the absence of a contract authorized by this section or upon the expiration of any such contract or upon any such contract ceasing to be effective for any reason, the provisions of this act [division] shall govern ad valorem taxes levied by DeKalb County within each special services tax district to finance the provisions of district services by the county. 
(d)  At least once a year, the member or members of the Atlanta city council whose districts cover "Atlanta in DeKalb," the president of the Atlanta city council or his designee, the mayor of the City of Atlanta or his designee, the chief executive officer of DeKalb County or his designee, the presiding officer of the DeKalb county commission or his designee, the member or members of the DeKalb county commission whose districts cover "Atlanta in DeKalb," and any staff deemed necessary and appropriate to the discussions from both the Atlanta city council and the DeKalb county commission shall meet for the purpose of discussing delivery of services in "Atlanta in DeKalb." Such meeting shall be advertised once a week for two (2) weeks immediately preceding the date of such meeting. No activity requiring action by both the city council and the county commission shall be initiated or undertaken at any meeting conducted under this subsection. 
(Acts 1982, p. 4396, § 8; Acts 1990, p. 4601, § 1) 
Sec. 574. - Declined governmental services. 
Each DeKalb municipality comprising a special services tax district shall receive all district services and shall be subject to the adjusted district services ad valorem tax as calculated in Sections 5 and 6 of this Act [sections 570 and 571 of this division], unless the governing body of a DeKalb municipality declines any governmental services as follows: 
(1)  Beginning with the year 2011, the governing body of any DeKalb municipality may decline to have DeKalb County perform any or all district services as defined by paragraph (4) of Section 2 of this Act [subsection 567(4) of this division] by delivering to DeKalb County a fully executed, valid resolution of its governing body identifying the declined governmental services. Such DeKalb municipality resolution shall be delivered to the chief executive officer and each commissioner of DeKalb County, via certified United States mail or private delivery service, such as UPS or Federal Express, prior to 5:00 p.m. on or before September 30, 2010. If a fully executed, valid resolution is received by the chief executive officer and commissioners of DeKalb County in the manner required by this paragraph, then the county shall reduce that municipality's adjusted ad valorem tax millage rate for district services by the particularized millage rate of the declined governmental services, effective beginning January 1, 2011, and continuing thereafter from year to year unless modified in the manner provided in paragraph (2) of this section. 
(2)  After January 1, 2011, if a DeKalb municipality chooses to decline a district service, whether alone or in addition to already declined district services, the governing body of such DeKalb municipality may deliver to DeKalb County a new resolution identifying any declined governmental services. Such DeKalb municipality resolution shall be delivered to the chief executive officer and each commissioner of DeKalb County, via certified United States mail or private delivery service, such as UPS or Federal Express, prior to 5:00 p.m. on or before June 30. In the event a fully executed, valid resolution is received by the chief executive officer and the commissioners of DeKalb County in the manner required by this paragraph, then in the new year following receipt of such resolution, the county shall reduce that municipality's adjusted ad valorem tax millage rate for district services by the particularized millage rate of the declined governmental services. 
(3)  If any DeKalb municipality fails to enact a resolution in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (1) or (2) of this section, then the adjusted district services ad valorem tax for that DeKalb municipality shall be calculated in the manner set forth in Sections 5 and 6 of this Act [sections 570 and 571 of this division]. If the county ceases entirely to perform one of the district services identified in paragraph (4) of Section 2 of this Act [subsection 567(4) of this division], then each DeKalb municipality shall have its adjusted ad valorem tax millage rate for district services reduced by the particularized millage rate for that discontinued service. 
(4)  If any DeKalb municipality enacts a resolution as provided in paragraph (1) or (2) of this section, DeKalb County shall provide no declined governmental services to that DeKalb municipality unless and until DeKalb County agrees to restore a previously declined governmental service in the manner provided in paragraph (5) of this section. 
(5)  The governing body of any DeKalb municipality may request that the county perform a previously declined governmental service by forwarding a written request to the chief executive officer and each commissioner of DeKalb County identifying with specificity the governmental service sought. The request shall be forwarded via certified United States mail or private delivery service, such as UPS or Federal Express, prior to 5:00 p.m. on or before June 30. The governing authority of DeKalb County may, in its sole discretion, decide whether it will provide the previously declined governmental service to the DeKalb municipality. The finance director shall forward the county's decision in writing to the mayor of the affected DeKalb municipality within 15 business days of the county making its decision, and the county shall make its decision within 90 days of receiving a DeKalb municipality's request. If the county agrees to provide the previously declined governmental service, the county shall begin providing the governmental service on January 1 of the new year following receipt of the resolution, and an increased adjusted ad valorem tax millage rate for district services shall be determined and levied in conformity with the applicable requirements of this Act.

Sec. 901. - Definitions. 
Officers, employees and deputies, as the terms are used herein, shall include elected county officials, officers and employees of DeKalb County, employees and deputies of county officers by whatever name or title employed or deputized, and all other persons including officers and employees of the county who perform any service for the benefit of DeKalb County for which they are paid a salary, including part-time employees, regular employees, deputies and elected officials who are not contributing to any other pension plan of the State of Georgia or any institution, bureau or department thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this act [article], in the event DeKalb County, along with the State of Georgia or any institution, bureau or department thereof, contributes to the salary of any aforesaid officer, employee or deputy, such officer, employee or deputy may participate in the county retirement system but only to the extent of that participant's county paid salary and, in such case, only the county paid portion of such salary shall be considered compensation for the purpose of determining benefits and payment of contributions under this act [article]. 
In the event DeKalb County, along with the State of Georgia, contributes to the salaries of the officers, deputies and employees aforesaid, and such person is under the system of pension and retirement pay for officers, deputies and employees of DeKalb County as of January 1, 1971, the total salaries of said officer, employee or deputy from all such sources shall be counted as compensation for the purpose of determining benefits and payment of contributions. DeKalb County shall withhold monthly the required contribution by said employee to the pension fund as outlined in this act [article] for such amounts of income; and it is further provided that DeKalb County shall pay into the pension fund the employer's contribution for the total amount of said income at the rate required under this act [article]. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this act, with regard to any DeKalb County State Court judge that participates in a retirement plan of the State of Georgia, if such judge's yearly salary exceeds the amount allowed by law to be applied toward a state retirement plan, then the judge may participate in the county retirement system, but only to the extent of the portion of such judge's salary that exceeds the salary allowed by law to be applied toward the state retirement system (hereinafter referred to as "additional salary") and, in such case, only the additional salary shall be considered compensation for the purpose of determining benefits and payments of contributions under this act. Any judge to whom this paragraph applies may be entitled to credit against his service for all periods of time his salary as a state court judge exceeded that allowed by law to be applied toward a state retirement plan, provided such judge shall restore to the pension fund all sums that would have been deducted from the additional salary as pension contributions, together with interest thereon at the rate of eight (8) percent per annum. Said sum may be paid in equal installments over a period not to exceed twenty-four (24) months; provided, however, should such judge become eligible for county pension benefits before this amount is fully paid, the amount due the pension fund by such judge shall be deducted from such benefits at a rate to be determined by the pension board. Nothing in this section 901 shall be interpreted to mean that any current or former participant of this plan may opt out of participation in this plan after he has made his first contribution. When and if a judge or other officer, employee or deputy who is receiving or will receive payments of salary from DeKalb County and the State of Georgia (or any institution, bureau or department thereof) first becomes eligible to participate in this plan, that individual may make a one-time irrevocable election to opt out of participation in this plan, but may do so only before he makes his first contribution. 
Beginning as of June 26, 2013, the terms 'spouse' and 'surviving spouse' as those terms are used herein, mean the individual to whom a participant is lawfully married under the laws of any state or other jurisdiction where the marriage was performed, without regard to gender or the state of residence. 'Spouse' or 'surviving spouse' shall not include domestic partners or other similar relationships that do not satisfy a state or other jurisdictional requirement for a legal marriage.

(Acts 1962, p. 3088, § 6) 
Sec. 908. - Payment of benefits. 
(a)  Definitions: 
(1)  Compensation shall mean the actual compensation paid as salary to a participant by the county as herein provided during any calendar month, exclusive of overtime pay, reimbursed expenses, bonuses, commissions, and any other remuneration. Any increase in the annual compensation limit is effective as of January 1 of a calendar year and applies to any plan year beginning in that calendar year. Beginning after December 31, 1993, only the first one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00) of compensation shall be taken into account (and beginning January 1, 1995, such other amount as may be determined under IRC 401(a)(17)(B)). 
Beginning January 1, 2002, in no event shall the compensation of a participant taken into account under the plan for any plan year exceed the limitations of IRC Section 401(a)(17) in effect as of the beginning of the plan year (e.g., $250,000.00 for 2012). The limitations set forth herein shall be subject to adjustment as provided in IRC Section 401(a)(17)(B) and IRC Section 415(d); provided, however, that the dollar increase in effect on April 1 of each plan year, if any, is effective for that plan year. 
Compensation shall include contributions made to a qualified transportation plan, within the meaning of IRC Section 132(f) and before-tax or salary deferral contributions made under IRC Section 125, 401(k), 402(g)(3), 457(b) or 414(h) to this plan or any other plan maintained by DeKalb County. 
(2)  Group (or group of participants ) shall mean one of the following three (3) groups of participants: 
A.  Group 1 shall include those participants whose first day as a participant is before September 1, 2005;

C.  Group 3 shall include those participants whose first day as a participant is on or after January 1, 2016. 
(3)  Average compensation shall mean, for a group 1 or group 2 participant, the average of the participant's monthly compensation for the highest thirty-six (36) consecutive complete calendar months during the ten (10) years of service, or during the full period of service if less than ten (10) years, immediately preceding the date on which the participant's employment with the county terminates for any reason. Average compensation shall be determined by dividing the total compensation received by the participant during this thirty-six (36) complete calendar months-period by the number of months for which he received compensation in such period. When identifying the "ten (10) years of service" and the "highest thirty-six (36) consecutive complete calendar months" referenced above, any calendar month in which the compensation a participant received was reduced or eliminated because of an unpaid period at least fourteen consecutive days in length (or any portion of such an unpaid period) shall be disregarded as if that calendar month had not occurred; calendar months immediately preceding and following such disregarded calendar months shall be deemed consecutive. Compensation the participant received during any such disregarded calendar month(s) shall not be counted when calculating average compensation. The definition of average compensation shall be the same for a group 3 participant as for a group 1 or group 2 participant, except that the average compensation for a group 3 participant who continues working as an officer, employee, or deputy of DeKalb County after reaching thirty (30) years of service under this plan shall be calculated as if the participant's employment with the county had terminated when he reached thirty (30) years of service under this plan. 
(4)  Accrued benefit as of the date of determination shall mean the participant's monthly retirement benefit, equal to: 
A.  For group 1 participants, two and three-fourths (2¾) percent of the participant's average compensation multiplied by the participant's years of service, not to exceed a maximum monthly benefit of eighty-two and one-half (82½) percent of average compensation;

A.  For group 1 participants, simple interest at the rate of three (3) percent per annum for years prior to 1971, four (4) percent per annum for 1971 and subsequent years prior to 1981, and five and one-half (5½) percent per annum for 1981 and subsequent years; 
B.  For group 2 and group 3 participants, simple interest per annum at the rate defined by the Federal Reserve System H. 15, U.S. Treasury two-year constant maturities, prorated for each month of employment. Interest shall not exceed five and one-half (5½) percent per annum prorated for each month of employment. 
(6)  Years of service means service credited to participation in a pension plan of DeKalb County. This includes any period during which a participant qualifies for disability retirement benefits after January 1, 1981, as set forth in subsection (b)4.C. of this section 908. Accumulated sick leave at the time of retirement shall be credited at the rate of thirty (30) days for one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) year's service for retirement dates on or before May 30, 1996, and shall be credited at the rate of twenty-one and one-half (21½) days for one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) year's service for retirement dates after May 30, 1996. A participant who elects to return to employment as a DeKalb County officer, employee, or deputy after retirement under this plan shall receive service credit for a period of postretirement employment only if the participant made pension contributions during that period and had his benefits under this plan discontinued during that period. Years of service for which a participant shall have credit after a period of discontinuation of benefits shall include years of service prior the participant's original retirement, in addition to any service credited for postretirement employment. No service credit shall be given for any period of postretirement employment during which a participant received benefits under this plan and/or made no pension contributions. 
(7)  Actuarial equivalent shall mean a benefit calculated to be of equal value to the benefit otherwise payable when computed on the basis of the 1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table at seven (7) percent interest, factors prorated based upon seventy-five (75) percent males and twenty-five (25) percent females. For the purposes of calculating early retirement adjustments to IRC Section 415 limitations or for converting a benefit payable as an optional form of payment, the actuarial equivalent shall be computed based on the applicable interest rate and applicable mortality table as prescribed under IRC Section 415. 
(8)  Plan year shall mean the twelve-month period beginning each January 1 and ending on the following December 31, effective January 1, 2018. There shall be a short plan year from April 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017.

A participant shall be eligible to apply for disability retirement only if the participant is a current officer, employee, or deputy of DeKalb County and is: (i) a group 1 or group 2 participant with at least five (5) years of service; (ii) a group 3 participant with at least ten (10) years of service; or (iii) a group 1, 2, or 3 participant (regardless of service level) whose application for disability retirement is based on a disability incurred, while acting within the scope of his DeKalb County employment, due to an act of God or violent, external and accidental means not resulting from the participant's misconduct or provocation.

An eligible participant who qualifies for disability retirement shall, beginning on his disability retirement date, receive a monthly retirement benefit equal to fifty (50) percent (for a group 1 or group 2 participant) or twenty (20) percent (for a group 3 participant) of the participant's monthly rate of earnings as of the date last worked, minus any benefits received, including lump sum payments, and any benefit to be received through workers' compensation from DeKalb County, but the pension shall not be less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month. Beginning on the participant's disability retirement date, this monthly retirement benefit shall be payable on the first day of each month until it ceases upon the earliest of the following events: 
(i)  Cessation of the participant's total disability; 
(ii)  The participant's death; or 
(iii)  Recalculation of the participant's monthly retirement benefit at or after the normal retirement date as provided for below. 
D.  Transition from disability retirement benefit to normal retirement benefit. 
(i)  For group 1 and group 2 participants. If a group 1 or group 2 participant reaches his normal retirement date while receiving disability retirement benefits, he may elect to begin receiving normal retirement benefits instead of disability retirement benefits. If a participant makes this election, his benefit shall be recalculated in the same manner a normal retirement benefit is calculated, based upon the participant's average compensation as of his disability retirement date and years of service earned as of his normal retirement date. This recalculation may cause the participant's monthly benefit amount to increase or to decrease. When the participant elects to begin receiving normal retirement benefits, he may elect to receive benefits under one of the optional forms of payment described in subsection (b)(5) of this section 908. In the event that a group 1 or group 2 participant is still receiving disability retirement benefits at age sixty-five (65), the participant's monthly benefit shall automatically be recalculated in the same manner as a normal retirement benefit, based upon his average compensation as of his disability retirement date and years of service earned as of his normal retirement date, and the participant may elect to receive benefits under one of the optional forms of payment described in subsection (b)(5) of this section 908. However, when a group 1 or group 2 participant's benefit is automatically recalculated at age sixty-five (65), the participant's monthly retirement benefit shall not be reduced to an amount less than the monthly disability retirement benefit the participant was receiving immediately before age sixty-five (65), except to the extent such a reduction results solely from an election under subsection (b)(5) of this section 908. 
(ii)  For group 3 participants. If a group 3 participant is still receiving disability retirement benefits when he reaches age sixty-seven (67), his monthly benefit shall automatically be recalculated as a normal retirement benefit and he may elect to receive benefits under one of the optional forms of payment described in subsection (b)(5) of this section 908. However, the participant's monthly retirement benefit shall not be reduced to an amount that is less than the monthly disability retirement benefit the participant was receiving immediately before age sixty-seven (67), except to the extent such a reduction results solely from an election made under subsection (b)(5) of this section 908. 
E.  Requirement of post-offer, pre-employment physical. All individuals who receive offers of employment (which may be conditional offers) to become new officers, employees or deputies of DeKalb County under this plan shall undergo and complete a physical examination given by a physician chosen or approved by DeKalb County prior to the beginning of such employment, to determine whether they meet the minimum medical standards required to perform the essential functions of the offered job position (with reasonable accommodation if needed for a disability). 
(5)  [Optional retirement benefits.] 
A.  Election of optional retirement benefits. A participant may elect, or may revoke a previous election and make a new election, at any time six (6) months prior to his normal retirement date, early retirement date, or delayed retirement date, to have the benefit provided in subsection 1.B. of this section converted to one (1) of the options hereinafter set forth. Election of any option shall be made by the participant in writing. The one hundred twenty (120) months guaranteed payments provided in subsection 1.B. of this section is the normal form of payment for a normal, early or delayed retirement and shall be payable unless one of the following optional forms of payment is elected. Election of any option shall be made by the participant in writing. The benefit provided in subsection 1.A.(b) and 1.B. of this section 8 shall not be subject to election, but shall be payable only in the manner stated in said subsection 1.A.(b) and 1.B. 
B.  Description of options. The amount of any optional retirement benefit set forth below shall be the actuarial equivalent of the retirement benefit the participant would otherwise have been entitled to receive in accordance with paragraph 1.B. of this section, subject to the reduction in paragraph 3.B. of this section, if applicable. 
OPTION 1. Straight life benefit. This option provides an actuarially increased benefit which shall be payable during the lifetime of the participant with all payments ceasing at his death. 
OPTION 2. Joint and survivor benefit. This option provides an actuarially reduced benefit payable to the participant during his lifetime, with payments to continue after his death to his joint annuitant in an amount which is fifty (50) percent, sixty-six and two thirds (66 2/3 ) percent, seventy-five (75) percent or one hundred (100) percent of the participant's monthly retirement benefit, as elected by the participant upon his retirement, until the death of the joint annuitant. In the event the joint annuitant predeceases the retired participant, benefit payments shall cease upon the death of the participant. 
(6)  [Election under Option 2.] 
A.  Joint annuitant. A participant who elects Option 2 shall, on a form provided for that purpose, designate a person to receive the benefits which continue to be payable upon the death of the participant. Such person shall be the joint annuitant of the participant. 
B.  Cancellation of election. The election by a participant of Option 2 shall be null and void if either the participant or his designated joint annuitant shall die before benefits commence. In the event this election becomes null and void, the participant shall have the right to name another joint annuitant or elect another option in which instance the six (6) months' requirement of subsection 5.A. shall be waived. 
C.  Increase of benefit. In the event the joint annuitant predeceases the retired participant on or after the effective date of this ordinance, monthly benefit payments to the retired participant shall be increased thereafter to the benefit the participant would otherwise have been entitled to receive in accordance with paragraph 5.B. Option 1. of this section, subject to the reduction in paragraph 3.B. of this section, if applicable. Benefit payments shall cease upon the death of the participant. 
(7)  Termination benefit. 
A.  Termination benefit for participants who terminate employment on or before March 25, 1992. In the event of termination of employment within the first three (3) years of service, the participant's contributions will be returned without interest. Upon termination of employment after three (3) years of service but less than ten (10) years, the participant may either withdraw his contributions plus interest or leave his contributions in the fund and receive a monthly benefit to commence at age sixty-five (65) equal to the accrued benefit determined as of his date of termination. Upon termination of employment after the completion of ten (10) years of service the participant may either withdraw his contributions plus interest or leave his contributions in the fund and receive a monthly benefit to commence at his normal retirement date equal to the accrued benefit determined as of his date of termination; provided, however, such terminating employee may elect to commence receiving actuarially reduced benefits any time after he attains fifty (50) years of age. 
B.  Termination benefit for participants who terminate employment after March 25, 1992. 
(i)  For group 1 participants. In the event of termination of employment within the first three (3) years of service, the participant's contributions will be returned to the participant without interest within ninety (90) days of termination by means of a check mailed to the last known address of the participant or delivered by other means at the written request of the participant. Upon completing three (3) or more years of service, the participant is one hundred (100) percent vested in his benefit under the plan. In the event of termination of employment after three (3) or more years of service, the participant's contribution plus interest will be returned to the participant within ninety (90) days of termination by means of a check mailed to the last known address of the participant or delivered by other means at the written request of the participant, unless the participant, prior to the transmittal of such check, elects in writing to leave the contributions in the fund and to receive a monthly benefit to commence at a specific age after he becomes eligible to receive benefits. Except as provided in Section 15 of this Act regarding credit for prior service, any participant who receives a return of contributions shall be ineligible for a pension, except that in the case of a participant with three (3) or more years of service who receives an unrequested return of contributions, such participant may restore eligibility for a pension if, within sixty (60) days of receipt of same, the participant returns the full amount of the contributions and interest and provides to the pension board a written statement setting forth the date as of which the participant intends to retire. Any election of a date of intent to retire may be changed by the participant at any time by writing to the clerk of the pension board and expressing a revised date of intent to retire, subject to the provisions of this Act governing retirement dates. Expression of intent to retire confirms the participant's desire to leave contributions in the pension fund, and it shall not constitute an application for retirement. A refund of unforfeited contributions plus applicable interest may be requested at any time prior to the pension-eligible participant receiving monthly retirement benefits. 
(ii)  For group 2 and group 3 participants. The terms and conditions in [subsection] 7.B.(i) above shall apply to group 2 and group 3 participants, except that: 
(a)  In the event of termination of employment after at least three (3) but less than seven (7) years of service, the participant's contributions plus interest will be returned to the participant within ninety (90) days of termination by means of a check mailed to the last known address of the participant or delivered by other means at the written request of the participant; 
(b)  The participant is one hundred (100) percent vested in his benefit under the plan only after completing seven (7) or more years of service; 
(c)  In the event of termination of employment after at least seven (7) years of service, the participant's contributions plus interest will be returned to the participant within ninety (90) days of termination by means of a check mailed to the last known address of the participant or delivered by other means at the written request of the participant, unless the participant, prior to the transmittal of such check, elects in writing to leave the contributions in the fund and to receive a monthly benefit to commence at a specific age after he becomes eligible to receive benefits; and 
(d)  Except as provided in Section 15 of this Act regarding credit for prior service, any participant who receives a return of contributions shall be ineligible for a pension, except that in the case of a participant with seven (7) or more years of service who receives an unrequested return of contributions, such participant may restore eligibility for a pension if, within sixty (60) days of receipt of same, the participant returns the full amount of the contributions and interest and provides to the pension board a written statement setting forth the date as of which the participant intends to retire. 
C.  Payments over one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Effective as to distributions that occur on and after March 28, 2005, and notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary, if (1) the termination benefit pursuant to this section is more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), and (2) the participant does not affirmatively elect to receive the distribution directly or to have such distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan in accordance with the requirements of section 8 (section 908(b)(12) of this Appendix), then the plan will pay the distribution in a direct rollover to an individual retirement plan designated by the pension board that can account separately for taxable and non-taxable amounts. 
(8)  Death benefit. 
A.  Preretirement death benefit for group 1 participants. If a group 1 participant who has not retired dies prior to completing ten (10) years of service, his beneficiary shall receive a lump sum benefit equal to the participant's contributions plus interest. If a group 1 participant who has not retired dies after ten (10) years or more of service, the participant's beneficiary may elect to receive as a benefit one of the following forms of benefit, subject to the minimum distribution requirements in subsection (b)(11). The normal form in which this plan pays a participant's accrued benefit is a monthly benefit payable during the lifetime of the participant, with a minimum of one hundred twenty (120) guaranteed payments to the participant or his beneficiary. If a participant dies after ten (10) years or more of service but before receiving any portion of his accrued benefit, his beneficiary will receive a death benefit having an actuarial equivalent value equal to the one hundred twenty (120) guaranteed payments that would have been made to the deceased participant if he had survived and received payment(s) on the same date(s) as the beneficiary. Since the preretirement death benefit has an actuarial equivalent value equal to the deceased participant's one hundred twenty (120) guaranteed monthly payments, a beneficiary whose life expectancy is less than one hundred twenty (120) months will receive payments over a fewer number of months and in a greater monthly amount than a beneficiary whose life expectancy is at least one hundred twenty (120) months. 
i.  If the participant's beneficiary is the surviving spouse, the spouse may elect to receive either: 
I.  One hundred twenty (120) monthly payments (or fewer number of payments equal to the spouse's life expectancy) in an amount equal to the monthly payment the participant would have been entitled to receive had he qualified to take and had taken early retirement as of the date of his death, or if applicable in a greater monthly amount to take into account the fewer number of months of the spouse's life expectancy. The computation of such monthly benefit shall include, without limitation, the reduction applicable in computing early retirement benefits of one-eighth ( 1/8 ) of one (1) percent for each complete month, if any, by which his date of death precedes his normal retirement date. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to authorize early retirement for any participant under age fifty (50), or otherwise, except in strict accordance with the provisions of this section 8 [908 of this appendix] governing early retirement. 
II.  A joint and survivor benefit, as set forth in (b)5.B. of this section 8 [908 of this appendix], equal to one hundred (100) percent of the participant's monthly joint and survivor retirement benefit, deferred until the participant would have been eligible for early or normal retirement, and calculated as if the participant had retired the day before his death. If the participant dies before reaching the age of fifty-five (55), then the surviving spouse shall elect whether to receive normal or early retirement as set forth in [subsection] (b)3. of this section 8 [908 of this appendix]. If the surviving spouse elects early retirement, then the spouse will be entitled to the joint and survivor benefit if the participant had reached the age of fifty (50) or, if the participant died prior to reaching the age of fifty (50), when the participant would have attained the age of fifty (50). If the surviving spouse elects normal retirement, then the spouse will be entitled to the joint and survivor benefit when the participant would have attained the age of fifty-five (55). No payments will be made after the spouse dies. 
ii.  If the participant's beneficiary is not the surviving spouse, the beneficiary may elect to receive either: 
I.  A lump sum benefit in an amount equal to the actuarial present value of the one hundred twenty (120) guaranteed payments that would have been made to the deceased participant if he had survived, had been qualified to begin and had begun payments on the same date that the beneficiary receives the lump sum, which shall be paid no later than the end of the fifth year following the participant's year of death. If the participant died before he reached his early retirement date, the lump sum death benefit will be reduced using the reduction applicable in computing early retirement benefits for the period between the date he would have reached his early retirement date and the date he would have reached his normal retirement date, and reduced by an actuarial equivalent reduction for the period between the date the lump sum is paid and the date the participant would have reached his early retirement date. 
II.  One hundred twenty (120) monthly payments (or fewer number of payments equal to the spouse's life expectancy determined as of the first day of the year following the participant's year of death) in an amount equal to the monthly payment the participant would have been entitled to receive if he had survived, had been qualified to begin and had begun payments on the same date that the beneficiary begins the payments; payments will begin by the end of the calendar year following the participant's year of death. If the participant died before he reached his early retirement date, the monthly death benefit will be reduced using the reduction applicable in computing early retirement benefits for the period between the date he would have reached his early retirement date and the date he would have reached his normal retirement date, and reduced by an actuarial equivalent reduction for the period between the date monthly death benefits begin and the date the participant would have reached his early retirement date. Since the preretirement death benefit has an actuarial equivalent value equal to the deceased participant's one hundred twenty (120) guaranteed monthly payments, a beneficiary whose life expectancy is less than one hundred twenty (120) months will receive payments over a fewer number of months and in a greater monthly amount than would be received by a beneficiary whose life expectancy is at least one hundred twenty (120) months. 
The benefits described in this paragraph shall be in lieu of any termination benefit under this section 8 [908 of this appendix]. 
B.  Preretirement death benefit for group 2 and 3 participants. The death benefit for a group 2 or 3 participant shall be subject to the same terms and conditions in subparagraph (A) above, except that if the participant has not retired and dies after ten (10) years or more of service, the participant's beneficiary may elect to receive as a benefit one of the following: 
i.  If the participant's surviving spouse is the beneficiary, the spouse may elect to receive either: 
I.  One hundred twenty (120) monthly payments (or fewer number of payments equal to the spouse's life expectancy) in an amount equal to the monthly payment the participant would have been entitled to receive had he qualified to take and had taken early retirement as of the date of his death, or if applicable in a greater monthly amount to take into account the fewer number of months of the spouse's life expectancy. The computation of such monthly benefit shall include, without limitation, the reduction applicable in computing early retirement benefits of five-twelfths ( 5/12 ) of one percent for each complete month, if any, by which his date of death precedes his normal retirement date (if a group 2 participant) or thirteen forty-eighths ( 13/48 ) of one percent for each complete month, if any, by which his date of death precedes his normal retirement date (if a group 3 participant). Nothing contained herein shall be construed to authorize early retirement for any group 2 or group 3 participant under age fifty-five (55), or otherwise, except in strict accordance with the provisions of this section 8 [908 of this appendix] governing early retirement. 
II.  A joint and survivor benefit, as set forth in [subsection] (b)5.B. of this section 8 [908 of this appendix] equal to one hundred (100) percent of the participant's monthly joint and survivor retirement benefit, deferred until the participant would have been eligible for early or normal retirement and calculated as if the participant had retired the day before his death. If the participant dies before reaching his normal retirement date, then the surviving spouse shall elect whether to receive normal or early retirement as set forth in [subsection] (b)3. of this section 8 [908 of this appendix]. If the surviving spouse elects early retirement, then the spouse will be entitled to the joint and survivor benefit if the participant had reached the age of fifty-five (55) or, if the participant died prior to reaching the age of fifty-five (55), when the participant would have attained the age of fifty-five (55). If the surviving spouse elects normal retirement, then the spouse will be entitled to the joint and survivor benefit when the participant would have attained the age of sixty-two (62) (if a group 2 participant) or age sixty-seven (67) (if a group 3 participant). No payments will be made after the spouse dies. 
ii.  If the participant's beneficiary is not the surviving spouse, the plan will pay the death benefit in accordance with the rules described above in subsection (A)(ii). 
The benefits described in this paragraph shall be in lieu of any termination benefit under this section 8 [908 of this appendix]. 
C.  After retirement. If a participant has elected the straight life option, his beneficiary shall receive a lump sum benefit equal to the excess, if any, of the participant's contributions accumulated to his retirement date plus interest over the benefits actually paid to date of death. If a participant has elected any other form of payment, death benefits shall be payable as provided for by the provisions of the option elected, but in no event shall total benefits paid be less than the participant's contributions accumulated to his retirement date plus interest. 
(9)  Beneficiary. All participants shall, on a form provided for that purpose, designate a person or persons to receive the benefits payable in the event of the death of the participant. Such person or persons shall be the beneficiary of the participant. 
The participant may from time to time change the beneficiary by written notice to the pension board, and upon the receipt by the pension board of such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefit under this plan shall cease. In the event that any participant shall die without having designated a beneficiary or in the event that a participant shall die but the beneficiary designated by said participant shall fail to survive the participant, then and in either event, the person who shall constitute the beneficiary of the deceased participant shall be determined as follows: 
(a)  In the event the deceased participant is survived by his or her spouse, then such surviving spouse shall be the beneficiary; 
(b)  If the deceased participant is not survived by his or her spouse then the beneficiary shall be the deceased participant's estate. 
(10)  Maximum benefits. 
A.  Benefits with respect to a participant may not exceed the maximum benefits specified under Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code for governmental plans. This section does not constitute an election under Section 415(b)(10)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
B.  General rule. The annual benefit under this plan payable to a participant at any time shall not exceed the maximum permissible amount. "Maximum permissible amount" shall mean the amount specified in IRC, Section 415(b), as adjusted automatically by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue from time to time, with each new limitation to apply to limitation years ending within the calendar year of the date of the adjustment. 
If the annual benefit commences before age sixty-two (62) or after age sixty-five (65), the maximum permissible amount shall be determined under IRC Section 415 and regulations and rulings thereunder. If the annual benefit commences when the participant has less than ten (10) years of participation in this plan or any predecessor plan to this plan, the maximum permissible amount as defined above shall be reduced by one-tenth ( 1/10 ) for each year less than ten (10) in accordance with applicable regulations. 
C.  Incorporation by reference. The limits described in subsection A. above shall be applied under the terms of IRC Section 415 and the regulations thereunder, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. For purposes of applying such limitations, the following optional provisions shall apply: 
(a)  The limitation year shall be the calendar year. 
(b)  A year of service for purposes of calculating a participant's average compensation shall be the calendar year. 
(c)  "Compensation" shall mean a participant's earned income, wages, salaries, and fees for professional services, and other amounts received for personal services actually rendered in the course of employment as a DeKalb County officer, employee or deputy excluding the following: 
(1)  Employer contributions to a plan of deferred compensation that are not included in the employee's gross income for the taxable year in which contributed or employer contributions under a simplified employee pension plan to the extent such contributions are deductible by the employee, or any distributions from a plan of deferred compensation; 
(2)  Other amounts which receive special tax benefits; and 
(3)  Amounts that do not satisfy the timing rules set forth in the regulations under IRC Section 415. 
Compensation for any limitation year is the compensation actually paid or includable in gross income during such year. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, compensation shall include any elective deferral (as defined in IRC Section 402(g)(3)) and any amount that is contributed or deferred by the employer at the election of the employee and which is not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of IRC Section 125 or 457. In addition, compensation shall be increased by the amount by which the participant's compensation is reduced by salary reduction or similar arrangement under Section 132(f)(4) (i.e., a qualified transportation fringe benefit program). 
The annual compensation taken into account shall not exceed the limitations of IRC Section 401(a)(17) in effect as of the beginning of the plan year in which it is paid. 
(d)  Amounts that would otherwise constitute "compensation" above but are paid from a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan sponsored by the employer nevertheless shall constitute "compensation" for purposes of the limitations in IRC Section 415 in the year in which such amounts are actually received by the participant, but only to the extent such amounts are includible in the participant's gross income. 
(e)  The following amounts also shall constitute "compensation" under [subsection] (c) above if (i) the amounts are paid by the later of two and one-half (2½) months after the participant's severance from employment with the employer or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the participant's severance from employment, and (ii) the amounts would have constituted compensation under [subsection] (c) above if they were paid prior to the participant's severance from employment with the employer: 
(1)  Payment for unused accrued bona fide annual leave or other leave, but only if the participant would have been able to use the leave if employment had continued; and 
(2)  Amounts received by a participant pursuant to a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan, but only if the payment would have been paid to the participant at the same time if the participant had continued in employment with the employer and only to the extent that the payment is includible in the participant's gross income. 
(11)  Minimum distribution requirements. 
A.  Benefit payments under this plan must begin by the later of April 1 of the calendar year following the year in which the participant reaches age seventy and one-half (70½) or retires from active employment. The participant's entire interest in the plan must be distributed over the life of the participant or the lives of the participant and a designated beneficiary, over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the participant or the life expectancy of the participant and designated beneficiary. 
When a participant dies after distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the participant's interest shall be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution prior to the participant's death. 
When a participant dies before distribution of benefits has begun, the entire interest of the participant shall be distributed within five (5) years of the participant's death. The five-year payment rule does not apply to any portion of the participant's interest which is payable to a designated beneficiary over a period not greater than the life or life expectancy of the beneficiary and which begins within one (1) year after the date of the participant's death. The five-year payment rule does not apply to any portion of the participant's interest which is payable to a surviving spouse over the life or life expectancy of the spouse which begins no later than the date the participant would have reached age seventy and one-half (70½). 
B.  [Rules for determination.] The rules set forth in this subsection B shall apply for purposes of determining the required minimum distribution to participants and designated beneficiaries (as defined below) for calendar years beginning on and after January 1, 2003, even if, in the case of a designated beneficiary, the participant died before 2003. 
(a)  No extension of death benefits or payment forms. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to extend any death benefit or permit any beneficiary designation or payment form not otherwise provided or permitted under this plan. This subsection shall, instead, be deemed to limit and modify any provision of this plan to the extent that such limitation or modification is necessary to ensure that the plan complies with a good faith interpretation of IRC Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder. 
(b)  Form of distribution. For a participant who is employed by DeKalb County after age seventy and one-half (70½), any distribution payable under this subsection may be paid in any optional form of benefit that is available under the plan, provided that all consent requirements under the plan are satisfied. Any form of distribution payable under this plan, however, must satisfy the following requirements: 
(i)  The distribution must be in the form of a periodic annuity for the participant's life, or for the joint life expectancy of the participant and designated beneficiary or over a period certain that does not exceed the maximum length of the period certain determined under the Treasury Regulations. 
(ii)  The interval between payments must be uniform over the entire distribution period and must not exceed one (1) year. 
(iii)  If payments have commenced over a period certain, the period certain may not be changed. 
(iv)  Distributions in the form of a life annuity must satisfy the minimum distribution incidental benefit (MDIB) requirement of IRC Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6, A-2, or any successor regulation thereto. 
(v)  All payments, either in the form of a life annuity or over a period certain must either be nonincreasing or increase only in accordance with the rules set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6, A-1. 
For purposes of this subsection, references to a life annuity shall include an annuity for the joint life expectancy of the participant and the designated beneficiary. 
(c)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the participant's required minimum distribution date (or, if the participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin) is the payment that is required for one (1) payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the participant's required minimum distribution date. 
(d)  Lump sum distributions. In the case of a lump sum distribution from this plan that is distributed in or after the calendar year in which the participant attains or would have attained age seventy and one-half (70½), the amount of the lump sum that equals the participant's or designated beneficiary's required minimum distribution and is not an eligible rollover distribution, shall be determined using either of the methods set forth in the regulations. The pension board shall have the sole discretion to elect the calculation method but shall apply the same method to all lump sum distributions made in the same calendar year. 
(e)  Incidental death benefit requirement. Any optional form of benefit elected by the participant or designated beneficiary must comply with the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of IRC Section 401(a)(9)(G). This rule insures that the retirement benefits payable under the plan are more than incidental. If the participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a nonspouse beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the participant's required minimum distribution date to the designated beneficiary after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of Section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the Treasury Regulations. 
(f)  Actuarial increase after age seventy and one-half (70½). 
(1)  A participant's accrued benefit shall be actuarially increased to take into account the period after age seventy and one-half (70½) in which the employee does not receive any benefits under the plan. The actuarial increase shall commence on April 1 following the calendar year in which the employee attains age seventy and one-half (70½), and end on the date on which benefits commence after retirement in an amount sufficient to satisfy IRC Section 401(a)(9). 
The accrued benefit payable to such a participant as of the end of the period for which the actuarial increase is required shall not be less than: 
(i)  The actuarial equivalent of the employee's accrued benefit as of April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the participant attained age seventy and one-half (70½); plus 
(ii)  The actuarial equivalent of any additional benefits accrued after the date described in [subsection] (i) above; less 
(iii)  The actuarial equivalent of any distributions made with respect to the participant's accrued benefit after such date. 
(2)  The actuarial increase described above may reduce the benefit accrual otherwise required under IRC Section 41 l(b)(1)(H)(i). 
(3)  The actuarial adjustment described above shall be made even during a period for which benefits are suspended. 
(g)  Board discretion. The pension board shall have discretion to apply the provisions of this subsection to any benefit option elected by the participant to the extent necessary to avoid violating IRC Section 401(a)(9). The pension board may, for example, modify a participant's selection of an optional form of benefit to satisfy the incidental death benefit requirement by requiring that the participant select another form of benefit or another contingent annuitant, or by modifying the form of benefit so it complies with the applicable rules. 
(h)  Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this subsection, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary. 
(i)  Designated beneficiary. The term "designated beneficiary" shall be determined in accordance with the definition of "beneficiary" in the regulations, notwithstanding that this definition may be different from that set forth elsewhere in this plan, provided that any individual who is a designated beneficiary must also be a beneficiary (but not necessarily all of the beneficiaries) as defined in this plan. Each beneficiary, as defined in the plan, however, need not be a designated beneficiary in the event, for example, that a beneficiary disclaims his interest under this plan. 
(ii)  Spouse. "Spouse" shall mean "spouse" as defined in the regulations. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed, however, to extend any death benefit or permit any beneficiary designation or payment form not otherwise provided or permitted under this plan. 
(iii)  Regulations. "Regulations" shall refer to the Treasury Regulations (including temporary regulations) promulgated under IRC Section 401(a)(9), as set forth in Treasury Regulations 1.401(a)(9)-1 through 1.401(a)(9)-6T, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS in the form of revenue rulings, notices, other regulations and other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin or any successor thereto. 
(iv)  Distribution calendar year. "Distribution calendar year" is a calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year that contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin. 
(v)  Life expectancy. "Life expectancy" shall mean the period computed by the use of the Single Life Table in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the regulations. 
(12)  Direct rollover of eligible rollover distributions. Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary, that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the plan administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(a)  Definitions. 
(1)  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. 
(2)  Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in IRC Section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in IRC Section 408(b), an annuity plan described in IRC Section 403(a), a qualified trust described in IRC Section 401(a), an annuity contract described in IRC Section 403(b), and an eligible plan under IRC Section 457(b) that is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state that agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan, provided that such account, annuity, contract, plan or trust accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. Effective January 1, 2008, eligible retirement plan shall include a Roth IRA established under IRC Section 408A. 
(3)  Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO), as defined in Section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. For distributions on and after January 1, 2007, a "distributee" includes a non-spouse beneficiary if the eligible rollover distribution is made to an individual retirement plan that is treated as an inherited individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity in accordance with IRC Section 402(c)(11). 
(4)  Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(b)  Special rules for rollovers of after-tax contributions. To the extent that an eligible rollover distribution includes amounts that are not includible in gross income, such an amount shall constitute an eligible rollover distribution to the extent that (i) it is transferred in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to a qualified trust or to an annuity contract described in IRC Section 403(b), and such trust or contract provides for separate accounting for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution that is not so includible, or (ii) such portion is transferred to an individual retirement account described in IRC Section 408(a) or an individual retirement annuity described in IRC Section 408(b) (other than an endowment contract). 
Effective January 1, 1988, the pension board will consider an adjustment to retirement benefits not less than on an annual basis, and will make a formal determination as to whether such adjustment should be granted. Consideration of any such adjustment will be made only in conjunction with information furnished in an annual actuarial report as provided in section 11 of this act [§ 911 of this appendix]. Nothing contained herein is to be construed as making any benefit adjustment automatic or mandatory in nature. In making such determination, the pension board will take into account the information contained in the annual actuarial report and any other policy issues regarding total retirement benefits or the pension plan in general. No adjustment will be made which would adversely affect the financial soundness of the plan without first making provision for any additional contributions necessary to retain financial soundness. 
Forfeiture of contributions and benefits. Subject to the requirement for the giving of notice as set forth herein, a terminated participant's contributions plus interest shall be forfeited to the pension fund on the date (the "forfeiture date") which is seven (7) years after the last to occur of the following: (i) date of termination of the participant's employment with the county, (ii) date of issuance of a subsequently uncashed or undeliverable and unclaimed check refunding such contributions and interest, (iii) as to a participant with three (3) years or more of service, the first date as of which the participant is or becomes eligible for a retirement benefit under this plan, or (iv) the participant's expressed date of intent to retire which is in accordance with the provisions of this Act and is on file with the clerk of the pension board as of the time the determination with regard to forfeiture is made; provided, however, that a participant's contributions plus interest shall not be deemed abandoned if, within the applicable seven-year period, the participant has accepted a distribution from the pension fund, corresponded in writing concerning such contributions or interest, or otherwise indicated an interest as evidenced by a memorandum or other record on file with the clerk of the pension board; and provided, further that contributions and interest of a participant shall not be deemed forfeited unless the pension board sends written notice to the participant, not less than thirty (30) days following any forfeiture date, advising the participant of the applicable provisions of this section, and the participant fails, within thirty (30) days following the giving of such notice, to correspond in writing to the board concerning such contributions or interest, or otherwise expresses to the board an interest therein. Such notice from the board shall be sent by first class mail to the last known address of the participant as shown on the records of the board, but need not be sent if the address of the participant is shown by the board's records to be inaccurate or if the amount of contributions and interest involved is less than fifty dollars ($50.00). Any eligible participant or beneficiary who applies for a pension benefit later than the first date of eligibility shall forfeit to the pension fund all monthly benefits to which he or she would have been entitled prior to the first day of the month following the actual date of application for a pension. Any participant whose contributions are actually abandoned and paid over to the State of Georgia or another state in accordance with any provision of law shall be ineligible to thereafter receive pension benefits under the plan. Terminated employees who forfeit contributions and interest shall retain eligibility for the same monthly pension benefits for which they were eligible prior to the forfeiture, if any, but they shall be ineligible to withdraw contributions or interest.

Editor's note— Section 7 of Ord. No. 92-42, adopted Dec. 22, 1992, which added this paragraph, provided that the provisions are effective retroactive to Sept. 1, 1992. 
Effective for monthly benefits payable, on or after the effective date of this amendment [December 23, 2004], monthly benefits payable to officers, deputies, and employees who have retired or become disabled (including surviving pension beneficiaries and joint annuitants) and who were, as of the date of adoption of this amendment, receiving pensions from DeKalb County under this ordinance or under the pension plan provided under Georgia Laws 1949, page 415, as amended, or under the pension plan provided by Georgia Laws 1953, page 3198, as amended, shall be increased by an amount equal to three (3) percent of such person's retirement benefit otherwise payable with respect to the effective date of this amendment [December 23, 2004].

(b)  Retirement incentives. 
(1)  1996 retirement incentive. A participant who has attained age fifty (50) and less than age fifty-five (55), and who has completed at least twenty-five (25) years of service, and who retires with an early retirement date between September 1, 1996 and November 1, 1996 (inclusive) shall receive an immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall be an amount computed and payable in accordance with subsection 3.B. of this section 8, with no deduction for each complete month by which the date the benefit commences precedes the normal retirement date of the participant. 
(2)  2010 retirement incentives. 
A.  2010 early-out incentive. A participant shall receive the retirement opportunity and incentive referred to herein as the "2010 early-out incentive" only if the participant: is a current DeKalb County officer, employee, or deputy as of May 30, 2010; completes at least twenty-five (25) years of credited service as of May 31, 2010; is less than fifty (50) years of age on May 31, 2010; submits to the director of finance a fully completed and executed 2010 retirement incentive application and waiver/release between March 2 and April 16, 2010; allows that waiver/release to become effective and enforceable; and elects to retire with a retirement date of May 31, 2010. A participant who satisfies all these criteria and requirements for the 2010 early-out incentive shall receive an immediate monthly retirement benefit in an amount that is computed and payable in the same manner as a normal retirement benefit in accordance with subsection (b)1.B. of this section 8 [908], with no deduction for each complete month by which the date the benefit commences precedes the participant's normal retirement date. A participant who satisfies all criteria and requirements for the 2010 early-out incentive shall also receive, after his retirement date, a lump sum retirement benefit from the pension fund in an amount equal to the net value of the participant's unused accumulated annual leave (up to sixty (60) days) at his regular rate of pay. Because a participant who satisfies all criteria and requirements for the 2010 early-out incentive shall receive, from the pension fund, the retirement benefit described in the previous sentence, such a participant shall not be eligible to receive payment from any other source for any amount of unused accumulated annual leave. Some participants who are eligible to receive the 2010 early-out incentive may be deemed "key employees" because their retirement on May 31, 2010, would cause a substantial business hardship for the county. The chief executive officer or another elected county officer may defer the retirement date of a key employee under his supervision for up to three (3) months after May 31, 2010, if that key employee agrees in writing, before May 31, 2010, to accept the deferred retirement date. A key employee who agrees to accept a deferred retirement date shall not be paid any retirement benefit under this paragraph until after his deferred retirement date. 
B.  2010 retirement-plus incentive. A participant shall receive the retirement opportunity and incentive package referred to herein as the "2010 retirement-plus incentive" only if the participant: is a current DeKalb County officer, employee, or deputy as of May 30, 2010; completes at least eight (8) years of credited service as of May 31, 2010; reaches the age of fifty (50) years on or before May 31, 2010; submits to the director of finance a fully completed and executed 2010 retirement incentive application and waiver/release between March 2 and April 16, 2010; allows that waiver/release to become effective and enforceable; and elects to retire with a retirement date of May 31, 2010. A participant who satisfies all these criteria and requirements for the 2010 retirement-plus incentive shall receive an immediate monthly retirement benefit in an amount that is computed and payable in the same manner as a normal retirement benefit in accordance with subsection (b)1.B. of this section 8 [908], with no deduction for each complete month by which the date the benefit commences precedes the participant's normal retirement date, and with two (2) years of service added to the participant's credited years of service for the purpose of calculating the participant's benefit under subsection (b)1.B. of this section 8 [908], except that the two (2) added years of service shall not increase the participant's credited years of service to a total higher than thirty (30) years. A participant who satisfies all criteria and requirements for the 2010 retirement-plus incentive may, in his timely-submitted 2010 retirement incentive application, elect to receive zero (0) percent, ten (10) percent, or twenty-five (25) percent of the actuarial present value of the total retirement benefit described above in this paragraph as a lump sum payment in 2010; however, if such a participant receives ten (10) percent or twenty-five (25) percent of the actuarial present value of that retirement benefit as a lump sum payment in 2010, then the participant's monthly retirement benefit amount shall be reduced based on the ten (10) percent or twenty-five (25) percent reduction in the actuarial present value of the amount remaining to be paid out to the participant. A participant who satisfies all criteria and requirements for the 2010 retirement-plus incentive shall also receive, after his retirement date, a lump sum retirement benefit from the pension fund in an amount equal to the net value of the participant's unused accumulated annual leave (up to sixty (60) days) at his regular rate of pay, plus one of the following two (2) amounts, whichever is larger: the net value of twenty-five (25) days of annual leave at the participant's regular rate of pay, or fifty (50) percent of the net value of the participant's unused accumulated annual leave (up to sixty (60) days) at his regular rate of pay. Because a participant who satisfies all criteria and requirements for the 2010 retirement-plus incentive shall receive, from the pension fund, the retirement benefit described in the previous sentence, such a participant shall not be eligible to receive payment from any other source for any amount of unused accumulated annual leave. Some participants who are eligible to receive the 2010 retirement-plus incentive may be deemed "key employees" because their retirement on May 31, 2010, would cause a substantial business hardship for the county. The chief executive officer or another elected county officer may defer the retirement date of a key employee under his supervision for up to three (3) months after May 31, 2010, if that key employee agrees in writing, before May 31, 2010, to accept the deferred retirement date. A key employee who agrees to accept a deferred retirement date shall not be paid any retirement benefit under this paragraph until after his deferred retirement date. 
C.  Funding. DeKalb County will fund the actuarially amortized amount of the total lump sum retirement benefits that are based on annual leave calculations, including the interest thereon, and that are paid to participants in the pension fund who retire pursuant to the 2010 retirement incentives described in paragraphs A. and B. of this subsection.

Sec. 911. - Same—Appropriation; employment of actuary. 
Commencing January 1, 1996, the governing authority in charge of county affairs for DeKalb County shall appropriate to the pension fund annually, to be paid in monthly installments, an amount equal to three and one-quarter (3.25) percentum of the amount of monthly compensation of each participant in this pension system. After forty (40) years of accreditable service under pension service no further contributions to the pension plan shall be made by DeKalb County on behalf of the employee. 
Within sixty (60) days prior to the end of the first one-year period next following the effective date of this act [article], it shall be the duty of the governing authority of DeKalb County to employ some qualified actuary or firm of actuaries to analyze the DeKalb County pension plan and report thereon to the pension board. Should such report reveal that the contribution plan herein provided to be made by DeKalb County be insufficient to maintain the plan on a sound basis, it shall be the duty of such governing authority of DeKalb County to appropriate such further sums for the next one (1) year as would be necessary to maintain the fund and the plan on a sound financial basis. Should the actuary or firm of actuaries find that a lesser contribution to DeKalb County would maintain the fund and plan on a sound financial basis, DeKalb County is authorized to decrease its contribution to the percentage of the total payroll of the participants found by the actuary or firm of actuaries to be sufficient to maintain the plan and the fund on such sound financial basis. The pension plan shall be actuarially reviewed each one (1) year thereafter and adjustments made as set out herein if such adjustments are found to be necessary, and the actuary or firm of actuaries employed to make such analyses shall be selected by the pension board.

Sec. 912. - Participation of persons who did not choose to participate at inception of pension plan. 
Any officer, employee or deputy who chose not to participate in this pension plan at its inception on July 12, 1962, may become a participant by: 
(1)  Authorizing deductions to be made from his earnings on the basis set out herein for participants with his "years of service" to begin on the first day of the month immediately following this authorization, and his participation subject to all the provisions of this plan. 
(2)  If he has uninterrupted county service since July 12, 1962, and is not a participant in any other retirement program excepting social security or a State of Georgia program, and desires to receive credit as a participant for all or any designated number of consecutive years last passed, he may pay into the pension fund the same amount he would have contributed plus the amount the county would have contributed plus three (3) percentum simple interest on the total for each year he desires credit, said contributions to be based on his pay scale at the time the contribution would have been made had he been a participant. The privilege of any such participant to purchase credit for past years of service shall be exercised on or before April 1, 1971, and shall be under the same terms and conditions set out in section 6 of this chapter [§ 907 of this appendix] giving said terms the definitions of this 1970 amendment.

Editor's note— The ordinances and resolutions shown in the left-hand column below may be found in the acts as shown in the right-hand column below: 

 
Sec. 913. - Disability pension—Definition; filing of physicians' certificates; hearing. 
Effective January 1, 1981, a participant shall be totally disabled for purposes of determining his eligibility retirement under section 8 [§ 908 of this appendix] and other matters related to this pension plan if the participant is in a continuous state of incapacity due to illness or injury which: 
(a)  While it continues during the first twelve (12) months of incapacity prevents the participant from performing the duties of his normal occupation with the county; and 
(b)  While it continues thereafter, prevents the participant from engaging in any occupation for which he is or becomes reasonably qualified by education, training or experience. 
Whenever an application for disability pension has been filed, the applicant shall submit therewith a signed certificate from a licensed, practicing physician of Georgia certifying to the total disability of such applicant for a pension. Immediately thereupon the pension board shall order the applicant to be examined by the county physician or some other physician named by the board who likewise shall certify the physical ability or total disability of the applicant. In the event the certificates of the respective physicians shall generally agree upon total disability, such facts shall be conclusive as to the physical or mental condition of the applicant and the board shall thereupon enter an order granting a pension in the proper amount. In the event the certificate tendered by the applicant and the certification of the county physician appointed by the board shall disagree as to the condition of the applicant, the pension board shall consider both opinions and render a decision. If the pension board denies the application, the participant may request a hearing before the pension board. Such hearing shall be conducted informally by the examination of witnesses for and in opposition to such application who shall be sworn, and both the applicant and pension board may be represented by legal counsel if they so desire. Copies of documents may be received as evidence in lieu of the original at the discretion of the board, and affidavits shall be filed with the board at the time of the hearing. The decision of the board after a hearing shall be final as to the physical or mental condition of the applicant, but the proceeding shall be subject to review by writ of certiorari from the superior court of DeKalb County. The chairman of the pension board shall be authorized to acknowledge service on any such writ, and to answer same on behalf of the pension board.

Sec. 914. - Same—Annual review. 
The pension board shall have the right, at intervals of not less than one (1) year, to require an examination of all participants receiving disability pensions under the provisions of this act [article]. In the event any such participant receiving disability pension shall be found, as a result of such examination, not to be disabled, the pension board may, after hearing evidence thereon, and an opportunity to such participant to be heard, remove such participant from the list of those entitled to disability pension. Provided, however, that in the event such participant receiving disability benefits refuses to submit to a physical examination after thirty (30) days' notice to report for such examination, the pension board shall withhold payments of his benefits until he submits to such examination and the participant shall be deemed to have forfeited his benefits during the time of his refusal to submit to a physical examination.

(Acts 1962, p. 3088, § 14) 
Sec. 915.1. - Credit for prior service. 
Any participant in the plan herein who shall return to the service of DeKalb County after an absence therefrom, whether under resignation, leave of absence or discharge, shall be entitled to credit against his service for all periods of time he has served as an officer or employee, or as a deputy of an officer of DeKalb County, provided such participant shall restore to the pension fund all sums which he may have withdrawn therefrom on the date of his resignation or discharge from county service, together with interest thereon at the rate of three (3) percent per annum.

Sec. 918. - Credit for military service. 
Any participant who shall have served in the armed forces of the United States during World War I or World War II or the Korean War and who, at the time of induction into said armed forces, was an officer, employee or deputy of DeKalb County, shall be entitled to have credit against his service with said county all of the time represented by the period of said service. Any participant who shall hereafter be inducted into the armed forces of the United States by conscription or under any compulsory military plan, shall likewise be entitled to credit for service during the period he was absent from county service and in the armed forces of the United States; provided such employee shall, within six (6) months after his discharge from the armed service, return to the service of DeKalb County, and pay to the pension fund a sum equal to the amount of the contribution which said participant would have made to the pension fund had he continued in the county service and had not been inducted into the armed forces of the United States, such payment to be made in not more than twelve (12) equal monthly installments. Should a participant under this section become eligible for benefits before this amount is fully paid in, the amount due the pension fund shall be deducted from such benefits at a rate to be determined by the board. Military service shall not be construed to interrupt continuous service. 
(a)  The plan will grant continuous service for a period of military service in accordance with the requirements of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), O.C.G.A. § 38-2-279(f), and any other related federal or state laws, to a participant who was a current DeKalb County officer, employee or deputy when such military service commenced and who satisfies all terms and conditions to obtain such continuous service under one (1) or more of those laws, and will grant the participant an accrued benefit for such a period of military service if and to the extent that the participant or his beneficiary or estate makes up any required participant contributions as provided below. Such a participant, or the beneficiary or estate of a deceased participant, shall have the right to make up the participant's missed contributions and thereby receive an accrued benefit for a period equal to the participant's period of military service, up to the maximum number of years permitted under applicable laws. The participant, beneficiary or estate must notify the pension board of the desire to repay the missed participant contributions. 
(b)  A participant seeking to exercise a legal right to make up required participant contributions to obtain an accrued benefit for a period of military service shall make such contributions either in one (1) lump sum payment or in installments paid during a period that ends no longer than five (5) years after the period of military service ends. If the participant died during the period of military service, a beneficiary or legal representative of the participant's estate seeking to exercise a legal right to make up required participant contributions to obtain an accrued benefit for the participant's period of military service shall make such contributions no later than one (1) year following proof of the participant's death. Make-up contributions for participants who are reemployed by the county after military service may be deducted from the participant's salary or other compensation on a pre-tax basis. 
(c)  The amount of participant contributions required to obtain an accrued benefit for a period of military service shall be the amount of contributions that the participant would have been required to make during that period of military service if he had been continuously employed with the county during that period, calculated using the participant contribution rate(s) that were applicable during that period and the pay rate(s) the employee would have received during that period. If the determination of said pay rate(s) is not reasonably certain, the pay rate used to calculate the amount of participant contributions to be paid shall be the participant's average rate of compensation during the twelve-month period (or period of county employment, if shorter) immediately preceding his military service. 
(d)  To the extent required or permitted by applicable law, a participant shall be required to inform the county in writing before entering military service in order to be eligible for continuing service as described above.

Sec. 933. - Effect of working for DeKalb County after retirement under this plan. 
(a)  Limits on county employment while receiving benefits under this plan. No participant shall receive any benefits from this plan while receiving salary or wages as an officer, employee or deputy of DeKalb County, except that after August 31, 2010, a participant may, after retirement under this plan, work as a merit-exempt, part-time officer, employee or deputy of the county without any discontinuation of the participant's benefits under this plan, subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  Limit on hours of postretirement employment in a calendar year. 
(A)  If a participant exceeds one thousand forty (1,040) hours of postretirement county employment in calendar year 2010, 2011, or 2012, the participant's benefits under this plan shall be discontinued for the remainder of each such calendar year in which the participant exceeds the one-thousand-forty-hour-limit, beginning with the month after the participant exceeds that limit. 
(B)  If a participant exceeds four hundred sixteen (416) hours of postretirement county employment in any calendar year after 2012, the participant's benefits under this plan shall be discontinued for the remainder of that calendar year, beginning with the month after the participant exceeds the four-hundred-sixteen-hour limit. 
(2)  Limit on postretirement county salary and/or wages in a calendar year. 
(A)  If a participant earns postretirement county salary and/or wages in calendar year 2010, 2011 or 2012 that exceed fifty (50) percent of the participant's last preretirement annual base salary from the county, the participant's benefits under this plan shall be discontinued for the remainder of each such calendar year in which the participant's county salary and/or wages exceed that limit, beginning with the month after the participant's postretirement county salary and/or wages exceed that limit.

(4)  If a participant receives health insurance, life insurance, paid sick leave and/or paid annual leave that is paid for or subsidized by DeKalb County because of any postretirement employment, the participant's benefits under this plan shall be discontinued during the period in which the participant receives such insurance and/or leave. 
(5)  In any calendar year (after 2011) that begins after a participant has reached the age of sixty-two (62) years, the restrictions in subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section 933(a) shall not apply to that participant. However, if a participant over age sixty-two (62) at the beginning of a calendar year (after 2011) earns postretirement county salary and/or wages in that calendar year that exceed the larger of the two (2) amounts described in [subsections] (A) and (B) below, the participant's benefits under this plan shall be discontinued for the remainder of that calendar year, beginning with the month after the participant's postretirement county salary and/or wages for the calendar year exceed the larger of the following two (2) amounts: 
(A)  The amount equal to the county salary and/or wages the participant earned during the participant's last full calendar year of preretirement county employment (excluding any payout for unused annual leave) minus twelve (12) months of the participant's monthly retirement benefit as calculated under this plan for the current calendar year; or 
(B)  The amount that equals fifty (50) percent of the participant's last preretirement annual base salary from the county. 
Pension contributions shall be deducted from a participant's salary or wages during any period(s) of postretirement employment as a DeKalb County officer, employee or deputy when the participant's benefits under this plan are discontinued for any reason.

(e)  Monthly retirement benefit upon later retirement not reduced because of return to work. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, returning to work as a DeKalb County officer, employee, or deputy after retirement under this plan shall not cause a participant to receive, upon any later retirement under this plan, a monthly retirement benefit that is less than the actuarial equivalent of the monthly retirement benefit the participant was entitled to receive at the time of his earlier retirement under this plan, using the actuarial factors in effect on the date of the later retirement.

Sec. 1130. - Power of the zoning board of appeals.

( H.N. Ord. of 8-25-2015, Pt. I ) 
Sec. 1131. - Appeals to the zoning board of appeals. 
(a)  General power . The zoning board of appeals shall have the power and duty to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that there is error in any final order, requirement, or decision made by an administrative official based on or made in the enforcement of the county's zoning ordinance, or as otherwise authorized by applicable law. Administrative officials must make final decisions covered by this section within one hundred eighty (180) days of receipt of all necessary information to make such decision. A failure to act prior to the passage of one hundred eighty (180) days shall not be construed to be a final order, requirement or decision within the meaning of this division. If a decision is not made by the 181st day, the requested decision is deemed denied, and becomes appealable. 
(b)  Appeals of decisions of administrative officials . Appeals of decisions of administrative officials may be filed by (1) any person aggrieved by; (2) any elected member of the DeKalb County Governing Authority affected by; or (3) any owner of property within two hundred fifty (250) feet of the nearest property line of the property, that is the subject of any final order, requirement, or decision of an administrative official, based on or made in the enforcement of the county's zoning ordinance, by filing with the secretary of the zoning board of appeals an application for appeal, specifying the grounds thereof, within fifteen (15) days after the action was taken by the official that is the subject of the appeal. 
(c)  Testimony and burden of proof. The standards and requirements of this zoning ordinance and decisions made by public officials are presumed to be valid and just. It shall be the responsibility of any applicant seeking relief to assume the burden of proof and rebut this presumption by presenting sufficient facts and evidence to explain how the proposed appeal or variance is consistent with the general spirit and intent of this zoning ordinance and the comprehensive plan. 
(d)  Review . It is the duty of the zoning board of appeals to review such facts and evidence in light of the intent of the county's zoning ordinance to balance the public health, safety, and general welfare against the injury to a specific applicant that would result from the strict application of the provisions of the county's zoning ordinance to the applicant's property. 
(e)  Appeal stays all legal proceedings . An appeal of a decision of an administrative official stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action or decision appealed from unless the official from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the zoning board of appeals, after notice of appeal has been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in that official's opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such a case, legal proceedings shall be stayed only pursuant to a restraining order granted by a court of competent jurisdiction directed to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown. 
(f)  Appeal stays land disturbance or construction activity in certain situations . If the action or decision appealed from permits land disturbance or construction activity to commence or continue on residentially zoned property, the appeal stays the land disturbance or construction activity until the zoning board of appeals issues a decision on the appeal. Thereafter, land disturbance or construction activity in such cases shall only be stayed by an order from a court of competent jurisdiction. In all cases involving non-residentially zoned property, the appeal to the zoning board of appeals does not stay land disturbance or construction activity; such activity shall only be stayed by an order from a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(g)  Time of hearing . The zoning board of appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal and give notice thereof pursuant to the applicable requirements of law as well as written notice to the appellant. Any party may appear at the hearing in person, by an agent, by an attorney, or by the submission of written documentation. 
(h)  Decision of the zoning board of appeals . Following the consideration of all testimony, documentary evidence, and matters of record, the zoning board of appeals shall make a determination on each appeal and shall issue a written decision explaining the reasons for its decision. The zoning board of appeals shall decide the appeal within a reasonable time, but in no event more than sixty (60) days from the date of the hearing. An appeal shall be sustained only upon an expressed finding by the zoning board of appeals that the administrative official's action was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact, that the administrative official erroneously applied the county's zoning ordinance to the facts, or that the administrative official acted in an arbitrary manner. In exercising its powers, the zoning board of appeals may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and to that end shall have all the powers of the administrative official from whom the appeal was taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit, provided all requirements imposed by any applicable laws are met. 
( H.N. Ord. of 8-25-2015, Pt. I ) 
Sec. 1132. - Applications for variances; and criteria to be used by the zoning board of appeals in deciding applications for variances. 
(a)  The zoning board of appeals shall hear and decide applications for variances from the strict application of the regulations of the county's zoning ordinance and chapter 21 of the Code of DeKalb County, as Revised 1988, where the strict application of any regulation enacted under said chapters would result in exceptional and undue hardship upon the owner of such property. In determining whether or not to grant a variance, the zoning board of appeals shall apply the criteria specified in this section to the facts of each case. The zoning board of appeals may attach reasonable conditions to any approved variance in accordance with applicable law. Once imposed, conditions shall become an integral part of the approved variance and shall be enforced as such. No changes to an approved condition attached to a variance shall be authorized except by re-application to the zoning board of appeals in full compliance with the applicable provisions of this division. No relief may be granted or action taken under the terms of this division unless such relief can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without substantial impairment of the intent and purpose of the county's zoning ordinance and the comprehensive plan. The zoning board of appeals shall apply the following criteria to the types of applications specified below as follows: 
(1)  Variances from the provisions or requirements of the county's zoning ordinance other than variances described in section 27-7.5.4 of the county's zoning ordinance shall be authorized only upon making all of the following findings in writing: 
a.  By reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific lot, or by reason of exceptional topographic and other site conditions (such as, but not limited to, floodplain, major stand of trees, steep slope), which were not created by the owner or applicant, the strict application of the requirements of the county's zoning ordinance would deprive the property owner of rights and privileges enjoyed by other property owners in the same zoning district. 
b.  The requested variance does not go beyond the minimum necessary to afford relief, and does not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the zoning district in which the subject property is located. 
c.  The grant of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the zoning district in which the subject property is located. 
d.  The literal interpretation and strict application of the applicable provisions or requirements of the county's zoning ordinance would cause undue and unnecessary hardship. 
e.  The requested variance would be consistent with the spirit and purpose of the county's zoning ordinance and the DeKalb County Comprehensive Plan text. 
(b)  Fair Housing Act Accommodation Variance. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the zoning board of appeals may grant a variance to the limitations of the county's zoning ordinance that might have a discriminatory impact on a handicapped person, as that term is defined in the Federal Fair Housing Act, including but not limited to sections 27-4.2.41 and 27-4.2.48 of the county's zoning ordinance as well as the terms defined therein. A Fair Housing Act Accommodation Variance shall be issued if the applicant for such a variance shows a documented need for accommodation based on medical or scientific studies, that the requested accommodation is the minimum necessary variance from the restrictions of the Code, that the requested accommodation does not impose an undue burden or expense on the county or its citizens, and that the requested accommodation does not effectively create a fundamental alteration of the existing zoning scheme. An application for a Fair Housing Act Accommodation Variance shall comply with all other procedural requirements for consideration and approval of variances in this division. 
( H.N. Ord. of 8-25-2015, Pt. I ) 
Sec. 1133. - Limitations of authority of the zoning board of appeals. 
No variance shall be granted by the zoning board of appeals to: 
(1)  Allow a structure or use not listed as a permitted use or a special use in the applicable zoning district or a density of development that is not authorized within such district. This prohibition does not apply to any variance from the supplemental regulations of article IV of the county's zoning ordinance or from any other accessory feature or characteristic of a permitted or special use, unless said variance is otherwise prohibited by the regulations of the county's zoning ordinance. 
(2)  Allow any variance which conflicts with or changes any requirement enacted as a condition of zoning or of a special land use permit by the board of commissioners. 
(3)  Reduce, waive, or modify in any manner the minimum lot width unless the purpose is to reverse a lot merger. 
(4)  Reduce, waive, or modify in any manner the minimum lot area established by the county's zoning ordinance. 
(5)  Extend the time period for a temporary outdoor social, religious, entertainment, or recreation activity approved by the director of planning. 
(6)  Permit the expansion or enlargement of any nonconforming use of land, nonconforming use of land and buildings in combination, nonconforming use of land and structures in combination, or nonconforming use requiring special land use permit. 
(7)  Permit the reestablishment of any nonconforming use of land, nonconforming use of land and buildings in combination, nonconforming use of land and structures in combination, or nonconforming use requiring special land use permit where such use has lapsed pursuant to the requirements and limitations of article VIII of the county's zoning ordinance. 
(8)  Permit customer contact for a home occupation authorized by the county's zoning ordinance. 
(9)  Allow any variance to increase the height of a building which will result in adding a story.

Sec. 1134. - Decision by the zoning board of appeals. 
Each application presented to the zoning board of appeals regarding a variance shall be scheduled for a public hearing within sixty (60) days of the filing of a complete application and shall be supported by findings and conclusions which shall be a part of the record established by the zoning board of appeals for each application. The zoning board of appeals shall grant or deny the variance in writing. In its written variance decision, the zoning board of appeals must include findings of fact citing evidence of compliance with all applicable criteria imposed by this chapter or other applicable provisions of law. The zoning board of appeals may adopt the findings of fact of the staff or the applicant; may adopt the findings of fact of the staff or applicant with modifications; or may adopt a separate set of facts developed by the zoning board of appeals. In such case that an application to the zoning board of appeals is initiated due to an existing violation of the county's zoning ordinance and such application is denied, the violation shall be required to be corrected within thirty (30) days of such denial or as specified by the zoning board of appeals if a greater time period is required. The maximum extension of time the zoning board of appeals may grant for correction shall be ninety (90) days. 
( H.N. Ord. of 8-25-2015, Pt. I ) 
Sec. 1135. - Appeals of final decisions of the zoning board of appeals. 
Only persons aggrieved by a final decision of the zoning board of appeals may seek review of such decision by petitioning the Superior Court of DeKalb County by writ of mandamus, setting forth plainly the alleged errors. Such petition shall be filed within thirty (30) days after the final decision of the zoning board of appeals is rendered. "Aggrieved Person" means a person who either: (a) is the applicant or the owner of property that is the subject of an application or a decision by a county administrative official; (b) has a substantial interest in an action appealed from and is in danger of suffering special damage or injury not common to all property owners similarly situated; or (c) is a member of the governing authority of DeKalb County, as that term is defined in section 1 of the Organizational Act of DeKalb County, in whose district the subject property is located and whose substantial interest is his/her responsibility to insure faithful administration of the law.

A violation of any ordinance or resolution adopted pursuant to the provisions of this act [division] is hereby declared to be a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished as provided by law. In case any building or structure is or is proposed to be erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, converted, or maintained, or any building, structure or land is or is proposed to be used in violation of any ordinance or resolution adopted pursuant to this act [division], the building inspector, county attorney, or other appropriate authority of the county or any adjacent or neighboring property owner who would be especially damaged by such violation may, in addition to other remedies, institute injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance or use, or to correct or abate such violation, or to prevent the occupancy of said building, structure, or land. Each and every day such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance, or use continues shall be deemed a separate offense. The owner of any buildings or premises or parts thereof, where anything in violation of the county's zoning ordinance exists, and any architect, builder, contractor or any other agent of the owner, or any tenant, who commits or assists in the commission of any violation, shall be guilty of a separate offense.

(c)  One (1) board member shall be elected by majority vote of the electors present and voting at the caucus, on the basis of one (1) vote for each elector. Such board member shall be elected to a term of office of two (2) years at the initial caucus of electors when the board is first formed and to terms of office of four (4) years thereafter.

If the boundaries of a district or municipality are subsequently changed after creation of a district to include land within the unincorporated area of DeKalb County and the district originally had no land within the unincorporated area of DeKalb County, the governing authority of DeKalb County shall acquire the right to appoint a member to the board of the district upon entering into the cooperation agreement provided for in section 9 of this act [section 1284 of this division].

Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall not exceed five (5) mills of the aggregate assessed value of all such real property. The taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be equitably apportioned among the properties subject to such taxes, fees, and assessments according to the need for governmental services and facilities created by the degree of density of development of each such property.

(3)  The adoption of a resolution consenting to the annexation by the board of the district; and 
(4)  The adoption of a resolution consenting to the annexation by the governing authority of DeKalb County, if any portion of the district is or is to be in the unincorporated area of DeKalb County, and such municipalities as may have area within the district before or after the annexation.

Sec. 1283. - Debt. 
Each district may incur debt without regard to the requirements of Section V of Article IX of the Constitution of Georgia, or any other provision of law prohibiting or restricting the borrowing of money or the creation of debt by political subdivisions of the State of Georgia, which debt shall be backed by the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the district but shall not be an obligation of the State of Georgia or any other unit of government of the State of Georgia other than the district. 
(Acts 1999, p. 4786, § 8) 
Sec. 1284. - Cooperation with local governments. 
The services and facilities provided pursuant to this act [division] shall be provided for in a cooperation agreement executed jointly by the board and the governing bodies of DeKalb County and any municipalities within which the district is partly located. The provisions of this section shall in no way limit the authority of DeKalb County or any such municipality to provide services or facilities within the district; and DeKalb County or such municipalities shall retain full and complete authority and control over any of their facilities located within their respective areas of any district. Such control shall include but not be limited to the modification of, access to, and degree and type of services provided through or by facilities of the municipality or county.

(c)  Issuance by a board of one (1) or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one (1) or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds, notes, or other obligations in connection with the same project or with any other projects; but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations are issued shall recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds, notes, or other obligations, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the board to issue subsequent bonds, notes or other obligations on a parity with such prior issue. 
(d)  In the event that any district shall be terminated in accordance with this Act, the board shall serve until December 31 of the year in which termination shall be approved for the purpose of concluding any ongoing matters and projects, but, if such cannot be concluded by December 31, then the governing authority of the county shall assume the duties of the administrative board and shall be expressly authorized to exercise the authority of the administrative board.
