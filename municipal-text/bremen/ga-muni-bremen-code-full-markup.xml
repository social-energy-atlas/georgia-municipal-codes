         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Bremen, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1996 Code, as supplemented through December 12, 2005, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1996 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Mollie M. Garrett, Code Attorney, and Paula Freeman, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

                  The publisher is most grateful to Sam D. Price, Esq. and Mr. Perry Hicks for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

                  (a)  When the purchasing agent determines, in writing, that the use of the competitive sealed bid is either not practical or not advantageous to the city, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposal.

                  (2)  When the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with subsequent maintenance and service capabilities and what priorities should be given these requirements in the city's best interest;

                  (1)  Proposals shall be requested by advertisement in a newspaper having general circulation in the city.

                  (2)  Proposals shall be sealed. All proposals shall be received in public and the purchasing manager shall make or oversee the making of a record of the proposals received.

                  (4)  As provided in the invitation for proposals, the purchasing agent may require the successful proposer to furnish a performance bond to secure the faithful performance of all of the terms of the contract. The performance bond shall be in a form approved by the city attorney and the form of the bond shall be included in the specifications. The city council may reject the bond of any proposer if they find it to be unacceptable. 
                  (5)  All contracts in excess of $100,001.00 to which this section applies shall be in writing and shall be approved by the city council. The city council may reject any and all proposals.

                  The multistep competitive sealed procurement method may be used when the city desires to award a contract not necessarily based on price, and when specifications may not be readily available or when technical qualifications are essential for the decision making process. This type shall take the form of request for proposals or request for information and shall follow the following format. If time is of the essence, the two steps can be combined with the priced offer submitted in a separate sealed envelope at the time of submission of the technical offer. The pricing data is to remain unopened until evaluation of technical offers is complete. 
                  (1)  The solicitation shall be advertised in a newspaper having general circulation in the city. The advertisement shall state the time and place where documents may be obtained, and the time and place for deadline for receipt of the proposal, unless otherwise directed by the city council. At least 14 full days must pass between the day the advertisement appears and the day of the deadline for receipt of documents.

                  (2)  The initial step shall consist of solicitation of technical offers with no costs or prices included. Unweighted evaluation criteria shall be included in the solicitation documents. A team consisting of not less than three persons shall evaluate the results of this solicitation. This team shall include the purchasing agent, the head of the user department, and an additional representative of the user department selected by the respective department head. Evaluation shall follow the same criteria as under request for proposals. 
                  (3)  In the second step, those who submitted technical offers deemed responsible and responsive in the initial step are then asked to submit price bids. 
                  (4)  Proposals shall be sealed. All proposals shall be publicly opened and the purchasing agent shall make or oversee the making of a record of the proposals received. The record and the proposals received shall be subject to public inspection after the proposal opening in the manner prescribed by law. 
                  (5)  Award of proposal shall be made to the bidder that submits the lowest responsible and responsive proposal that meets the specifications contained in the proposal documents and is in the city's best interest. The city reserves the right to make award if a single proposal is received. 
                  (6)  If required by the soliciting documents, the purchasing agent may require the successful contracting party to furnish a payment and performance bond to secure the faithful performance of all of the terms of the contract. The payment and performance bond shall be in a form approved by the city attorney and the form of the bond shall be included in the specifications. 
                  (7)  All contracts of $50,000.00 or more to which this section applies shall be in writing and shall be approved by the city council. The city council may reject any and all bids.

                  (a)  Any party that submits a bid pursuant to this article and has a good faith basis to protest the bid, must prepare a formal complaint to be filed with the city manager. The complaint shall specify the alleged act or omission by the city that provides the basis for the complaint. 
                  (b)  Upon the filing of a complaint and if requested by either party, the city manager shall have a hearing on the complaint and decide the merits of the claim. The city manager is empowered to decide that the contract at issue be voided, upheld, or whatever other relief may be necessary. The city council shall approve or reject the city manager's decision. 
                  (c)  If the party bringing the complaint disagrees with the conclusions of the city council, the decision may be appealed to the county superior court.

                  (a)  All using agencies shall submit to the purchasing agent, at such times and in such form as he shall prescribe, reports showing stocks of all supplies which are no longer used or which have become obsolete, worn out or scrapped. 
                  (b)  The purchasing agent shall have the authority to transfer surplus stock to other using agencies. 
                  (c)  The purchasing agent shall have the authority to sell all supplies which have become unsuitable for public use, or to exchange the same for, or trade in the same on, new supplies, upon approval of the city manager.

Bacon, and S.J.T., Inc. v. Richmond County, and Goldrush II, v. City of Marietta, in order to avoid the effects of criminal interests and negative effects on the community by the decreased safety and welfare of the city's citizens, the hindering of commercial growth in the city, and the deterioration of the city's economic base.

At this hearing the burden of proof shall be upon the applicants seeking the discontinuance of the distance waiver to show a significant impact to the peace, safety or general welfare of the applicants which is a direct result of the distance waiver permit resulting from the original grant of the waiver and that said impact to the applicants is not the result of one or more of the applicants moving into the distance waiver area since the date of the original grant of waiver. Hearing on the application for reconsideration and denial of the distance waiver shall proceed in the same manner as outlined in subsection (l)(2) of this section.

The minimum distance requirements from church buildings shall not apply to space in a shopping center used for church purposes. Excluded hereunder is a private dwelling that has been unoccupied for at least 12 months immediately prior to the application being filed. It is intended that this distance restriction be supplemental to the requirement of O.C.G.A. § 3-3-21(a)(1)(B).

At such time as the license for this premises is revoked, not renewed or is allowed to lapse, or a new license is not applied for and granted for the location within 60 days of the expiration or termination of the previous license, this subsection (d) and the prohibitions herein shall apply to any new application for that location. 
                  (5)  After issuance of a license, no change in the location of the building or walls can be made that affects distance requirements so that the distance requirement would not be satisfied as a result of the change. Unless a distance waiver variance has been granted for a restaurant, the distance requirements must be met at all times during the term of the license.

                  (g)  Failure to open. All holders of licenses issued hereunder must, within 60 days after the issuance of such license, open for business the establishment referred to in the license. Failure to open the licensed establishment as referred to within such period shall serve as a forfeiture and cancellation of the unused license and no refund of the license fee shall be made to the license holder.

                  DIVISION 5. - ADULT BUSINESSES 

                  Sec. 8-140. - Purpose. 
                  The purpose of this division is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition because several court decisions have held that to do so would unlawfully cause to vanish what the courts have declared to be a constitutionally protected form of expression. As to adult erotic dance establishments, this division represents a balancing of competing interests, reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

                  (3)  Where a business subject to the occupation tax for the calendar year has been conducted for only a part of the preceding year, the amount of gross receipts for such part shall be reported in said return. Said return shall also show a figure putting the receipts for such part of a year on an annual basis with the part-year receipts bearing the same ratio to the whole-year gross receipts as the part year bears to the whole year. Said figure shall be used as the estimate of the gross receipts of the business for the current calendar year in establishing the business tax liability. 
                  Sec. 8-198. - Option to report gross receipts by range. 
                  (a)  Instead of reporting actual gross receipts as provided in section 8-197(a) above, the owner, proprietor, manager, or executive officer of the business liable for said occupation tax levied for the year may elect to file with the city clerk, on a form furnished by the city clerk, a signed return, on or before January 15, designating that business's range of gross receipts, rather than actual gross receipts.

                  (1)  If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of said tax provided for in this article, is less than the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by said business based on the estimate filed pursuant to this article, the difference in said amount shall be due and payable by the taxpayer to the city on February 28 of the current year and delinquent if not paid on or before said date. 
                  (2)  If the amount of the occupation tax for the preceding year based on the return provided for in this section and on the rate of said tax provided for in this article, exceeds the amount of occupation tax theretofore paid by said business based on the estimate filed pursuant to this article, the difference in said amount shall be refundable by the city to the taxpayer; or, if said business continues to be conducted in the city during the current year, such difference in amount may be credited by the city on the amount of occupation tax to be paid to the city by said business for the current year.

                  Sec. 8-201. - Returns confidential. 
                  Except in the case of judicial proceedings or other proceedings necessary to collect the occupation tax hereby levied, it shall be unlawful for any officer, employee, agent, or clerk of the city, or any other person to divulge or make known in any manner the amount of gross receipts or any particulars set forth or disclosed in any occupation tax return required under this article.

In the case of those practitioners where the local government cannot suspend the right of the practitioner to conduct business, the imposition of civil penalties shall be permitted and pursued by the local government in the case of delinquent occupation tax. These penalties may consist of either a percentage of the amount due or a flat line fee. 
                  Sec. 8-205. - Lien taken for delinquent occupation tax.

The lien of said occupation tax shall become fixed on and date from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the marshal or other appropriate officer of the city upon the property of defendant located in said jurisdiction, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of said execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by the Code, charter of said city, and the laws of the state, and the defendant in said execution shall have rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the applicable laws in regard to tax executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the city against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of the nulla bona. If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution is issued pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him as though he had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes. 
                  Sec. 8-206. - Public hearings regarding use of additional revenue. 
                  In any year when revenue from occupation taxes is greater than revenue from occupation taxes for the preceding year, the council shall hold one or more public hearings as a part of the process of determining how to use the additional revenue.

                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 16-1. - Conditions constituting a nuisance. 
                  A nuisance shall be shown to exist by evidence that either of the following circumstances exist: 
                  (1)  By evidence that any person has created or maintained an instrumentality, agency or condition upon his premises that results in hurt, inconvenience or damage to others, or tends to the immediate annoyance of the citizens in general, is manifestly injurious to the public health or safety, or tends to corrupt the manners or morals of the people, or any considerable portion thereof. Proof that an owner or occupant of a residential building, structure or property is utilizing the premises of such residential property for the open storage of any abandoned motor vehicle, icebox, refrigerator, stove, glass, building material, building rubbish or similar items shall evidence the fact that the person is maintaining his property in such a manner as to tend to the immediate annoyance of the citizens in general; or 
                  (2)  By evidence that any person has created or maintained an instrumentality, agency or condition upon his premises or in or near a public place, which may prove detrimental to children, or which may reasonably be apprehended to be a source of danger to children, whether in a building, on the premises of a building, or upon an unoccupied lot. Such person is under a duty to take such precautions as a reasonably prudent man would take to prevent injury to children of tender years whom he knows to be accustomed to resort there or, who may, by reason of something there which may be expected to attract them, come there to play. For purposes of this subsection, such an attractive nuisance includes any abandoned wells, shafts, basements or excavations; abandoned refrigerators and motor vehicles; any structurally unsound fences or structures; or any lumber, trash, fences, debris or vegetation which may prove a hazard for inquisitive minors.

                  Sec. 16-26. - Specific noise nuisances. 
                  (a)  The following standards shall apply to the activities or sources of sound set forth below: 
                  (1)  Music and amplified sound. 
                  a.  No property owner, tenant or an agent or employee of a property owner shall employ any device or instrument at an entertainment venue that creates, or amplifies sound to generate any sound for the purpose of communication or entertainment that is plainly audible at a receiving residential property, including but not limited to: any loudspeaker; bullhorn; amplifier; public address system; musical instrument; radio; or device that plays recorded music. 
                  b.  At the sole discretion of a law enforcement officer or code enforcement officer and as an alternative to making a determination of whether a sound is plainly audible, the following shall apply: A sound pressure level (SPL) reading may be taken at the receiving residential property according to the sound measurement procedures contained herein. In no instance shall the SPL from any entertainment venue music or amplified sound source exceed the following absolute limits except as prescribed herein: 
                  TABLE 1 

                   
                  Provided however, that under no circumstance shall the existence of this SPL standard prevent a violation being found if the sound is plainly audible as set forth in subsection (a)(1)a of this section. 
                  c.  In cases where the receiving residential property background sound levels dBA or dBC exceed the levels in table 1, in no instance shall the sound pressure level from any entertainment venue amplified sound source exceed the receiving residential property background sound level, except as prescribed herein. 
                  d.  Insofar as practicable, sound shall be measured while the amplified sound of interest under investigation is operating at normal, routine conditions and, as necessary, at other conditions, including but not limited to, design, maximum, and fluctuating rates. When measurements cannot be conducted at or within the residential property boundary, they shall be made as close thereto as is reasonable. Sound pressure levels shall be measured using the A- and C- weighting networks on a sound level meter (SLM) meeting, at a minimum, the tolerance characteristics for a Type 2 device as established within ANSI S1.4 or an equivalent standard. All measurements shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures: 
                  1.  Only during periods when the sound pressure level from sound sources unrelated to the sound of interest dominate the measurement location; 
                  2.  For a period of time sufficient to ensure that the measured sound pressure levels are typical of the sound of interest, but in no event shall the duration of measurement be less than one minute; 
                  3.  Only during periods when wind speeds (including gusts) are no greater than 15 miles per hour; 
                  4.  Never under any condition that allows the SLM to become wet; and 
                  5.  Only after the SLM has undergone a field calibration process or method as recommended by the SLM manufacturer. 
                  e.  The limitations imposed in this section do not apply to a person participating in a parade, athletic event, public assembly, or outdoor special event; provided that an administrative permit has been issued, if required, and the person is in compliance with the permit and any other provisions or city policies, including policies related to activities in city parks. 
                  f.  The limitations imposed in this section do not apply to sound by public safety vehicles, emergency signaling devices, or authorized public safety personnel for the purpose of alerting persons to the existence of an emergency or emergency work.

                  (d)  Issuance of fi. fa. The clerk is hereby authorized to issue a fi. fa. for execution and levy to satisfy the amount of any tax, penalty or interest due but not paid under the provisions of this article.

                  Sec. 24-159. - Findings and intent. 
                  This division is adopted to address the interest of public safety. Motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices and other similar vehicles are not designed or manufactured to be used on public highways, streets and roads, (hereafter "public roads") and the city in no way advocates their operation on the public roads within its jurisdiction. Adoption of the ordinance from which this division is derived is not to be relied upon as a determination by the city that operation of motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, low-speed vehicles, and other similar vehicles on public roads is safe or advisable if done in accordance with this division.

                  Sec. 100-9. - Determination of potential conflict of interest. 
                  (a)  Prior to any hearing on an application made pursuant to the land development code, the planning and zoning commission, city council and mayor shall review the summary of any application scheduled to be brought before them and make a personal determination as to whether he or she has any of the following potential conflicts in the zoning decision making process with respect to the property or the applicant in question. The questions each individual official must ask themselves is: 
                  (1)  Do I have a property interest in any real property affected by the proposed rezoning action? 
                  (2)  Do I have a financial interest in any business entity which has a property interest in any real property affected by the proposed rezoning action? 
                  (3)  Do I have a member of my immediate family that has a property or financial interest in any real property affected by the proposed rezoning action? 
                  (b)  In the event an individual official answers "yes" to any of the above-listed questions, said official shall immediately disclose the nature and extent of such interest to the secretary of the commission for the planning and zoning commission, or to the city clerk for the mayor and council. The secretary of the commission, or the city clerk, as the case may be, shall record said disclosure in the records of the commission or council, as applicable for inclusion in the minutes of the hearing at which the issue is presented. An official that has an interest as defined in subsections (a)(1) and (2) of this section shall disqualify himself from voting on the rezoning action. Henceforth, the disqualified official shall not take any action to influence the decision on the application for rezoning. In the event disqualifications of one or more of the members of the commission or the council result in the inability to obtain a quorum for the purpose of making a final decision on the rezoning matter, the governing authority shall immediately petition either the superior court for Carroll County or Haralson County (depending upon the location of the property in question) for the appointment of a special master to hear the application and render a decision on the issue presented in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-5. 
                  (Ord. of 8-18-2014, § 99.14.20(3)) 
                  Sec. 100-10. - Hearings on zoning decisions; notice. 
                  (a)  The planning and zoning commission review shall consist of two hearings which shall be noticed pursuant to the notice requirements provided in O.C.G.A. § 36-66-4. 
                  (1)  The first hearing is to officially recognize the proposed amendment and place said amendment on the agenda and is known as a first reading. At the first reading of the application discussion of the application may be held by the planning and zoning commission, and the planning and zoning commission may instruct the zoning enforcement officer to request additional information of the applicant for consideration at the public hearing on the application; however, no vote on the application or the merits thereof shall be held or taken during this initial reading. 
                  (2)  The second hearing, known as a second reading, shall be a public hearing following published notice, at which hearing the planning and zoning commission will review and discuss the application and have the opportunity to take and receive information from the applicant and others speaking on behalf of the application and take comments from those in the general public who desire to speak in opposition to the amendment proposed by the application. The applicant is encouraged to meet with the owners of properties lying adjacent to the property in question that may be directly affected by the proposed amendment change and also with others expressing an opposition to the proposed amendment in an effort to clarify its application, to resolve misunderstandings and differences prior to the public hearing; however, such a meeting is not mandatory. 
                  (b)  An application for rezoning may be withdrawn by the applicant, without penalty, so long as a written request to withdraw the application is received by the codes enforcement officer, or the planning and zoning commission, prior to the start of the planning and zoning commission's public hearing on the application. During the initial public hearing before the planning and zoning commission, the applicant may request that the issue presented in the application be tabled until a date certain for the obtaining and submission of additional information to the commission for its consideration prior to the commission making its decision to recommend approval or denial of the application. Subsequent to the completion of the hearing on the application by the planning and zoning commission, the application may be withdrawn by written request of the applicant delivered to the codes enforcement officer not less than 24 hours prior to the public hearing on the application by the mayor and city council; however, the applicant shall not be allowed to resubmit its application for consideration for an amendment to the land development code (to the same zoning classification as previous submitted) for a period of 90 days after the date of the withdrawal. Any request by the applicant to withdraw its application within the 24 hours prior to the public hearing by the mayor and city council and before the zoning decision on the application is made by the council shall be solely in the discretion of the mayor and council. 
                  (c)  Within its allotted review period, the planning and zoning commission shall submit a recommendation to the mayor and city council that recommends an approval or a denial of the rezoning application. Before the mayor and city council render its decision to accept or reject a rezoning application, it shall hold a public hearing on the issue presented by the application. At the public hearing the mayor and city council shall receive and consider the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission, but the council is in no way bound to follow the recommendations of the planning and zoning commission. The mayor and city council shall take a vote on the application for rezoning upon the completion of the public hearing, to either: 
                  (1)  Approve the application; 
                  (2)  Deny the application; or 
                  (3)  Accept the application subject to stipulations. 
                  The mayor and city council may vote to table the zoning decision until a date certain, but only with the consent of the applicant. The applicant may demand a vote on a decision either for or against the application at the hearing. 
                  (d)  Posting notice of rezoning petition. 
                  (1)  At least 15 days prior to the second reading before the planning and zoning commission, signs shall be posted on the property notifying interested persons that a rezoning petition has been filed. Failure to post or maintain the notice shall not, however, invalidate the actions taken. 
                  (2)  Zoning decisions initiated by the planning and zoning commission or the mayor and city council shall require a public hearing on the proposed action; notice of said hearing to be published in the legal organ of either Haralson County or Carroll County (depending upon the situs of the property in question) at minimum of 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the date of the hearing. The notice shall state the time, place, and purpose of the hearing. 
                  (3)  In addition, notice that an application for amendment to rezone a tract of property shall be given by first-class mail to all readily identifiable property owners holding recorded title to adjacent properties at the addresses for said adjacent property owners as shown on the tax records of the respective county wherein the property is situated. Said notice shall be deemed sufficient when deposited in the U.S. Post Office. 
                  (4)  A sign shall be posted on the property. Said sign shall be placed within ten feet of the right-of-way upon which the property fronts and shall be plainly visible from said roadway. In the event the property fronts both sides of a public road, a sign shall be placed on both sides of said roadway. Where the property borders more than one public right-of-way, a sign shall be posted on all contiguous rights-of-way. 
                  (5)  Where property does not front on an existing public right-of-way, the sign shall be placed on the right-of-way of the public road (which in the estimation of the codes enforcement officer) is closest to the subject property. The sign shall, in addition to the information set out in subsection (6) of this section, include a reference to the present map and parcel number of the property. 
                  (6)  The sign shall include the following: 
                  a.  Notice of rezoning hearing; 
                  b.  Date, time, and location of hearing; 
                  c.  Present zoning; 
                  d.  New zoning proposed by the application; 
                  e.  Property map; 
                  f.  Name of applicant; 
                  g.  Name and telephone number of a city official or staff member from whom additional information may be obtained. 
                  (e)  The following procedures shall apply to all amendment hearings: 
                  (1)  At all hearings a quorum of the planning and zoning commission or mayor and city councilmembers shall be present. 
                  (2)  All hearings shall be open to the public. 
                  (3)  At any hearing the analysis submitted by the initiating party, if any, shall be reviewed, along with the record prepared by the planning and zoning commission. The review of such analysis and records at such hearing or meeting shall consist, as a minimum, of a statement of the finding with respect to each matter enumerated in subsection (f) of this section, or the written presentation of such finding to the members of the mayor and city council together with a limited supply of copies of such finding to be available at the hearing or meeting and available on request to interested members of the public. 
                  (4)  The procedures for conducting public zoning hearings as adopted by the city council shall apply for all public hearings to include hearings before boards and commissions of the city. 
                  (5)  All decisions shall be by a majority vote. 
                  (6)  Transcripts, if desired, shall be the responsibility of the applicant. 
                  (f)  The planning and zoning commission in making its review, investigations, and recommendations, and the mayor and city council in rendering its zoning decision shall, at all times, endeavor to reach decisions which balance the interest of promoting the public health, safety, morality, and general welfare of the city against the constitutionally protected rights of the property owner to the unrestricted use of his property. The planning and zoning commission shall investigate and make a recommendation with respect to certain required matters. The planning and zoning commission shall make a written record of its investigation and recommendations, and this record shall be a public record. The planning and zoning commission shall address each of the enumerated matters set out below and make a recommendation with respect to each of said matters. The matters with which the planning and zoning commission shall be required to make such investigation and recommendation shall be: 
                  (1)  Compatibility with adjacent uses and districts. Existing uses and use districts of surrounding and nearby properties, and whether the proposed use district is suitable in light of such existing uses and use districts of surrounding and nearby properties, and whether the proposal will materially and adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby properties. 
                  (2)  Property value. The existing value of the property contained in the petition under the existing use district classification, the extent to which the property value of the subject property is diminished by the existing use district classification, and whether the subject property has a viable and reasonable economic use under the current use district. 
                  (3)  Suitability. The suitability of the subject property under the existing use district classification, and the suitability of the subject property under the proposed use district classification of the property. 
                  (4)  Vacancy and marketing. The length of time the property has been vacant or unused as currently used under the current use district classification; and any efforts taken by the property owner to use the property or sell the property under the existing use district classification. 
                  (5)  Evidence of need. The amount of undeveloped land in the general area affected which has the same use district classification as the map change requested. It shall be the duty of the applicant to carry the burden of proof that the proposed application promotes public health, safety, morality or general welfare. 
                  (6)  Public facilities impacts. Whether the proposal will result in a use which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, schools, parks, or other public facilities and services. 
                  (7)  Consistency with comprehensive plan. Whether the proposal is in conformity with the policy and intent of the locally adopted comprehensive plan. 
                  (8)  Other conditions. Whether there are any other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the proposal. 
                  (g)  In addition to the review criteria listed above, the following review criteria shall be utilized in the review of rezoning applications for two-family developments (duplexes), townhouse developments, and multi-family developments (apartments) in excess of 12 units: 
                  (1)  Rezoning for two-family, townhouse, and multi-family uses should not be permitted on parcels that are surrounded on more than two sides by property that is either used for single-family residential uses or zoned R-12, R-40, or R-20.

                  (5)  Rezoning for two-family, townhouse, and multi-family uses should be evaluated in the context of the comparatively greater impacts of multi-family housing on city services when considered as a land development pattern; and the city's policy to limit the amount of multi-family housing to the proportion that currently exists, approximately 50 percent of the total housing stock.

                  No application for rezoning property within the city to the same zoning classification previously requested shall be considered if the area requested to be rezoned to the zoning classification sought, has been considered and denied by the mayor and city council within a period of 12 months immediately preceding the application.

                  Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall be subject to the fines and penalties provided in chapter 1 of the Code; however, prosecution under the provisions of chapter 1 does not limit the city's right or ability to seek other remedies and take other legal or equitable actions that may be necessary to protect the public. Each day that said violation continues after the date of the service of the citation of violation shall constitute a separate prosecutable offense. 
                  Sec. 100-16. - Variance requests. 
                  When special conditions are present such that it is shown that a literal enforcement of the provisions of this land development code will result in an unnecessary hardship, a variance of the literal enforcement of the rules may be granted if the spirit of the regulation can be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon finding by the board of development appeals that relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of the regulation, and the presence of at least one of the additional conditions set out as follow: 
                  (1)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography; 
                  (2)  The application of the subdivision regulation to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; 
                  (3)  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; 
                  (4)  Such conditions are not a result of any action of the property owner;

                  Appeals to the board may be made by any person dissatisfied by a decision or interpretation made by the particular city official charged with the administration and enforcement of the land development code or any other ordinance or provision of the Code to which the right of appeal is given to the board of development appeals.

                  An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the city certifies to the board after the notice of appeal shall have been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in the city's opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the superior court of the county in which the property at issue is located.

                  (2)  Plans supporting the approval and procedure outlined in subsection (1) of this section shall be submitted in triplicate. Upon approval by the mayor and city council said plans shall bear a certificate by the city clerk indicating said approval with the stipulated conditions. One copy of said plan shall be maintained by the city clerk as a part of the record of rezoning, one copy filed with the zoning enforcement officer and one copy returned to the applicant. 
                  (3)  If for any reason, development and use of the property approved in accordance with the procedure outlined in subsections (1) and (2) of this section cannot be accomplished, such plans shall not be altered, changed or varied, except after approval by the mayor and city council. 
                  (4)  If no building permit or certificate of occupancy, based upon approved plan and amendment, is issued within 12 months from the date of approval of any such "conditional" rezoning, the mayor and city council may, on its own motion, cause the property to revert to its original zoning category after notice by U. S. Mail addressed to the original applicant for rezoning or to such other person as may be substituted for said original applicant and the filing of the same upon the records of the clerk, and reasonable opportunity to said applicant to oppose the reversion to the original zoning category has been given. 
                  (5)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary which might appear in this land development code, the mayor and council shall have all powers to approve and to enforce conditional zoning not otherwise prohibited by state and federal law.

The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (f)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.

After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall, forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the city clerk/city tax officer. 
                  (h)  It shall be the duty of the city tax officer to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. § 48-4-5; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply; provided, further, that redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. The city tax officer may initiate enforcement of liens imposed under this section at any time following receipt of the final determination of costs from the public officer. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  (i)  The city tax officer shall remit the amount collected to the city treasurer. Any such amount collected shall be deposited in the general fund of the city. 
                  (j)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.

A maximum of three brick courses will be allowed for adjustment of the manhole frame and cover to be flush with the proposed grade. 
                  (3)  Pipe connection to manhole. Connections of pipe to manhole for four-inch through 15-inch pipe shall be made with a flexible joint system. The joint system shall be a neoprene or synthetic rubber boot or sleeve, either cast or core drilled into the wall of manhole. The boot or sleeve shall be clamped and seated to the pipe with a stainless steel band. Manhole inverts shall be carefully constructed with cement grout, Class "B" concrete, or cement mortar brickwork; special care shall be taken to lay the channel and adjacent pipes to grade. Channels shall be properly formed, rounded, and troweled smooth. The connections of the sewer with the wall and channel of the manhole shall be tight and smooth. 
                  (4)  Drop manholes. Drop pipe shall not be smaller than eight inches. Generally, drop pipe shall be one size smaller than the sewer which they serve. Openings in walls of precast concrete manholes for drop connections shall not be made at joints. Drop connection fittings and riser pipe shall be encased in brick and mortar or formed Class "C" concrete. 
                  (c)  Service lines. At the time the main sewer is laid, the developer shall provide a six-inch PVC service line for all lots. The pipe shall be polyvinyl chloride, PVC, ASTM D-3034 DR-35. Service lines shall extend from the main sewer to the property line or edge of easement. 
                  (1)  Service branch connection for PVC pipe. Service branch connection for PVC pipe shall consist of molded or fabricated "T-Y" (in-line) branch fitting with all gasketed connections. Taps will be permitted only by special permission of the engineer and shall be a gasketed fitting in conjunction with a repair sleeve coupling or a gasketed saddle tee with all stainless steel clamps. Saddles may be mounted on pipe with solvent cement or gasket but shall be secured by metal banding. Saddles shall be installed in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. Holes for saddle connections shall be made by mechanical hole cutters or by keyhole saw or saber saw. Holes to tee saddles shall be laid out with a template and shall be deburred and carefully beveled where required to provide a smooth hole shaped to conform to the fitting. Fittings which are prefabricated using pipe sections, molded saddles and PVC solvent cement may be used, provided the solvent cement used in fabrication has cured at least 24 hours prior to installation. Cemented mitered connections without socket reinforcement shall not be used. PVC primer and solvent cement shall be used in accordance with the manufacturer's current recommendations and ASTM D 2855, as amended to date. After solvent cementing saddles, temporary band clamps must be quickly placed both upstream and downstream of the saddle and tightened. 
                  (2)  Service branches. 
                  a.  In general, service branches shall incline upward at approximately 45 degrees above a horizontal line normal to the direction of flow. Service lines shall be laid on a straight line and grade from the sewer or riser to the property line, and in no event shall service lines be less than 3½ feet deep to invert of the pipe at the property line. 
                  b.  Where required, short radius bends shall be used to connect the service branch to the house service line. Pipe service branches, together with bends, shall be placed on a compacted bed of crushed stone in such a manner as to be self-supporting and to relieve the strain on branches and bends. 
                  (3)  Risers. Where trench depths are such that risers are required for clay pipe, service lines shall be installed by excavating into ditch bank and installing riser in a vertical position against undisturbed earth, and the entire length of the pipe containing the riser encased in concrete in conformance with the details shown on the drawings. Risers shall extend to the heights directed by the design engineer and shall be encased in a brick masonry stack. No concrete encasement will be required for PVC riser. Bends shall be used to connect the riser to the house service lines. 
                  (4)  Stoppers, caps and plugs. All service connections shall be closed with factory manufactured pipe stopper of such design and secured in such a manner as to not leak under a maximum hydrostatic head of ten feet or five psi air pressure. The pipe stopper shall be able to be removed without special tools, excessive force or breakage of the pipe bell. 
                  (5)  Marking tape. Detectable marking tape shall be installed at the end of all service lines. The tape shall be two inches in width imprinted with the words "BURIED SEWER". The tape shall extend from the invert of the service line to the ground surface and shall be firmly secured at the invert, but shall not be tied to house services lines. 
                  (d)  Construction. 
                  (1)  Bedding of PVC, and ductile iron pipe. Bedding for PVC pipe shall be in accordance with ASTM D 2321. The pipe shall be bedded in compacted crushed stone bedding placed on a flat trench bottom. The compacted crushed stone bedding shall have a minimum thickness of six inches under the barrel and shall extend to the springline of the pipe. Bell holes shall be provided so as to relieve pipe bells of all load, but small enough to assure that support is provided throughout the length of the pipe barrel. Crushed stone bedding material shall conform to the latest revision of ASTM C 33, gradation #67 (ASTM #67), varying in sizes one-fourth-inch through three-fourths-inch. 
                  (2)  PVC pipe backfill. Backfill above the springline with Class I, II, or III material shall then be carried to a point six inches above the top of pipe, using hand tools for tamping. Silt, clays, including inorganic clays and silts of medium to high plasticity and liquid limits will not be allowed in a wet ditch. If the remaining backfill material contains large particles which could damage the pipe from impact during placement the initial backfill shall be increased to 12 inches above the top of the pipe. Puddling will not be allowed as a method of compaction. The remaining backfill shall be as specified in subsections (d)(5) and (6) of this section. Pipe shall have at least 30 inches of cover before wheel loading and at least 48 inches of cover before using heavy-duty tamping equipment such as a hydrohammer. 
                  (3)  Definition of bedding material. Class I, II, and III materials are defined as follows: 

                   
                  (4)  Ductile iron pipe. 
                  a.  The pipe shall be installed on a flat bottom trench on undisturbed earth with excavation for bells. Lightly consolidated backfill to centerline of pipe, additional backfill shall be as specified in subsections (d)(5) and (6) of this section. 
                  b.  Maximum depth of cover for ductile iron pipe for the various classes and sizes to be installed should be as recommended by the pipe manufacturer. 
                  c.  Ductile iron, mechanical or push-on joint, pipe may be used on piers in gravity sewer lines. Pipe shall be laid with One-fourth-inch clearance in each joint to provide for expansion. On mechanical joint pipe the bolts shall be tightened alternately 180 degrees apart but be left "finger-tight" until the sewage is diverted into the sewers; then bolts shall be further tightened a sufficient amount which will prevent leakage of the joint, but which will not prevent slippage which may occur because of temperature stresses. 
                  (5)  Selected backfilling. All trenches shall be backfilled immediately after pipes are laid therein, and joints have been inspected by the engineer, unless other protection of the pipeline is directed. Selected backfill material shall consist of finely divided earth, stone dust, sand, crushed stone, or other approved material carefully placed about the pipe and up to a height of at least 12 inches above the top of the pipe barrel, and in uniform layers not exceeding six inches in thickness, each layer thoroughly compacted with proper hand tools in a manner which will not disturb and/or injure the pipe. Backfilling shall be carried on simultaneously on both sides of the pipe and in a manner which will prevent injurious side pressures. If suitable select materials are not available from the trench excavation, the contractor will be required to obtain the select materials elsewhere. 
                  (6)  General backfilling. After selected backfill material has been placed and tamped, the remainder of the trench may be backfilled with general excavated material, except that no rock, unless in small shattered fragments, will be permitted to be mixed with other backfill material. 
                  (7)  Pipe stabilization. Wherever the subgrade is by nature too soft or mucky for the proper installation of the pipe, the contractor shall undercut the trench and backfill with crusher run stone or crushed stone three-fourths-inch in size and less. The stone shall be brought to the subgrade required by the class of bedding for the particular location and compacted. 
                  (8)  Jointing dissimilar pipe. Dissimilar pipes shall be joined together using flexible couplings. Concrete collars will be permitted only if flexible couplings are not available in sizes needed. Concrete collar shall be constructed of Class "A" concrete and shall be poured so as to completely and securely encase the entire joint. 
                  (9)  Connections to existing sewers. At locations where new sewers are shown to be connected to existing sewers at a new manhole, the contractor shall first expose the existing sewer, install a supporting timber beam, strap the pipe with suitable straps, and attach the straps to the beam; all in a manner which will bridge the excavation for the new manhole. The manhole shall then be constructed, and be complete with invert, frame, and cover. Under special conditions, and with approval by the engineer, the contractor may temporarily block and/or divert sewage flows to facilitate construction operations. Actual physical connection of the sewers will be made at a later date, as directed by the engineer. 
                  (10)  Replacement of concrete curb and gutter, street, driveway and sidewalk. Concrete curb and gutter, street, driveway and sidewalk shall be replaced with Class "A," 3,000 psi concrete of the same thickness and dimensions as was removed. 
                  (11)  Roadway and railroad crossing. The subdivider or his contractor shall install pipe lines across a roadway or railroad in accordance with the applicable regulations of the state department of transportation or governing railroad body. Recently paved city streets shall be bored and cased in steel casing at least 1½ times the proposed pipe outside diameter. Steel pipe casing shall be manufactured from steel conforming to ASTM A 252 Grade 2 with a minimum yield strength of 35,000 psi before cold forming. The casing ten inches in diameter and less shall be a minimum of 0.375-inch wall thickness. Casing greater than ten inches shall be a minimum of one-half-inch wall thickness. When crossing city streets, the casing shall extend at least five feet off of the edge of pavement on each side. Coating for the casing is not required. The pipe shall be supported by skids within the casing such that the pipe bell does not rest on the bottom of the casing. When the city street is in disrepair, the street may be open cut trench in accordance with state department of transportation standard 1401. 
                  (e)  Testing and cleaning. Before acceptance of any sewer or systems of sewers, lines shall be cleaned and tested. Where any obstruction is met, the contractor will be required to clean the sewers by means of rods, swabs, or other instruments. Lines and manholes shall be clean before final inspection. Pipe lines shall be straight and show a uniform grade between manholes. The contractor shall be required to correct any defective pipe which may be disclosed during the inspection. Each section of sewer between manholes shall show, upon examination from either end, a reasonably full circle of light. 
                  (f)  Deflection testing for PVC pipe. The maximum deflection in the installed PVC pipeline shall not exceed five percent of the pipe's original internal diameter. Deflection testing will be required using either a deflectometer or a "GO-NO-GO" mandrel. Where deflection is found to be in excess of five percent of the original pipe diameter, the contractor shall excavate to the point of excess deflection and carefully compact around the point where excess deflection was found. The line shall then be retested for deflection. However, should after the initial testing the deflection pipe fail to return to the original size (inside diameter), the line shall be replaced. 
                  (g)  Leakage tests. All sewer lines, including house service lines, shall be tested for leakage, in the presence of the engineer or his representative, before being placed into service. Tests shall be conducted by one or a combination of the following three methods: 
                  (1)  Infiltration test. Where natural groundwater levels stand a minimum of two feet above the top of the pipe, the amount of leakage may be determined from measurements made at the lower end of the sewer section under test. Sewers above the test section shall be closed before testing by the installation of suitable watertight bulkheads. The length of the test section shall be determined by the engineer. The average of six readings at five-minute intervals will be used to determine the rate of infiltration for any one test section. The rate of infiltration of groundwater into any test section of sewer, including manholes, shall not exceed the following: 

                   
                  (2)  Exfiltration test. Where natural groundwater levels do not stand two feet above the top of the pipe, an exfiltration test shall be conducted on each section of sewer. The test shall be performed up to an average maximum hydrostatic head of ten feet. The test shall be conducted in the following manner: 
                  a.  The ends of the pipe in the test section shall be closed with suitable watertight bulkheads. Inserted into each bulkhead at the top of the sewer pipe shall be a two-inch pipe nipple with an elbow. At the upper end of the test section a riser pipe shall be installed. The test section of pipe shall be filled through the pipe connection in the lower bulkhead which shall be fitted with a tight valve, until all air is exhausted and until water overflows the riser pipe at the upper end. Water may be introduced into the pipe 24 hours prior to the test period to allow complete saturation. House service lines, if installed, shall also be fitted with suitable bulkheads having provisions for the release of air while the test section is being filled with water. 
                  b.  During the test period, which shall extend over a period of 30 minutes, water shall be introduced into the riser pipe from measured containers at such intervals as are necessary to maintain the water level at the top of the riser pipe. The total volume of water added during the 30-minute test period shall not exceed that shown for infiltration in subsection (g)(1) of this section. 
                  (3)  Low-pressure air test. Where sewer grades are such that preclude performance of the exfiltration test or at the contractor's option, a low-pressure air test shall be conducted on each section of sewer after completion and before acceptance. 
                  a.  Prior to air testing, the section of sewer between manholes shall be thoroughly cleaned and wetted. Immediately after cleaning or while the pipe is water soaked, the sewer shall be tested with low-pressure air. At the contractor's option sewers may be tested in lengths between manholes or in short sections (25 feet or less) using air-lock balls pulled through the line from manhole to manhole. Air shall be slowly supplied to the plugged sewer section until internal air pressure reaches approximately 4.0 psi. After this pressure is reached and the pressure allowed to stabilize (approximately two to five minutes), the pressure may be reduced to 3.5 psi before starting the tests. If a 1.0 psi drop does not occur within the test time, then the line has passed the test. If the pressure drops more than 1.0 psi during the test time, the line is presumed to have failed the test, and the contractor will be required to locate the failure, make necessary repairs and retest the line. Minimum test time for various pipe sizes, in accordance with ASTM C 828, as amended to date, is as follows: 

                   
                  b.  Required test equipment includes air-lock balls, braces, air hose, air source, timer, rotometer as applicable, cut-off valves, pressure reducing valve, 0-15 pressure gauge, 0-5 pressure gauge with gradations in 0.1 psi and accuracy of two percent. 
                  c.  The contractor shall keep records of all tests made. A copy of such records will be given to the engineer or the owner. Such records shall show date, line number and stations, operator and such other pertinent information as required by the engineer. 
                  (4)  Repairs. All visible leaks shall be repaired regardless of whether infiltration, exfiltration or air test is within allowable limits. No sewer will be accepted until leakage tests demonstrate compliance with one of the above leakage test methods.

                  (a)  It is the purpose of this article to provide environmentally sound landscape amenities screening design standards which promote a positive community image by promoting quality development, enhancing property values, providing for landscape improvements in the city and promoting orderly growth and aesthetic quality in the city. It is also the intent to promote a healthy, natural environment whenever possible by protecting and enhancing existing vegetation. 
                  (b)  Landscaping enhances a community's environmental and visual character and improves the overall quality of life. Vegetation can also improve air and water quality, reduce soil erosion, reduce noise and glare, provide habitat for wildlife, moderate the climate and enhance property values, thus protecting the health, safety and welfare of the community. 
                  (c)  However, inappropriate landscaping can degrade the quality of the natural environment by requiring excess water and pesticides, or by creating unnecessary conflicts with sewers, sidewalks and vehicle access. Thus it is important to promote environmentally sound landscaping, including the use of low-maintenance, drought-resistant and native or non-invasive plants, and to ensure that the right tree is planted in the right place. Environmentally sound landscaping also means prohibiting the use of invasive and potentially invasive species. Although well-mannered, non-native species can be welcomed additions to a landscape, invasive species can cause severe economic and environmental harm (including crop damage and degradation of native habitats) and can engender significant control costs. 
                  (d)  This article also establishes standards for screening in required buffers. Buffers between two incompatible uses minimize harmful impacts such as transmission of noise, dust and glare. Buffers can also lessen visual pollution, establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion, and thus protect the public health, safety and welfare of the community. The presence of trees and other vegetation aids in stormwater management, helps to prevent erosion, improves air quality, conserves energy, provides wildlife habitat and preserves and enhances property values. 
                  (e)  Additionally, this article is intended to require the landscaping of new parking lots in order to reduce the harmful effects of wind and air turbulence, heat and noise, and the glare of motor vehicle lights; to prevent soil erosion; to provide shade; and to enhance the appearance of parking lots.

                  Sec. 104-101. - Buffers required. 
                  Buffers for individual uses shall be provided according to the requirements shown on the table providing set distances in chapter 110, the land use chapter.

                  Sec. 104-102. - Screening specifications in required buffers. 
                  (a)  Screening shall be established along side and rear lot lines within all buffers that are required by the land development code. The arborist may require additional screening in the area outside required landscape strips and buffers, for purposes of obscuring features such as rear entrances, utility and maintenance structures, and loading facilities. Landscaping shall be used whenever possible to screen objectionable views, noises, or nuisances, such as service areas, refuse containers, air conditioning units, transformers, etc. 
                  (b)  All required screening shall consist of shrubs and/or trees but may be permitted or required to be supplemented with walls, fences or earth berms. Screening shall be of such nature and density to screen activities on the lot from view from the normal level of a first story window on an abutting lot and shall provide year-round maximum opacity from the ground to a height of at least six feet. Trees and shrubs shall be installed to not only provide maximum opacity, but to allow for proper plant growth and maintenance. 
                  (c)  To achieve maximum opacity within buffers, the following alternatives, or combination thereof, shall be considered by the applicant and applied, subject to the approval of the arborist: 
                  (1)  Six-foot-high evergreen screening shrubs planted four feet on center. 
                  (2)  Tall evergreen trees stagger-planted with branches touching ground. 
                  (3)  Combination of small shrubs planted 30 inches on center, small trees planted 30 feet on center, and large trees planted 40 feet on center. 
                  (4)  Six-foot-high masonry wall. 
                  (d)  In selecting materials and the size of plantings to be installed, the applicant and the arborist shall consider the purpose of the landscape and the following required materials:

                  Sec. 104-103. - Landscape plan. 
                  A landscaping plan approved by the arborist shall be required prior to the issuance of a land use permit or building permit to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this Code. The landscape plan shall be based on an accurate boundary survey of the site or reasonable property description and shall include the following: 
                  (1)  Location and general type of existing vegetation; 
                  (2)  Existing vegetation to be saved; 
                  (3)  Methods and details for protecting existing vegetation during construction; 
                  (4)  Locations and labels for all proposed plants and a plant list or schedule showing the proposed and minimum required quantities; 
                  (5)  Location and description of other landscape improvements, such as earth berms, walls, fences, screens, sculptures, fountains, street furniture, lights, and courts or paved areas.

                  Sec. 104-104. - Approval of landscaping and other materials. 
                  Approval of all landscaping and other materials by the arborist shall be required. The arborist shall have broad discretion in approving the specific types of landscaping and other materials provided in the landscape requirements of this Code. However, the following general guidance is provided and specific lists of approved species are provided in this Code: 
                  (1)  The use of native plants as landscaping materials is encouraged wherever possible. 
                  (2)  Invasive or potentially invasive plants are not permitted. However, well-mannered, non-native plants are acceptable if they are not considered invasive or potentially invasive. 
                  (3)  Existing tree cover and natural vegetation shall be preserved, whenever possible, or replaced with suitable vegetation. 
                  (4)  Ground cover should be used to supplement landscaping in appropriate areas to reduce the need for extensive grass lawns, which would require regular watering in drought conditions. 
                  (5)  Grass areas shall be sodded. However, if grass seed must be used, it shall be a variety suitable to the area that produces complete coverage. 
                  (6)  No artificial plants, trees, or other vegetation shall be installed. 
                  (Ord. of 10-20-2008, § 12) 
                  Sec. 104-105. - Tree planting guidelines. 
                  (a)  Only healthy trees with a well-developed root system and a well formed top, characteristic of the species, should be planted. 
                  (b)  Trees selected for planting must be compatible with the specific site conditions. 
                  (c)  The ability of a species to regenerate a new root system and to become re-established should be considered. Generally, deciduous trees should be planted in the fall after leaf drop, or in early spring before bud break. There are indications that bare root trees will re-establish more readily if planted in early spring just prior to bud break. 
                  (d)  Trees should not be planted deeper than they were in their former location or container. 
                  (e)  Once the transplanted tree is set, the hole should be backfilled with soil of good texture and structure. Backfill material should be comprised of a mix of native soil, organic matter such as peat, and inorganic material such as pearlite or vermiculite in a 1:1:1 ratio, although a backfill with native soil alone may be adequate. 
                  (f)  The addition of fertilizer to backfill soil can cause root injury and is therefore not recommended. If fertilizer must be added, a small amount should be used. Approximately 1.5 pounds of nitrogen per cubic yard of backfill is recommended for bare root plants, and 2.5 pounds of nitrogen per cubic yard of backfill for balled and burlaped trees. 
                  (g)  The backfill should be gently tamped (but not compacted) and soaked for settling. The soil should be slightly mounded to allow for settling; a ridge or dike around the perimeter of the hole can facilitate watering. 
                  (h)  Pruning. The amount of pruning necessary for newly planted trees depends upon the trees' response to planting. A decrease in leaf surface area from pruning can result in a reduction of the production of food, thus ultimately inhibiting root development. Pruning for vigor or to train young trees should therefore be delayed until after the first growing season. 
                  (i)  Staking should be used on newly planted trees only where determined necessary. The extent of staking will depend upon tree strength, form and condition at planting, expected wind conditions, the amount of vehicle or foot traffic and the level of follow-up maintenance. Staking can cause tree damage. Periodic follow-up inspections are required to prevent serious treestaking problems. Staking should be removed as soon as the tree is capable of providing its own anchorage and support. 
                  (j)  Mulching newly planted trees will reduce competition from weeds and moderate soil moisture and temperature extremes. 
                  (k)  Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease or nutritional disorders. 
                  (l)  Trees selected for planting must be free of root defects.

                  Sec. 104-106. - Landscape maintenance and landscape bond. 
                  (a)  The owner, occupant, tenant and respective agent of each, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance and protection of all landscaping required to be installed pursuant to this Code. 
                  (b)  Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the developer or owner shall post a maintenance bond or cash escrow guaranteeing all landscaping materials and work for a period of two years after approval or acceptance thereof by the city in a sum established by the arborist. The bond will be in the amount of 50 percent of the estimated cost of replacing all of the landscaping required by these specifications, unless otherwise specified by the arborist. The city arborist shall determine the value of the landscaping by using the means standard costs book or from a registered landscape architect. At the end of two years, the arborist shall make an inspection and notify the owner or developer and the bond company of any corrections to be made. If no maintenance is required, or if maintenance is provided by said responsible party, the arborist shall release the bond. 
                  (c)  Due to adverse weather conditions as determined by the arborist, to include extreme drought, planting may be delayed and a certificate of occupancy will be issued if the owner posts performance bond or cash escrow. The performance bond will be in the amount of 100 percent of the proposed cost of the landscaping improvements from the approved landscape plan. The bond shall be for a period of two years and all landscaping improvements must be in place no later than the expiration of the bond. The landscaping improvements should be put in place at the termination of the adverse weather conditions if sooner than the expiration date of the bond. Once all of the landscaping improvements are in place and a maintenance bond or cash escrow is posted under the requirements of this section, the arborist shall release the performance bond.

                  ARTICLE II. - WETLAND PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 106-19. - Findings, title and purpose. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. 
                  (1)  The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. 
                  (2)  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  (3)  It is therefore necessary for the city to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands. 
                  (b)  Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the "Wetland Protection Ordinance" of the city. The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat. 
                  (Code 1996, § 42-101; Ord. No. 01-03-22B, § 1, 3-22-2001) 
                  Sec. 106-20. - Wetland protection district boundaries. 
                  The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (Code 1996, § 42-102; Ord. No. 01-03-22B, § 2, 3-22-2001) 
                  Sec. 106-21. - Local development permit requirements. 
                  (a)  Requirement for local permit or permission. No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or permit from the city. If the area proposed for development is within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the building inspector using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued. 
                  (b)  Permissible uses (uses as of right). The following uses shall be allowed as a right within a wetland to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein. 
                  (1)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
                  (2)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
                  (3)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (4)  The continued cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
                  (5)  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
                  (6)  Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
                  (7)  Temporary emergency permit. A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the city or its designee for the following reasons: 
                  a.  Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the pubic to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to the city or their designee and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
                  b.  Temporary water-level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations. 
                  c.  Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating, or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use. 
                  d.  Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland. 
                  (c)  Site plans. Applications for a local development permit within the generalized wetland protection district shall include a site plan, drawn at a scale of not less than one inch equals 50 feet, with the following information: 
                  (1)  A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved, cross-sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on the cross-sectional drawings. 
                  (2)  A map of any wetland boundaries occurring within the site must be provided. This boundary may be included on other maps provided by the applicant. 
                  (3)  Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site and adjacent to the site for a distance of 100 feet. 
                  (4)  The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body. 
                  (5)  Elevations of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than two feet; and no greater than one foot for slopes less than or equal to two percent. 
                  (6)  Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing accidentally released hazardous or toxic materials. 
                  (7)  All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology. 
                  (d)  Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform with the specifications of said site plan. The site plan may be amended only with the approval of the city or its designee. The city or its designee may require additional information deemed necessary to verify compliance with the provisions of this article or to evaluate the proposed use in terms of the purposes of this article. 
                  (e)  Subdivision design options in the wetland protection district. Any subdivision that includes jurisdictional wetlands shall be allowed and encouraged to use the following options: 
                  (1)  Lot size averaging. Lot size averaging is encouraged in single-family detached subdivisions as a means to work around wetland areas. The city or its designee may allow a reduction in lot size provided that the same number of lots in the same subdivision are oversized by an equal or greater area. The maximum permissible reduction shall not exceed 25 percent of the minimum required lot area. The number of lots with areas reduced shall not exceed 25 percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision. The city or its designee shall require no more than a 25 percent adjustment of rear, side and front setbacks for each affected lot. 
                  (2)  Cluster development. Clustering of residential development is encouraged. When considering subdivision approval, the city or its designee will allow incorporation of wetland or other significant natural areas as open space in the subdivision plan. Such plans should designate at least 25 percent of the gross land area as open space. Density shall be calculated by subtracting from the total acreage of a parcel all land dedicated or in use for private or public roads, including all vehicular rights-of-way. The resultant acreage will then be divided by the minimum allowed lot size of the district to derive the number of lots permissible. 
                  (f)  Filing fee. At the time of the application, the applicant shall pay a filing fee specified by the city or its designee. Filing fees up to a maximum of $100.00 may be required to evaluate the application. This fee may be used to retain expert consultants who will provide services pertaining to functional assessment, mitigation and wetland boundary determinations as deemed necessary by the city or its designee. 
                  (g)  Enforcement authority. The building inspector is hereby established as the administrator of this article. 
                  (h)  Review procedures. The application shall be made to the building inspector and will be reviewed within 30 days. The review period shall begin upon determination by the building inspector that the application submitted is complete. The review period shall include the preparation of findings (approval or disapproval) by the building inspector. The applicant will receive written notification of the findings of the city or its designee. If the review process is not completed within 30 days, the application is considered to be approved. 
                  (i)  Appeals. Decisions on permit applications made by the building inspector may be appealed to the mayor and city council. The appeal must be made within 30 days of the decision rendered by the building inspector. A public hearing shall be held for appeals. Public announcement of the hearing shall be printed in a local newspaper of general circulation at least 15 days prior to the hearing. Any person may offer testimony at the hearing. The decision of the mayor and city council may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction, as discussed section 106-23. 
                  (j)  Duration of permit validity. 
                  (1)  If construction described in the development permit has not commenced within 12 months from the date of issuance, the permit shall expire. 
                  (2)  If construction described in the development permit is suspended or abandoned after work has commenced, the permit shall expire 12 months after the date that work ceased. 
                  (3)  Written notice of the pending expiration of the development permit shall be issued by the building inspector. 
                  (Code 1996, § 42-103; Ord. No. 01-03-22B, § 3, 3-22-2001)

                  (a)  The city or its designee, its agent, officers and employees shall have authority to enter upon privately-owned land for the purpose of performing their duties under this article and may take or cause to be made such examinations, surveys or sampling as the city or its designee deems necessary. 
                  (1)  All enforcement and monitoring activities conducted by the city or its designee that involves entrance to privately owned land by the city or its designee shall be preceded by written notification to the landowner. Said notification shall be issued at least seven days prior to the activities specified in the notification. 
                  (2)  The building inspector shall have authority to enforce this article; issue permits hereunder; and address violations or threatened violations hereof by issuance of violation notices, administrative orders and civil and criminal actions. All costs, fees and expenses in connection with such actions may be recovered as damages against the violator. 
                  (3)  Law enforcement officials or other officials having police powers shall have authority to assist the building inspector in enforcement. 
                  (4)  The building inspector shall have authority to issue cease and desist orders in the event of any violation of this article. Cease and desist orders may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction, as identified in section 106-23. 
                  (b)  The city or its designee may require a bond in an amount of $1,000.00 and with surety and conditions sufficient to secure compliance with the conditions set forth in the permit. The particular amount and the conditions of the bond shall be consistent with the purposes of this article. In the event of a breach of any condition of any such bond, the city or its designee may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction upon such bond and prosecute the same to judgment and execution. 
                  (Code 1996, § 42-104; Ord. No. 01-03-22B, § 4, 3-22-2001) 
                  Sec. 106-23. - Penalties. 
                  (a)  When a building or other structure has been constructed in violation of this article, the violator may be required to remove the structure at the discretion of the city or its designee. 
                  (b)  When removal of vegetative cover, excavation or fill has taken place in violation of this article, the violator may be required to restore the affected land to its original contours and to restore vegetation, as far as practicable, at the discretion of the city or its designee. 
                  (c)  If the city or its designee discovers a violation of this article that also constitutes a violation of any provision of the Clean Water Act as amended, the city or its designee shall issue written notification of the violation to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the landowner. 
                  (d)  Suspension, revocation. The city or its designee may suspend or revoke a permit if it finds that the applicant has not complied with the conditions or limitations set forth in the permit or has exceeded the scope of the work set forth in the permit. The city or its designee shall cause notice of denial, issuance, conditional issuance, revocation or suspension of a permit to be published in a daily newspaper having a broad circulation in the area where the wetland is located. 
                  (Code 1996, § 42-105; Ord. No. 01-03-22B, § 5, 3-22-2001) 
                  Sec. 106-24. - Judicial review. 
                  (a)  Jurisdiction. All final decisions of the city or its designee concerning denial, approval or conditional approval of a special permit shall be reviewable in the superior court in which the property is located. 
                  (b)  Alternative actions. Based on these proceedings and the decision of the court, the city or its designee may, within the time specified by the court, elect to: 
                  (1)  Institute negotiated purchase or condemnation proceedings to acquire an easement or fee interest in the applicant's land; 
                  (2)  Approve the permit application with lesser restrictions or conditions (i.e., grant a variance); or 
                  (3)  Institute other appropriate actions ordered by the court that fall within the jurisdiction of the building inspector.

                  APPENDIX—SOURCE MATERIAL FOR THE PREPARATION OF GENERALIZED WETLAND MAPS 
                  (1)  National Wetlands Inventory Maps (NWI). NWI maps are the most commonly used maps. Most of these maps are at scales of 1:24,000 and correspond to United States Geologic Survey (USGS) topographic maps. The minimum area mapped is usually one to three acres. Small wetlands and very narrow wetlands in river corridors may be missed. 
                  These maps were developed from interpretations of available aerial photographs; therefore, mapped boundaries of wetlands do not reflect jurisdictional boundaries (as would be determined if the federal delineation manual were used on the ground). 
                  Only a small portion of the maps has been "ground-truthed," but nationwide efforts to assess the accuracy of the maps have been extensive. Accuracy varies upward from about 60 percent, with most maps being at least 90 percent accurate. 
                  The strength of these maps is the spatial resolution (often to within one acre, which is relatively good). NWI maps identify the location of wetlands and indicate wetland type using the Cowardin classification scheme. 
                  The limitations of these maps are that wetlands that were cultivated at the time of mapping are generally not depicted and forested wetlands are poorly discriminated. In some areas, these two wetland types are a major portion of the wetlands resource. Particularly in areas of rapid growth and accelerated wetlands loss, many maps have become quickly outdated. 
                  Maps are available through: 
                  1.  National Wetlands Inventory, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Regional Office, 1875 Century Boulevard, Atlanta, Georgia 30345. Telephone: 1-404-266-8500. 
                  2.  Earth Science Information Center, U.S. Geological Survey, Reston, Virginia. Telephone: 1-800-USA-MAPS. 
                  Other information, including information about wetland functions and values and options for their protection, can be obtained from the EPA Wetland Protection Hotline, LABAT-ANDERSON, Inc., 2200 Clarendon Boulevard, Suite 900, Arlington, Virginia 22201. Telephone: 1-800-832-7828. 
                  (2)  County Soil Survey Maps. These maps range in scale from 1:15,840 to 1:31,680. Soil maps do not delineate wetlands, but rather their presence may be inferred from the occurrence of soils classified as "hydric" by the Soil Conservation Service. From accompanying soil interpretation record data, wetlands might cautiously be classified by type. These maps were developed by trained soil scientists who examined vertical soil profiles at regular intervals along ground transects and generalized subjectively from them to the surrounding landscape on the basis of landform, vegetation and other factors. 
                  These maps do not specify wetland type as do the NWI maps. Most published soil surveys report the acreage of each soil series in the survey area. Soil survey maps are extensively used as a secondary data source for wetlands mapping. However, hydric soil inclusions (patches of hydric soil too small to map) are probably common in many soils mapped as non-hydric, but the extent to which this occurs is unknown. It should also be noted that some soils classified as hydric are not hydric everywhere they are mapped; marginally hydric soils indicate wetlands only in certain landscape positions. Caution should therefore be used when inferring the presence of wetlands from soils classified and mapped as hydric. 
                  The advantage of using these maps is that they are sometimes available in areas where NWI maps are not yet available. Soil surveys might be used, with caution, to infer locations of cropped wetlands not included in NWI maps; to differentiate among some wetland functional types (alluvial seasonally flooded vs. isolated seasonally flooded) when linked with the SCS SOILS database which describes the physical properties of each soil series; and to categorize hydrologic and water purification function of specific wetlands. 
                  Limitations of these maps are numerous. Many small but cumulatively significant areas that often are wetlands (with hydric soil inclusions) are not mapped because the soil classification systems used in soil survey maps classify soils in landscape groupings. Aquatic bed and many tidal or permanently flooded wetlands are typically mapped as open water, not wetlands, on SCS maps. Areas classified as having hydric soils are not always wetlands, in part because they may have been drained (either prior to or after the survey was conducted). This can lead to overestimation of current wetlands acreage. Many drained hydric soils can retain sufficient "hydric" features to result in their being classified by soil mappers as hydric even after decades of continuous drainage. Conversely, not all wetlands contain soils that are classified as hydric, and this can lead to underestimation of wetlands acreage. Wetlands may be the result of recent impoundment; in such areas, it typically takes at least a decade for hydric soil features to appear. Moreover, even the soils of some wetlands with hydric characteristics that have existed for decades do not appear on the SCS hydric soils list. 
                  Maps are available through: U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service field offices (generally located in the county seat of each county). 
                  (3)  State Soil Geographic Data Base (STATSGO) and National Soil Geographic Data Base (NATSGO) maps. 
                  STATSGO maps are available at 1:250,000 scale with about 100 acres resolution. Digital coverage maps will be available by late 1993. These maps include soils on federal land. 
                  NATSGO maps are available at 1:3,000,000 and are currently available showing the entire United States. They do not include federal land. 
                  STATSGO maps are generally based on soil surveys completed since 1960. SCS has determined the map unit composition (the groupings of soil types mapped as a single polygon or unit) by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed SCS county soil survey maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize each whole map unit. 
                  Wetlands themselves are not delineated; rather their presence may be inferred from the presence of soils officially considered "hydric." From accompanying SOILS data, which describe the physical properties of each soil series, these wetlands landscapes might cautiously be classified by function. 
                  NATSGO maps are also generally based on soil surveys completed since 1960. Map units are the polygons of SCS's Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) map. The sample points of the National Resources Inventory (NRI) are statistically aggregated within each MLRA unit. Each NRI record is keyed to the soil interpretation record (SOILS) data base so that soil attributes relevant to wetlands function are available for each of the 300,000 NRI sample points. 
                  These maps are relatively new and have not been tested extensively against wetlands field data. 
                  Both map types are the only currently available maps from which the landscape-level water purification and flood control functions of wetlands might be inferred for all areas of the United States. 
                  The scale/resolution of the maps is inappropriate for most planning purposes at the local level. Also, these maps cannot be used to infer the functions of an individual wetland. Inferences of wetlands functions at the landscape level would be based on hydric soils, but not all hydric soils are wetlands. In the case of the STATSGO data, the soil mapping units do not necessarily coincide with physical boundaries that are relevant to defining landscape functional units (watersheds). This could lead to some imprecision in estimates compiled on that basis. The generation and compilation of thematic maps from STATSGO and NATSGO maps requires a mainframe computer with adequate storage, advanced data base management and GIS software and a skilled computer technician.

                  (4)  Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Swampbuster Maps. These maps are mostly at a scale of 1:12,000 or 1:20,000 and primarily cover cropland and areas closely associated with cropland. 
                  Most maps were completed since 1987 and largely represent a one-time assessment; about five percent may be reassessed annually. 
                  Wetland boundaries were hand drawn on recent aerial photographs. The delineations were based on an overlay of hydric soils maps; hydrophytic vegetation and presence of surface water (as visible from aerial photographs from multiple years); and, in some cases, field checking to confirm wetlands status. 
                  These maps probably represent the most extensive, detailed and up-to-date map source for wetlands in certain areas. However, because these maps are relatively new, they are not widely used because of limited distribution. 
                  These maps are not for sale but can be viewed at state SCS offices. 
                  The strength of these maps is that they are a useful complement to NWI maps because they include many of the wetlands that NWI misses, specifically, cropped and very small wetlands. 
                  The limitation of these maps is that because wetland boundaries were drawn on aerial photographs not printed for mass distribution, the maps are difficult to access and compile and they often do not include prior converted wetlands. 
                  (5)  FEMA Flood Hazard Maps. The scale varies depending on the locality and ranges from one inch equals 2,000 feet to one inch equals 200 feet. 
                  Maps show floodplains of 100- and 500-year storm events based on analyses conducted since 1968. Floodplains were delineated from topographic maps, stream flow data, channel cross-sectional measurements and aerial photographs supplemented with limited hydraulic modeling and ground-checking. 
                  These maps are not extensively used to identify wetlands. 
                  The strength of these maps is that they might be used to help identify dominant water sources and transport vectors for specific wetlands located near rivers. They also might be used to identify wetlands that, if they store floodwater, are likely to have greater value because they help protect downstream properties that otherwise are likely to be flooded. 
                  Limitations are that FEMA maps are not available for all jurisdictions. The 100- and 500-year floodplains do not have any particular ecological or geomorphic significance (annual, two-year and five-year floodplains are probably more functionally important) and their correlation with wetlands or hydric soil extent or function is unknown. Their accuracy may be reduced in areas with very wide, flat floodplains and backwater flooding. Boundaries may be outdated on maps of communities that have experienced rapid development since mapping.

                  (6)  USGS Land-Use Land Analysis Maps (LUDA). Most LUDA maps are at a scale of 1:250,000; some are at 1:100,000. The minimum map unit size for the former is generally 40 acres (ten acres for open water). 
                  These maps are based on interpretation of aerial photographs at a scale of 1:62,500 and recognize only two types of wetlands: forested and non-forested wetlands. Additionally, each map represents only one time period, ranging from the late 1960s to the present. 
                  The maps are seldom used in identifying wetlands. 
                  The strengths of these maps are that they are the only source of digital wetlands data for nearly the entire United States and the only map data source that includes all landscape components, not just wetlands. This allows for better integration of wetlands data with other landscape data when interpreting the role of wetlands in the landscape. 
                  The limitation of these maps is that wetlands are grossly underestimated, because the minimum map unit size is too coarse and also because a consistent, modern definition of wetlands was not used during the mapping. In particular, forested, cropped and aquatic bed wetlands appear to be ignored or severely underestimated.

Although a useful complement to NWI maps, they were produced at an accuracy of 85 percent and have not been thoroughly field checked.

                  ARTICLE III. - WATER SUPPLY WATERSHEDS 

                  Sec. 106-58. - Purpose. 
                  (a)  In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering waters resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
                  (b)  The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the city.

                  Buffer means a natural or enhanced vegetated area with no or limited minor land disturbances, such as trails and picnic areas, located adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed. 
                  Corridor means all land within the buffer areas established adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed and within other setback areas specified in section 106-61. 
                  Impervious surface means a manmade structure or surface that prevents the infiltration of stormwater into the ground below the structure or surface. Examples are buildings, roads, driveways, parking lots, decks, swimming pools, or patios. 
                  Large water supply watershed means a watershed containing 100 square miles or more of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake. 
                  Perennial stream means a stream that flows throughout the whole year as indicated on a USGS quad map. 
                  Reservoir boundary means the edge of a water supply reservoir defined by its normal pool level. 
                  Small water supply watershed means a watershed that contains less than 100 square miles of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake. 
                  Utility means public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems and railroads or other utilities identified by a local government. 
                  Water supply reservoir means a governmentally owned impoundment of water for the primary purpose of providing water to one or more governmentally owned public drinking water systems. This excludes the multipurpose reservoirs owned by the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers.

                  ARTICLE IV. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREAS PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 106-85. - Purpose. 
                  (a)  In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that city and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. 
                  (b)  Groundwater resources are contained within underground reservoirs known as aquifers. These aquifers are zones of rock beneath the earth's surface capable of containing or producing water from a well. They occupy vast regions of the subsurface and are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
                  (Code 1996, § 42-151; Ord. No. 01-03-22A, § I, 3-22-2001) 
                  Sec. 106-86. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
                  Drastic means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600-2-87-035. (Note: The DRASTIC methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility.) 
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. 
                  Pollution susceptibility map means the relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the Department of Natural Resources, using the DRASTIC methodology (Georgia Department of Natural Resources Hydrologic Atlas 20: Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia). 
                  Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
                  Significant recharge areas means those areas mapped by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition).

                  Sec. 108-1. - Authorization. 
                  Pursuant to the city's general home-rule powers, the City of Bremen, Georgia, does ordain as follows. 
                  (Ord. No. 2008-05-19, art. 1, § A, 5-19-2008) 
                  Sec. 108-2. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 2008-05-19, art. 1, § B, 5-19-2008) 
                  Sec. 108-3. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  ARTICLE IV. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 108-77. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area, and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 108-78. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. 
                  a.  Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 108-77(4), "elevated buildings." 
                  b.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 108-59(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
                  1.  Individual lots or parcels; 
                  2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood; 
                  must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. section 108-77(6).) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)a3 of this section. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 108-28, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. 
                  Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article IV.

                  Sec. 108-79. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A Zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 108-28, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 108-28, then the city manager or his designee shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A Zone areas where a Limited Detail Study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 108-77(4), "elevated buildings." 
                  (4)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  (5)  The city manager or his designee shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  Sec. 108-80. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO Zones). 
                  Areas of special flood hazard established in section 108-28, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 108-77(4), "elevated buildings." The city manager or his designee shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water-tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in section 108-58(1)c and (2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  Sec. 108-108. - Requests; decisions; conditions for variance. 
                  (a)  The board of appeals as established by the city land development code shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the city manager or his designee in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of appeals may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Haralson or Carroll County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this chapter are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The city manager or his designee shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet, and/or where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. 
                  Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. In the absence of official designation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, areas of special flood hazard shall be those designated by the local community and referenced in section 108-28. 
                  Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
                  Basement means that portion of a building having its floor sub grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
                  Building means any structure built for support, shelter, or enclosure for any occupancy or storage. 
                  Critical facility means any public or private facility, which, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the disaster or would increase the hazard to life and health. The term "critical facility" includes: 
                  (1)  Structures or facilities that produce, use, or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic, or water-reactive materials; 
                  (2)  Hospitals and nursing homes, and housing for the elderly, which are likely to contain occupants who may not be sufficiently mobile to avoid the loss of life or injury during flood and storm events; 
                  (3)  Emergency operation centers or data storage centers which contain records or services that may become lost or inoperative during flood and storm events; and 
                  (4)  Generating plants, and other principal points of utility lines. 
                  Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, and permanent storage of materials or equipment. 
                  Elevated building means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a base flood event. 
                  Existing construction means any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced before November 9, 1981. 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before November 9, 1981. 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or 
                  (2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
                  Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Insurance Administration, where the boundaries of areas of special flood hazard have been defined as Zone A. 
                  Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, issued by the federal insurance administration, delineating the areas of special flood hazard and/or risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
                  Flood insurance study the official report by the federal insurance administration evaluating flood hazards and containing flood profiles and water surface elevations of the base flood. 
                  Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
                  Floodproofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. The term "freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is: 
                  (1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

                  b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this land development code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this chapter, the term "mean sea level" is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means any structure (see definition) for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after November 9, 1981 and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after November 9, 1981. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) as corrected in 1988 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis; 
                  (2)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any chapter requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement. 
                  (1)  The term "substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be: 
                  a.  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
                  b.  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
                  This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  (2)  For the purposes of this definition, the term "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  (3)  The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include: 
                  a.  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  b.  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

               <p>                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 110-1. - Purpose. 
                  Pursuant to the authority conferred by Ga. Const., art. IX, sec. 2, ¶ 4 and O.C.G.A. title 36, ch. 66, and for the purposes of promoting the health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity, or general welfare of the city; the various use districts which are created by this chapter and the various sections of this chapter are adopted for the following purposes, among others: 
                  (1)  To achieve such timing, density and distribution of land development and use as will prevent overcrowding of land so as to avoid undue concentration of population; 
                  (2)  To encourage such distribution and population to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public services; 
                  (3)  To encourage such distribution and population, land development and use as will secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; 
                  (4)  To regulate the location of trades, professions, businesses and industries; 
                  (5)  To achieve such density, design and distribution of housing as will protect and enhance residential property values; 
                  (6)  To preserve the city's historical and natural beauty, and encourage architecturally pleasing development; and to improve the quality of life through protection of the city's total environment including, but not limited to, the prevention of air, water and noise pollution; 
                  (7)  To protect the value of existing properties; and 
                  (8)  To promote the most appropriate use of land, buildings, and structures throughout the city; all in accordance with a comprehensive plan. 
                  Sec. 110-2. - Zoning district designations. 
                  For the purposes of this land development code, the city is divided into zoning districts as follows: 

                   
                  (Ord. of 8-18-2014, § 99.4.010) 
                  Sec. 110-3. - Location and boundaries of zoning districts. 
                  The location and boundaries of the zoning districts are hereby established as shown on the map entitled, "Zoning and Boundary Map of the City of Bremen, Georgia" and certified by the city clerk, which is by reference incorporated herein and made a part of this chapter, as amended from time to time. Said map shall be kept on file at the city hall where it shall be available for public inspection. Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official zoning and boundary map which may from time to time be published, the Official Zoning and Boundary Map of the City of Bremen, Georgia, located in city hall (hereinafter referred to as the "zoning map") shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of properties located within the corporate limits of the city. 
                  (Ord. of 8-18-2014, § 99.4.020) 
                  Sec. 110-4. - Interpretations of zoning district boundaries. 
                  Where uncertainty exists with respect to the location of the boundaries of any zoning district shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
                  (1)  Where a zoning district boundary is shown on the zoning map as approximately following a corporate limits lines, stream bed, lot line or the centerline of a street, highway, railroad right-of-way or such lines extended, then such lines shall be construed to be the district boundary line. 
                  (2)  Where a zoning district boundary line is shown on the zoning map as being set back from a street, highway, or railroad right-of-way, and approximately parallel thereto, then such district boundary line, unless otherwise specifically indicated, shall be construed as being at the scaled distance from the centerline of such street, highway or railroad right-of-way and as being parallel thereto. 
                  (3)  Where a zoning district line divides a lot, the requirements for the district in which the greater portion of the lot lies shall apply to the balance of the lot, except that such extension shall not include any part of a lot that lies more than 50 feet beyond the district boundary line. In the case of a through lot, fronting on two approximately parallel streets, that is divided by a district boundary line paralleling the streets, the restrictions of the district in which each frontage of the through lot lies shall apply to that respective portion of the through lot, as if the lot were two separate lots. 
                  (4)  The zoning district lines for the flood hazard district shall generally follow the contours of the land along the flood plain. Minimum flood level elevations are recorded at periodic intervals along the flood hazard district lines. At intermediate points, interpolation between the recorded even-foot elevations will be used to establish the minimum flood level. All elevations are based upon the U.S. Geological Survey datum. 
                  (5)  Where district boundaries are in doubt, the planning commission shall review the zoning records and the zoning map and make the determination as to the zoning designation for the property in question. Said interpretation and determination shall be final. 
                  (6)  Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated or abandoned by official action of the city council, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street, alley or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of same and all area included therein shall then and henceforth be subject to all appropriate regulations of the extended district. 
                  (Ord. of 8-18-2014, § 99.4.030) 
                  Sec. 110-5. - Uses; uses not listed. 
                  Uses permitted in each district are specifically listed. Higher uses, or uses allowed in a more restrictive district are not automatically allowed in a lower use district, unless so stated. For any use not listed in this chapter, the city manager shall determine the proper requirements by classifying the proposed use among the uses which are listed and assigning the use to appropriate zoning district, which may be reviewed by the planning and zoning commission pursuant to the standards for review and as set forth in this chapter. 
                  (Ord. of 8-18-2014, § 99.4.040) 
                  Sec. 110-6. - Classification of streets. 
                  For the purpose of this chapter, all of the streets, roads and highways in the city are classified as major streets, collector streets, or minor streets as follows: 
                  (1)  Major streets. Thoroughfares designed and used for high traffic volumes and cross-town traffic movement and generally intersected by collector streets. Major streets include the following: 
                  a.  Highway 27; 
                  b.  Highway 27 Business; 
                  c.  Highway 78. 
                  (2)  Collector streets. Minor thoroughfares designed for moderate traffic volumes, generally having right-of-way over intersecting local streets. Collector streets include the following: 
                  a.  Buchanan Street; 
                  b.  Georgia Avenue South; 
                  c.  McPherson Street; 
                  d.  Waddell Street. 
                  (3)  Local streets. A street designed and used primarily for low traffic volumes and access to individual abutting lots, and which have a terminal point or intersect a collector or a major street. All thoroughfares not classified as either major streets or collector streets are classified as local streets. 
                  (Ord. of 8-18-2014, § 99.4.050)

                  (a)  The FH Flood Hazard District includes land that is subject to periodic flooding. A floodplain district is established which shall correspond to all lands within the city that are mapped as floodplain or flood-prone lands as indicated on maps that have been prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and/or the soil survey of Haralson County and/or Carroll County prepared by the USDA Soil Conservation Service. This district shall be an overlay district. 
                  (b)  The intent of the regulations within this section is to limit the use of land contained within a floodplain. Notwithstanding the uses permitted for any applicable zoning district which apply to the property, no building or structure or land shall hereafter be used or occupied other than in this section provided, and no building or structure or part thereof shall be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or altered except in conformity with the requirements of this regulation when such lands fall within or are affected by a floodplain. No structures or obstruction to stormwater flow shall be erected or installed below the maximum flood elevation of the 100-year recurrence interval storm unless a plan is approved to compensate for the loss of flow area and flood storage. Land adjacent to flood hazard districts may be subject to periodic flooding even though it lies above the established minimum flood elevation. It shall remain the responsibility of the developer to adequately investigate the possibility of local flooding above the established minimum levels and to guard against damages which might be associated with such flooding. The planning commission may, when it deems it advisable, require proof to its satisfaction that no structures or obstructions will be erected or installed below the established minimum flood elevations. 
                  (1)  Uses permitted in the floodplain. To the extent that the listed uses do not conflict with state and federal requirements or portions of the city's flood prevention regulations set out in the land development code, within a floodplain, the following uses may be permitted subject to the requirements of the development regulations: 
                  a.  Agriculture, including forestry and livestock raising, requiring no structure within the floodway except structures for temporary shelter and including agriculture and forestry access roads. 
                  b.  Dams, provided they are designed and constructed in accordance with specifications of the State Safe Dam Act, latest revision, and the development regulations. 
                  c.  Public parks and recreation areas and facilities requiring no structures within the floodplain, except structures for temporary shelter, including, but not limited to, boat ramps, docks, parking areas and recreation facilities; private and commercial recreation developments and campgrounds. 
                  d.  Bridges, culverts and the roadway fill related to these structures, so long as said structure as constructed does not divert flow of waters onto adjacent properties unless proper permits and/or flowage easements have been obtained. 
                  e.  Parking areas. All required parking areas shall be located at an elevation higher than the calculated five-year storm, and shall not be located within any floodway. 
                  f.  Outdoor storage. 
                  g.  Fences having sufficient open area to permit the free flow of water and debris.

                  a.  In all residential zoning districts, up to 50 percent of the area located at or below the base flood elevation may be used in computations for meeting the density requirements in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
                  b.  No subdivision lot shall be approved which has less than 50 percent of the minimum lot area required by the applicable zoning district located above the base flood elevation. 
                  c.  Each plat or site plan submitted for rezoning, special use permit, or variance application shall contain a readily identifiable line indicating the limits of the base flood elevation if any portion of the property lies within the floodplain. This line shall be clearly labeled and the base flood elevation above mean sea level stated. The plat or site plan shall indicate where the base flood elevation has been established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or where the base flood elevation has been calculated by a registered professional engineer using the best available information.

                  When a lot of record existing at the time of the adoption of a particular provision requiring a certain minimum lot width, has an area or a width that is less than the width required by the new regulation,, the existing lot of record may be used, subject to the following exceptions and modifications: 
                  (1)  Adjoining lots. When two or more adjoining lots of record with continuous frontage are in one ownership at any time after the adoption or amendment of this chapter and such lots, individually, have an area or width that is less than required by this chapter, such groups of lots may be considered as a single lot or several lots of the minimum width and area required in the district in which they are located 
                  (2)  Individual lot not meeting minimum lot size requirements. Except as set forth in subsection (1) of this section, in any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, any lot of record existing at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, which has an area, width or depth less than that required by this chapter, may be used as a building site for a single-family dwelling. In the case of such a lot, when it is not possible to provide the required side yards and at the same time build a minimum width single-family dwelling, the planning commission is hereby authorized to reduce the side yard requirements for such lot the minimum amount necessary for a reasonable dwelling, but in no case shall each of the side yards be less than five feet in width.

If the builder would like to request an extension of time, they would need to receive a permit of approval from the city manager. No trailer, mobile home or manufactured home will be permitted for use as a permanent commercial building. This regulation does not exclude the use of manufactured commercial buildings that are set on a permanent slab foundation.

                  (1)  Extended to occupy a greater area of land. 
                  (2)  Extended to occupy a greater area of a building or structure unless such additional area of the building or structure existed at the time of the passage or amendment of this chapter and was clearly designed to house the same use as the nonconforming use occupying the other portion of the building or structure. 
                  (3)  Re-established after discontinuance for six months. Nothing herein shall be considered to approve or give legality to any nonconforming use which has been discontinued more than six months within the city. The holding of an occupational tax certificate does not in itself constitute continuance of a business. 
                  (4)  Changed to another nonconforming use in a different zoning classification without approval of application for rezoning.

               <p>                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 114-1. - Planned unit developments. 
                  (a)  Purpose of planned unit developments. 
                  (1)  The purpose of planned unit developments (PUDs) is to encourage the best possible site plans and building arrangements under a unified plan of development rather than under a lot-by-lot regulation. The developer benefits from better land utilization, economy in the provision of roads and utilities and the flexibility in design. The city gains the advantages of a variety of building types, compatibility of uses and optimum community development. Review of the development plans by the planning and zoning commission and formal approval by the mayor and city council provides an opportunity to assure that the development will be in harmony with the character of the neighborhood in which the development is located. 
                  (2)  The planned unit development is not intended to encourage greater density of development but rather to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning. Furthermore, the planned unit development is not intended to enhance the value of property for speculative purposes. Approval of a planned unit development is therefore conditional, and if construction is not commenced within one year, and/or pursued in an orderly manner toward completion, the mayor and city council may, upon written notice to the property owner, abolish the zoning or reduce the size of the tract to fit the scope of actual development. All planned unit developments will be approved as a conditional use based upon detailed plans submitted. No changes to the approved plan may be made without review by the planning commission and approval by the mayor and city council. 
                  (b)  Ownership control. All of the land in a planned unit development shall be owned initially by an individual, corporation or by some legal entity. Individual properties in a planned unit development may be sold after a plat has been recorded with the properties subject to private deed covenants that assure the continuance of the planned unit development as originally approved and developed. 
                  (Code 1996, § 82-86(a), (c); Ord. of 3-8-1999, pt. II, art. 10) 
                  Sec. 114-2. - Administrative/approval process. 
                  (a)  Approval required. All requests for a planned unit development shall be reviewed by the planning and zoning commission and approved by the mayor and city council as a conditional development requiring a zoning decision. This will require that the application be received and processED with the same formality as to notice, posting and hearing as a rezoning application. 
                  (b)  Required standards of submitted documents. All plats, plans, reports, etc., submitted must meet all of the requirements of the subdivision regulations; design and construction standards; land use requirements; and other development standards as set forth in the land development code, as may be amended or varied, with approval of the mayor and city council as provided for in this chapter, pursuant to the requirements outlined in this chapter and in order to accomplish the purpose and intent of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Additional requirements for proposed PUD developments. In addition to any plans required by the land development code, developers of PUD developments must also submit the following plans, showing any required improvements for the PUD development in its entirety: 
                  (1)  Preliminary PUD site plan showing the requested PUD in its entirety including all districts and the requested zoning of each district; 
                  (2)  Provision of infrastructure plan including streets, water, sewer, etc., that might be expected to be reasonably impacted by this development; 
                  (3)  Pedestrian/bicycle access plan; 
                  (4)  Parking plan; 
                  (5)  Open space and vegetation preservation plan; 
                  (6)  Landscaping plan; 
                  (7)  Street lighting plan; 
                  (8)  Phased construction plan including the statement of expiration of PUD approval. 
                  (d)  Approval process of a proposed planned unit development. 
                  (1)  Pre-application conference. 
                  a.  Within 30 days of submission of the application for request of approval for a planned unit development, a public hearing will be scheduled. At least 15 days of notice of the time, place and request will be provided by publishing a notice in the newspaper of general circulation in the city. Attendance at this hearing is required by the owner/developer. 
                  b.  City staff will have 30 days in order to compile comments generated at the public hearing for PUD request and to complete their review of the proposed project. 
                  c.  Planning and zoning commission first reading; advertisement of the request. 
                  d.  Planning and zoning commission second/public hearing; PUD request recommendation. 
                  e.  Mayor and council public hearing; approval/disapproval. 
                  (2)  If the planned unit development request is approved by the mayor and council, then; 
                  a.  Concept plan approval for the planned unit development by the planning and zoning commission. 
                  b.  Individual district concept plan approval by planning and zoning commission. 
                  (e)  Expiration of PUD approval. Approval of a planned unit development is conditional. If significant construction is not commenced within 18 months of the date of the approval of the PUD by the mayor and council and thereafter pursued in an orderly fashion toward completion, or there is any lapse in construction for a period of 12 months, the mayor and council may, after providing 30 days' written notice to the property owner, abolish the entirety of the conditional PUD zoning or terminate the PUD as to portions or districts of the property contained within the originally approved PUD area. 
                  This statement must be included on title sheet of the PUD request and the phased construction plan of the rezoning request. 
                  (f)  Approval required for changes to an approved PUD. All planned unit developments will be approved as a conditional use based upon detailed plans submitted including timeframes for commencing construction and continuation of substantial construction progress. No material changes to the approved plan may be made without review by the planning commission and approval by the mayor and city council. Any variances requested for any portion of development within a PUD shall be brought before the planning and zoning commission in order to seek a recommendation prior to meeting with the board of appeals. 
                  (g)  Planned unit development approval request fees. 
                  (1)  Any taxes, fees, or other liabilities of the land within this request must be paid before the approval process will begin. 
                  (2)  The application fee, which is established by the mayor and city council and amended from time to time, must be paid upon submission of the planned unit application. 
                  (3)  An approved planned unit development is subject to all other fees associated with the continued development of the project including but not limited to subdivision fees, building permit fees, water/sewer fees, etc.

                  (a)  The site plan, building design, and landscaping of new development should achieve high quality and appearance that will enhance and be compatible with the character of the surrounding area. 
                  (b)  Site planning and design of projects proposed (adjacent to dissimilar land uses) should carefully address the potential undesirable impacts on existing uses. These impacts may include traffic, parking, circulation and safety issues, light and glare, noise, odors, dust control and security concerns.

                  Sec. 114-28. - Protecting the natural environment. 
                  (a)  Evaluate the proposed development's compatibility with the existing environment to determine the limitations and capabilities of the site for development. 
                  (b)  Conserve and protect natural resources, including air quality, trees, natural vegetation, existing topography, streams, creeks, wetlands, watersheds, water quality, and wildlife habitat. Development should be limited to a level that does not exceed the capabilities and requirements of a healthy environment. 
                  (c)  Significant site features such as habitats, natural ground forms, existing site vegetation, large rock outcroppings, water, and significant view corridors should be identified and incorporated into development plans. Where possible, a diversity of habitats is preferred. 
                  (d)  Riparian zones, stream corridors, and wetlands should be protected for their wildlife habitat and other values. Development plans for these areas should treat these components as assets. A continuous, connected, natural vegetative corridor should be preserved along all creek and stream corridors to provide stream quality protection and for the efficient movement of wildlife throughout the area. No fill, removal, or modification of a riparian area should take place, unless there is no reasonable and feasible alternative. The alteration or improvement of significant natural resource areas, where permitted, should ensure that potential losses are mitigated and best management practices are employed to minimize permanent damage. (See Figure.)

                  (e)  Existing vegetation should be retained to the maximum extent possible. Clearing of native vegetation should be limited to that required for the provision of essential purposes (i.e., access, building, sewage disposal, etc.). Where appropriate, existing native vegetation should be enhanced with plantings of the same variety. 
                  (f)  Preserve patches of high-quality habitat, as large and circular as possible, feathered at the edges, and connected by wildlife corridors. (See Figure.)

                  Sec. 114-29. - Site grading. 
                  (a)  Developments should be designed to fit the existing contours and landform of the site and to minimize the amount of earthwork. Excavation and earthwork should be kept to a minimum to reduce visual impacts and erosion. Where cut and fill is required, balancing the cut and fill is highly encouraged. 
                  (b)  Abrupt or unnatural-appearing grading is strongly discouraged. Avoid the creation of harsh, easily eroded banks and cuts. 
                  (c)  The height and length of retaining walls should be minimized and screened with appropriate landscaping. Tall, smooth-faced concrete retaining walls should be avoided in highly visible areas. Terracing should be considered as an alternative to the use of tall or prominent retaining walls, particularly in highly visible areas on hillsides. 
                  (d)  Disturbed areas that are not used for roads, buildings, or other auxiliary uses should be replanted.

                  Sec. 114-31. - PUD residential districts. 
                  (a)  Description. The residential districts within a PUD are intended to provide for predominantly residential but mixed-use developments that are designed according to the principles of "new urbanism" with a grid or modified-grid street network, pedestrian scale and orientation, shallow front yards, relatively narrow local streets planted with shade trees and provided with wide sidewalks, and with automobile garages accessed via alleys or located to the rear of residential lots. PUD residential districts are further distinguished from conventional suburban subdivision developments in their provision of public greens or common areas. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk. 
                  Consistent: grid pattern of blocks and streets. The PUD residential development consists of a recognizable pattern of diverse land uses. Park blocks or greens are dispersed, usually with a random rather than regular pattern. Moving away from the commercial districts, office uses and higher density residential uses (which may or may not be permitted in a given PUD project), stepping down further in intensity and density, the more outlying blocks in the PUD residential development are detached, single-family dwellings on their own lots, usually fairly narrow in width (50—70 feet). Alley access is encouraged and may be required. School and/or church sites are a part of the neighborhood "fabric." Image referenced below is available from the city clerk. 
                  Consistent (above): "Cottage"" or small houses located close to the street, with gabled roofs and front porches, and with garage access at rear of lot. Accessory apartment above garage (subject to limitations). Image referenced below is available from the city clerk. 
                  Consistent: Dwelling contains front porch and is located close to street. Minimal side yard setbacks. Garage is detached at located at rear of lot. Lot size is 50—60 feet in width and approximately 100—130 feet in depth (4,000 to 16,000 square feet of lot area). Image referenced below is available from the city clerk. 
                  Consistent: House with front porch close to street. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk. 
                  Consistent: PUD street view: The original settlement pattern sets the character and establishes building themes that should be continued, including location of buildings close to the street and porches on the front of dwellings. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk. 
                  Consistent: Streets with street trees and sidewalks. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk. 
                  Consistent: Three-story, higher density dwelling designed to face a green; buildings abut the sidewalk. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk. 
                  Consistent: Townhouses have auto access to the rear of the lots via an alley, if permitted or conditionally permitted. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk. 
                  (b)  Pedestrian access and sidewalks. The site plan must demonstrate that the project will be designed in a way that gives preference to pedestrian (including transit users, where transit is available) versus vehicular access. To this end, the applicant shall identify and present a pedestrian access plan that provides pedestrian access connections to compatible adjacent properties and the public sidewalk system. Sidewalks meeting or exceeding local construction specifications shall be provided by the developer along all streetscapes abutting road corridors. Sidewalks meeting said specifications shall also be required to be installed by the developer along all other streets abutting the development area and along public and private through streets within the developments. 
                  (c)  Streetscape improvements. The site plan of proposed development must demonstrate that the development will comply with the streetscape improvements. Where not taken up by a building, the first ten feet of private property abutting the right-of-way of the street shall be improved as a streetscape with an appropriate combination of the following elements: one or more pedestrian plazas or public use areas containing benches and shelters; amenity features such as low-lying walls or fountains; landscaping including street/shade trees; pedestrian-scale signage and development identification monuments; bicycle parking facilities; and steps or landings leading to buildings with retail or office-institutional uses on the ground floor with storefront windows. The local government may require a general purpose utility and streetscape easement of ten feet in width if needed along the road right-of-way if additional right-of-way is needed and cannot be acquired. 
                  (d)  Maximum building setback. Buildings shall be placed close to (with little if any setback from) streets internal to the development, and along public streets abutting the development area, as determined in the site plan review and approval process. 
                  (e)  Residential uses and open spaces. Residential areas should be designed in a grid-like pattern of blocks and interconnecting streets. Block length should not exceed 800 feet without intervening (mid-block) pedestrian access ways. Central residential areas should be designed in a grid-like pattern of blocks and interconnecting streets and alleys, and block length should not exceed 500 feet. Open spaces, such as town greens and public squares, should be located and designed to add to the visual amenities of the neighborhood and individual development. Greens and squares should be spatially defined and distributed throughout the village so that no lot is more than a walking distance of 2,000 feet from a green, square, park, or designated open space. Greens and squares should not be less than 8,000 square feet in area. 
                  (f)  Non-residential and mixed uses. Enclosed retail trade establishments, personal service establishments, and related non-residential uses, if proposed and permitted, shall be located in careful relation to other land uses within and outside of the development. Such uses must be scaled to the pedestrian and to the district itself. The storefront area should contain retail uses, professional offices, and personal or professional services in 1½ story buildings where each individual establishment is typically 1,500 square feet or less, and up to 3,500 square feet when located in buildings of two or more stories. Buildings containing residential units, usually on an upper story (i.e., vertical mixed-use development) are particularly encouraged. Storefront buildings should have at least 60 feet of their front facade coincident with their street frontage. Preferably, storefront buildings fronting the same street and located on the same block should be attached on the sides, except as necessary to accommodate pedestrian ways. 
                  (Ord. No. 2009-12-14, § 4.4, 12-14-2009) 
                  Sec. 114-32. - PUD Commercial District. 
                  (a)  Description. This district establishes and maintains areas of commerce that are designed first and foremost with attention to the pedestrian rather than the automobile. Sidewalks are wide enough for significant pedestrian activity and auto and truck access is limited in areas of pedestrian activity. Buildings frame the street by being located close to the street and with a height of at least two stories. The buildings, many of which are retail shops, have awnings and storefront windows that add interest to pedestrians. Signs are smaller and closer to the ground, rather than being sized and located to attract motorists. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk. 
                  Consistent: Two-story or taller building heights, canopies and awnings, wide sidewalks with street trees; on-street parking. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk. 
                  Consistent: Building frames the street. Sidewalk provided. Street tree planting strip in between on-street parking and the sidewalk. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk. 
                  Consistent: Storefront retail spaces have awnings and are located abutting a wide sidewalk. On-street parking and street trees. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk. 
                  (b)  Building placement. Buildings should be placed close to (with little if any setback from) streets internal to the development, or along public streets abutting the development area, as determined in the development review and approval process. The buildings should be generally placed so that the main entrance is oriented to the street sidewalk. Image referenced below is available from the city clerk. 
                  (c)  Ground floors. The ground level of multi-story buildings should contain retail or entertainment uses with direct entry from the street to provide pedestrian interest along sidewalks. Pedestrian interest can be enhanced with use of windows, entrances, and architectural details. Pedestrian signage, awnings, and ornamentation are encouraged. 
                  Consistent: Storefront windows should be transparent. Mirrored glass, faux windows or display casements are strongly discouraged. 

                  Consistent: Grid block pattern. Buildings are not set back much if any from streets and they frame the street frontage and street corners. Two-story height for buildings desirable. Parking is mostly behind buildings (some on-street parking is permitted). 

                  Source: Arendt, Randall, et al. Rural By Design: Maintaining Small Town Character, Figure 9-2, p. 118. (Chicago: Planners Press, 1994). 
                  Inconsistent: Mostly single-story development with parking in the front of buildings. Strip shopping center has little if any articulation (projections and recesses). Individual development sites are not coordinated with one another. 

                  Consistent: Skinny streets (one-way shown) with shade trees. Decorative post-top street lighting is pedestrian scale. Sidewalk constructed of distinctive materials rather than regular concrete or asphalt. Directional sign is small and low to the ground (pedestrian scale).

                  Sec. 114-33. - Mixed-Use/Multi-Family High District. 
                  (a)  Description. This district has many of the same characteristics as the pedestrian retail district, but with greater mix of land uses. The activity center is an organized and pre-planned village center with a mixture of residential, civic/institutional, office, commercial and formal open spaces done following principles of New England-style town planning, new urbanism, traditional neighborhood development, and/or urban planning and redevelopment. 
                  (b)  Land use mix. No less than 20 percent of total gross floor area of buildings within this district shall contain commercial/office uses, excluding any building areas that would customarily be considered typical non-unit residential uses (i.e., lobbies and common areas for residential units) 
                  (c)  Live/work units. Mixed-use districts may include live/work units.

                  (Code 1996, § 70-79; Ord. of 12-12-2005(1)) 
                  Sec. 116-89. - Variances to sign requirements. 
                  (a)  The development appeals board is hereby empowered to vary or adapt the strict application of some of the requirements of this chapter. A variance may be appropriate where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape or by reason of other exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary and exceptional situations or conditions on a piece of property, the strict application of the regulations enacted under this chapter would result in peculiar, exceptional, and undue hardship on the owner of such property. The sections of the chapter subject to consideration for variance would include, but not necessarily be limited to issues involving sign setback, sign height, sign placement and/or sign type. The following regulations enacted in this article are not subject to variance: maximum allowable square footage of sign area, total number of signs allowed per lot, maximum allowable total sign square footage allowed per site and regulations that protect public safety. 
                  (b)  After denial of a sign permit by the building official, the sign contractor, billboard company, or property owner may apply to the hearings board for a variance by filing a form to be obtained from the codes enforcement department. No variance in the strict application of the provisions of this article shall be granted by the hearings board unless it finds that an undue and unreasonable hardship will be caused to the property owner or sign company owner by the strict enforcement and interpretation of the requirements and standards detailed in this chapter. In general, the power to authorize a variance from the terms of this article shall be sparingly exercised. It is the intent of this article that the variance be used only to overcome some unusual physical condition of a parcel of land which poses practical difficulty and prevents the owner from obtaining the full use and purpose of the sign as intended by this chapter. Any variance granted shall be the minimum adjustment necessary for the reasonable use of the sign. 
                  (c)  The applicant must show that the variance will not cause harm to adjoining property owners or the general populace, will not be contrary to the public interest, and that practical difficulty and unnecessary hardship will result if it is not granted. The hearings board may prescribe any safeguard that it deems necessary to secure substantially the objectives of the regulations or provisions to which the variance applies.

Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16) of this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading, and other development activities shall be conducted in such a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut and fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type, so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected, and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures must be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of this chapter; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surfaces of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by the means of bridges or culverts, except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (a) of this section; 
                  (15)  a.  There is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except: 
                  1.  As provided by subsections (c)(16) and (17) of this section; 
                  2.  Where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment; 
                  3.  Where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8; 
                  4.  Where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented; 
                  5.  Along any ephemeral stream. As used in this subsection, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: 
                  i.  That under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; 
                  ii.  That has the channel located above the ground water table year-round; 
                  iii.  For which ground water is not a source of water; and 
                  iv.  For which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow; or 
                  6.  Where shoreline stabilization is installed; provided, however, that this exception shall be limited to the construction of bulkheads and sea walls only to the extent required to prevent the erosion of the shoreline. This exception shall be limited to Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair and shall be limited to the duration of such construction. Unless exempted under subsection (c)(15)a.5 of this section, buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq. shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. 
                  b.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within any such buffer; and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed, except as otherwise provided by this subsection. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed. 
                  c.  On or before December 31, 2004, the board shall adopt rules which contain specific criteria for the grant or denial by the director of requests for variances. After such date, no variance shall be granted by the director which is not consistent with the criteria contained in such rules. Such rules shall provide, at a minimum, that the director shall consider granting a variance in the following circumstances: 
                  1.  Where a proposed land-disturbing activity within the buffer would require the landowner to acquire a permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers under Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendment of 1972, 33 USC 1344, and the Corps of Engineers has approved a mitigation plan to be implemented as a condition of such a permit; 
                  2.  Where the landowner provides a plan satisfactory to the director that shows that, even with the proposed land-disturbing activity within the buffer, the completed project will result in maintained or improved water quality downstream of the project; or 
                  3.  Where a project with a proposed land-disturbing activity within the buffer is located in or upstream and within ten linear miles of a stream segment listed as impaired under Section 303(d) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendment of 1972, 33 USC 1313(d) and the landowner provides a plan satisfactory to the director that shows that the completed project will result in maintained or improved water quality in such listed stream segment and that the project has no adverse impact relative to the pollutants of concern in such stream segment. 
                  All projects covered under subsections (c)(15)c.1, 2, and 3 of this section shall meet all criteria set forth in rules for specific variance criteria adopted by the board by December 31, 2004. 
                  d.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board providing for notice to the division or local issuing authority of the location and extent of the piping and prescribed methodology for minimizing the impact of such piping and for measuring the volume of water discharged by the stream. Any such pipe must stop short of the downstream landowner's property, and the landowner must comply with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; 
                  b.  On or before December 31, 2000, the board shall adopt rules which contain specific criteria for the grant or denial by the director of requests for variances. After such date, no variance shall be granted by the director which is not consistent with the criteria contained in such rules; provided, however, that, should the board fail to adopt rules which contain specific criteria for the grant or denial of requests for variances by the director on or before December 31, 2000, the authority of the director to issue such variances shall be suspended until the board adopts such rules; and 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; they cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  a.  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Part 4 of Article 4 of Chapter 5 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970," and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except: 
                  1.  Where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment; 
                  2.  Where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8; 
                  3.  Where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286; 
                  4.  For maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented; 
                  5.  Where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented; 
                  6.  On the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure; and 
                  7.  For the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  b.  No land-disturbing activity shall be conducted within any such buffer and a buffer shall remain in its current, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed, except as otherwise provided by this subsection. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation so long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time so long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat. 
                  c.  On or before December 31, 2015, the board shall promulgate rules and regulations that: 
                  1.  Contain criteria for the grant or denial by the director of requests for variances pursuant to this paragraph, including where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to a permit issued by the United States Army Corps of Engineers under Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, or Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented; and 
                  2.  Provide for variances by rule, subject to specified conditions, for certain categories of activities within the buffer that will have minimal impact on the water quality or aquatic habitat of the adjacent marsh, including where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  The board may adopt rules and regulations that provide for an expedited process for certain categories of activities within the buffer based on the size, scope, location, and character of the proposed activity within the buffer. 
                  e.  The buffer requirements of this section shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  f.  The buffer shall not apply to: 
                  1.  Any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented; or

                  (Code 1996, § 42-74; Ord. of 6-14-2004, § IV; Ord. No. 2011-08-15, § IV, 8-15-2011) 
                  Sec. 118-5. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the land development code, chapters 108, 110, this chapter 118 and 120 and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of city without first obtaining a permit from the city to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the West Georgia Soil and Water Conservation and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 118-5(c). Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 118-4(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed the amount shown on the city fee schedule per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 118-4(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) of this section, has been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 118-4(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this ordinance, any variances required by section 118-4(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this chapter, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this chapter. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Code 1996, § 42-75; Ord. of 6-14-2004, § V; Ord. No. 2011-08-15, § V, 8-15-2011) 
                  Sec. 118-6. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The city will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this ordinance, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975.

                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this ordinance, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order;

The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this ordinance and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 118-5(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. 
                  (1)  Any person who violates any provisions of this chapter, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this chapter, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day.

                  Sec. 118-10. - Liability. 
                  (a)  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this chapter, nor the compliance with provisions of this chapter shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the local issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property. 
                  (b)  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
                  (c)  No provision of this chapter shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby.

Any agreement to sell or transfer land, shall be conditioned upon approval of the plat as provided herein. The use of a description by metes and bounds in the instrument of such a transfer shall not exempt the transaction from the requirements of this chapter. The city attorney may enjoin such transfer or agreement by appropriate action. 
                  (d)  Acceptance of and improvements in unapproved streets. The mayor and council of the city, or other public authority shall not accept, lay out, open, improve, grade, pave, or light any street or lay or authorize the laying of any water mains, sewer, connections or other facilities or utilities in any street within the incorporated area of the city unless such street is approved on engineered construction plans by the city engineer or unless the street has attained legal status of a public street prior to the effective date of this or a prior subdivision resolution; provided however, that the mayor and council of the city may locate, construct or accept any street by resolution. 
                  (e)  Erection of buildings.

                  (1)  A performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or a certified cashier check shall be forwarded to the city, directly from the bonding agent or bank, prior to the start of construction, if the developer does not, intend to complete all roadway and infrastructure improvements prior to obtaining any building permits. Should, the developer find it necessary once infrastructure and road construction has begun to start building, then at that time, any of the above financial vehicles shall be accepted to cover 100 percent of the remaining portions of roadway and infrastructure improvements, before any building permit will be issued. The performance bond shall be issued to the city, by the developer's financial representative at a cost of 100 percent of the estimated cost of infrastructure, and buffer zone improvements, as calculated by the city engineer. If, substantial progress has not been made toward completion of the project, during the first nine months after the construction plans have been approved, a written notice will be sent to the developer expressing the city's concern and 30 days shall be given for the developer to appropriately address the city's concern. The bond shall be executed, only if the staff, the city attorney and council determines that the project or subdivision will be abandoned before completion. The bond is only to ensure the completion of the proposed infrastructure and buffer zone improvements for the given subdivision or project and to eliminate the possibility of current or future taxpayers paying for the uncompleted improvements. 
                  (2)  If the subdivider develops a sufficiently large tract of land in phases a performance bond or other adequate financial vehicle shall be issued for each respective phase following the above format. Building permits shall only be issued for phases containing completed infrastructure improvements unless the above financial vehicles are in place. 
                  (b)  Maintenance bond. 
                  (1)  A subdivider must have completed 100 percent of the infrastructure and road improvements, and maintenance the subdivision for a period of not less than two years, following the filing of the plat of record. A maintenance bond shall be issued to the city at the time the final plat is filed, pending the city engineer's approval of all infrastructure improvements. The maintenance bond shall be based on 50 percent of the estimated cost of construction as calculated by the city engineer, through current cost estimates based on a regional or state wide basis. The bond shall be issued to the city for repairs and corrective actions neglected by the subdivider. 
                  (2)  The maintenance bond shall remain in effect for two years; six months prior to the termination of the maintenance bond the city engineer shall perform a re-inspection of the infrastructure improvements to determine if any corrective action is deemed necessary. Should the city engineer's inspection reveal deficiencies, the owner shall be given a written notice within two weeks of the city engineer's inspection. The owner shall then be given two additional weeks to meet with the city engineer to review the findings of said inspection. The owner shall then be given three months to correct any deficiencies, prior to the forfeiture of the maintenance bond to the city. The dedication of the infrastructure to the city shall be contingent upon acceptance by the mayor and council, provided all corrective action have been satisfactorily performed and any fees paid. The termination of said maintenance bond shall immediately be requested by staff at the next regularly scheduled council meeting following the two-year expiration period.

                  Before proceeding with a proposed land subdivision, subdividers are invited and encouraged to consult early and informally with the city engineer and planner. The subdivider may submit sketch plans and data showing existing conditions within the site and in its vicinity and the proposed layout of the subdivision. No fee shall be charged for this review, and no formal application is necessary. The purpose of the pre-application conference is to afford the subdivider an opportunity to avail himself of the advice and assistance of the city engineer and planner in order to facilitate the subsequent preparation and approval of subdivision plans. The pre-application conference in no way binds or obligates the city to approve any applicant on the basis of attending the pre-application conference.

                  Sec. 122-4. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Principal or accessory use. A tower and/or antenna is considered a principal use if located on any lot or parcel of land as the sole or primary structure, and is considered an accessory use if located on a lot or parcel shared with different existing primary use or existing structures. An existing use or structure on the same lot or parcel shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with zoning district requirements, including but not limited to setback, buffer and other requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot or parcel shall control, even though the antenna or tower may be located on a leased area within such a lot or parcel. Towers that are considered, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use of structure. 
                  (b)  Five-year plan and inventory of existing sites. To facilitate the co-location of antennas and future land use planning, each applicant seeking to locate a new tower, alternative tower structure or antenna, or modify any such existing structure, shall provide to the community development department an inventory of its existing towers or alternative tower structures, to be upgraded or replaced, and proposed towers or alternative structures. Applicants seeking to erect an amateur radio tower or antenna shall be exempt from this provision. 
                  (1)  The inventory shall include all such structures that are within the jurisdiction of the governing authority; within the city, in whole or in part; or within a neighboring section of Haralson and Carroll Counties which currently is capable of providing coverage or capacity within the city, and shall include specific information about the location (latitude and longitude coordinate), height, design, tower type and general suitability for antenna co-location of each tower or alternative structure, and other pertinent information as may be required by the department. 
                  (2)  If the applicant does not know specific future tower and antenna site location but does know of areas where telecommunication facilities will be needed within the next five years to provide service, the applicant shall list the assessor's blocks contained within the geographic service area and identify each geographic service area with a number that will correspond to the future telecommunication facility site. 
                  (3)  The community development department may share the location of existing telecommunication facility sites with other applicants seeking to locate towers and antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority; provided, however, that the department is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. The location of any proposed telecommunication facility sites will be protected as privileged information if the applicant so requests and if it is considered as such under the applicable laws and legal authority. 
                  (c)  Co-location design requirements. In addition to all applicable building and safety codes, all towers, except amateur radio towers, shall be designed to accommodate the co-location of cellular telecommunication antennas according to the following: 
                  (1)  For towers up to 150 feet in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least three providers or the maximum number of users as determined by the most current technology, whichever is greater; 
                  (2)  For towers greater than 150 feet in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least four providers or the maximum number of users as determined by the most current technology whichever is greater. 
                  (d)  Co-location availability of suitable existing structures. No new tower except amateur radio towers, shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the community development department and city that no existing tower or existing alternative tower structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. All evidence submitted shall be signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professional or qualified industry experts. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the proposed antenna shall consist of one or more of the following: 
                  (1)  That no existing towers or suitable alternative tower structure are located within the geographic antenna placement area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements; 
                  (2)  That existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements; 
                  (3)  That existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's antenna and related equipment; 
                  (4)  That the applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antennas on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna; 
                  (5)  That the cost or contractual provisions required by the tower owner to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing exceed the cost of a new tower development; 
                  (6)  That the applicant adequately demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers or structures unsuitable, other than economic considerations. 
                  (e)  Aesthetics. The guidelines set forth in this section shall govern the design and construction of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this chapter and shall be approved by the administrator and planning and zoning commission.

The lighting shall be dimmed or changed to red lights from sunset to sunrise. 
                  (5)  No signage or other identifying markings of a commercial nature shall be permitted upon any tower or alternative tower structure within the city. 
                  (6)  To the extent practical, telecommunication facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the city or by any state or federal law or agency. 
                  (7)  Access to the tower site shall be restricted so as to minimize visibility of the access. Where possible, existing roads shall be used. When no roads exist, access shall follow the existing contours of the land. 
                  (8)  Other additional requirements may be required as deemed necessary by the zoning administrator, shall be reasonably determine to minimize the visual impact of the site on the surrounding area. 
                  (f)  Setbacks and separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers and alternative tower structures. 
                  (1)  Towers shall be setback a distance equal to the height of the tower from its base to any public right-of-way, occupied structure, or property line of the lot or parcel containing the tower. 
                  (2)  Guy-wires and accessory buildings and facilities shall meet the minimum accessory use location and setback requirements of the zoning district. 
                  (3)  In zoning districts other than I and M, towers shall not be located closer than 2,000 feet from any existing tower. This requirement shall not apply to amateur radio towers. 
                  (g)  Security fencing and anti-climbing devices. All towers and supporting equipment shall be enclosed by fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with appropriate anti-climbing devices. Fencing shall be chainlink, wood or other approved alternative. 
                  (h)  Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern landscaping surrounding all towers. 
                  (1)  Where adequate vegetation is not present, tower facilities shall be landscaped with a landscaped strip of plant materials which effectively screens the view of the tower compound. Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of ten feet in width and located outside the fenced perimeter of the compound. 
                  (2)  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be utilized. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
                  (3)  Landscaping shall be maintained by the provider and shall be subject to periodic review by the administrator to ensure proper maintenance. Failure to maintain landscaping shall be deemed a violation of this chapter. 
                  Amateur radio towers and antennas, or receiver-only antennas shall not be subject to the provisions of this section unless required by the city through the conditional use permit process. 
                  (i)  Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street, utilizing existing access to the property on which such facility is to be located, where possible. 
                  (j)  Review of tower and antenna erection by the airport authority. If, upon receipt of an application for the erection of any tower or alternative tower structure governed by this chapter, the department deems that the proposed structure may interfere with or affect the use of airways of the county by the public or interfere with the effect of the operation of existing or proposed airport facilities, a copy of the application shall be submitted by the department to the airport authority for review and recommendation. 
                  (k)  Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with authority to regulated towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the permittee or lessee of the tower and antenna governed by this chapter shall bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations unless a more or less stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall be deemed to be a declaration of abandonment of the tower and constitute grounds for removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's, permittee's or lessee's expense. Any such removal by the city shall be in the manner provided by the city's unsafe or unfit property ordinance then in effect. 
                  (l)  Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee of a tower or alternative tower structure shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the department concludes that a tower fails to comply with all applicable codes and standards, or constitutes a danger to persons or property then upon receipt of written notice by the owner, permittee or lessee of the tower, said party shall have 15 days to bring the tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance within 15 days shall be deemed a declaration of abandonment of the tower and constitute grounds for removal of the tower as provided in the city unsafe or unfit property ordinance. Prior to be removal of any tower, the department may consider detailed plans submitted by the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee for repair of substandard towers, and may grant a reasonable extension of the above-referenced compliance period.

                  (Code 1996, § 87-36; Ord. of 10-12-1998, art. 84.6) 
                  Sec. 122-7. - Conditional use permit. 
                  (a)  General. 
                  (1)  If the proposed location, height, setback or other aspect of a proposed tower or antenna cannot comply with the minimum requirements established in this chapter, then a conditional use permit shall be required for the construction of a tower or the placement of an antenna in any zoning district. All such uses shall comply with the requirements set forth in this chapter and all other applicable codes and ordinances, unless the applicant can show that the denial of a permit in such a location will cause a significantly harmful and permanent degradation of service which cannot be overcome by any other means including planned or potential locations which would provide the same or similar coverage or capacity. 
                  (2)  In granting a conditional use permit, the city may impose conditions to the extent that it concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize adverse effects from the proposed tower on adjoining or nearby properties as set out in subsection (f) of this section. 
                  (b)  Application, contents/fee. All applications for conditional use permits shall be submitted to the city community development department. Each application shall contain as part thereof detailed plans and specifications as set forth in section 122-5. An application for a conditional use permit shall not be accepted for processing without the information required in section 122-5. An application fee shall be charged by the department in the amount specified in section 122-10. 
                  (c)  Co-location of antenna required. Applicants for the erection of a tower or antenna, except amateur radio operators, shall be required to co-locate upon an existing tower structure. An exception to co-location shall only be made if the applicant adequately demonstrates that an existing tower suitable for co-location does not exist in the geographic antenna placement area, and that no suitable alternative tower structure is available as set forth in section 122-4(d). 
                  (d)  Independent expert review. The city may engage a licensed professional engineer as an independent expert to review any of the materials submitted by an applicant for a conditional use permit and render an opinion regarding any concerns about the proposal, including but not limited to, structural integrity and the feasibility of alternative sites or co-locations. Following the review of an independent expert, the city shall convey its concerns to the applicant in writing and shall allow the applicant a reasonable opportunity to address those concerns. If the applicant is unable to satisfactorily address those concerns, the applicant shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed 30 days, following the receipt of the letter, in which to modify the application to alleviate the city's concerns or withdraw the application altogether. The expert's opinion shall be considered determinative, unless the applicant agrees to pay the expenses of submitting both opinions for peer review, which review shall then be considered final. If the independent third-party expert supports the applicant's expert, then the city shall pay the expenses of said third-party expert. If the third-party expert supports the position of the department, then the applicant shall pay the expenses of said third-party expert. No permit shall be issued until the applicant has paid all expenses incurred by the city under this section. 
                  (e)  Public hearing. Before taking action upon the proposed conditional use permit, the city shall hold a public hearing on the matter, as provided for in section 100-10 of the land development code, and the provisions herein. At least 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing, the city shall cause the following notice to requirements to be instituted by the department: 
                  (1)  A sign shall be erected, in a conspicuous location, on or adjacent to the property under consideration. The sign shall state the time, place location and purpose of the public hearing. 
                  (2)  A letter shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to all property owners of record on abutting parcels, and to all property owners of residentially used parcels lying in whole or in part within a distance of two times the height of the proposed tower as measured from its base, giving notice of the public hearing. The letter shall state the same information as required for the sign. (Reliance on the tax assessor's records may not provide the applicant with the most recent owners of record.) 
                  (3)  A public notice shall be published in the newspaper and must appear once a week for two consecutive weeks prior to the date of the public hearing. 
                  (4)  Subsections (e)(2) and (3) of this section shall be the responsibility of, and at the expense of, the applicant. 
                  (f)  Considerations in approval or denial of conditional use permits.

                  (9)  The impact of the proposed tower or antenna upon scenic views and visual quality of the surrounding area; 
                  (10)  The needs of applicant as balanced against the potential detrimental effects on surrounding properties; and 
                  (11)  The impact of the proposed tower or antenna on adjacent and nearby properties.

                  (4)  The city determines that the benefits and needs for the proposed conditional use are greater than any possible depreciating effects or damages to neighboring or nearby properties; and 
                  (5)  All fees, including expert fees, have been paid in full. 
                  (h)  Resubmitting of conditional use application.
