PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Hampton, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the mayor and council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of John Dombroski, Vice President of Production and Peggy Lamar, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Elaine Haynes, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

                  Sec. 2-37. - Emergency sessions. 
                  When emergency circumstances occur, the council may hold a meeting with less than 24 hours' notice to the public. When such meetings are to be held, the clerk shall provide notice to the legal organ of the city or a newspaper with a general circulation at least equal to that of the legal organ and to each member of the city council as soon as possible.

                  A quorum, as defined in the Charter as the mayor and four members of council or the mayor pro-tem and three members of council, must be present for conducting all meetings of the council. It is the duty of the mayor to enforce this rule. Any council member may raise a point of order directed to the mayor if he or she believes that a quorum is not present. If, at the beginning of a meeting or during the course of a meeting, one or more council members leave and a quorum does not exist, the meeting cannot start or continue. If a quorum is not attained within 30 minutes, the meeting will be rescheduled by the mayor with the approval of the council members present.

                  A council member shall vote on all motions unless he has a conflict of interest which would prevent him from making a decision in a fair and legal manner. If a conflict of interest does exist, the council member shall explain for the record his decision to abstain on any vote. Additionally, all council members must comply with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-2 regarding disclosure of conflicts of interests in zoning actions. 
                  Sec. 2-42. - Agenda.

In the case of a roll-call vote, the name of each council member voting for or against a proposal shall be recorded. It shall be presumed that a council member has voted in the affirmative unless the minutes show otherwise. More detailed information may be included in the minutes at the request of the council. 
                  (b)  The council must approve the minutes before they can be considered as an official record of the council. A copy of the minutes from the previous meeting shall be distributed to the council members at least one business day before the following meeting. The minutes of the previous meeting shall be corrected and approved by the council at the beginning of each meeting. A majority vote is required for approval.

                  (a)  All council members must conduct themselves in a professional and respectful manner. All remarks should be directed to the mayor and not to individual council members, staff or citizens in attendance. Personal remarks are inappropriate.

                  (b)  The mayor shall enforce these rules of decorum. If a council member believes that a rule has been broken, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required.

                  Any amendments to the rules of order must be submitted by a council member in writing to the city clerk three business days before a regular meeting of the council. The proposed amendment shall be included in the agenda for that meeting and distributed to all council members. All amendments require a two-thirds vote of the council to be adopted. 
                  Sec. 2-49. - Suspending the rules of order. 
                  Rules of order may be suspended in the case of an emergency. A motion to suspend the rules requires a second, is debatable and requires a two-thirds vote of the council. Rules governing quorum, voting methods and requirements, the notification to council members of meetings, and rules necessary for compliance with state law cannot be suspended. 
                  Sec. 2-50. - Visual and sound recordings.

                  Sec. 2-291. - Principle policies. 
                  The public trust requires public servants to fulfill their duties faithfully and honestly and to subordinate any personal interest which conflicts with the public interest. A public servant is a trustee of the people and should strive to further the general welfare and not use public office in order to improve his or her own private standing. The principle policies which form the foundation of this code of ethics are: 
                  (1)  The trust of citizens in their government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity. 
                  (2)  The Constitutions, laws and regulations of the United States and State of Georgia and ordinances of the City of Hampton should be upheld as a de minimus standard of conduct. 
                  (3)  The most effective way to eradicate unethical practices is to consistently act with the highest moral principles and to consistently react appropriately to the ethical decisions of others. 
                  (4)  Public servants should exercise sound judgment and apply ethical principles in making decisions that in any manner reflect upon their office. 
                  (5)  All citizens should be treated with courtesy, impartiality and equality.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 10-31. - Findings; public purpose. 
                  (a)  As a municipality located within the Atlanta Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area which is experiencing rapid growth and change due to urbanization of our county and being familiar with the experiences of other urban and suburban counties and municipalities including, but not limited to, Atlanta, DeKalb County, and Fulton County, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Indianapolis, Indiana, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by this city, the mayor and council take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. 
                  (b)  Moreover, it is the finding of the mayor and council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called nude bars or establishments offering so-called nude entertainment or adult entertainment, leads to an increase in the surrounding area of criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions, blight and diminution in property values. 
                  (c)  Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, and live commercial nudity in general, are disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, and commercial nudity in general, are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described. 
                  (d)  Accordingly, it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to reduce the adverse impact of adult entertainment establishments by limiting the number of such uses, so as to reduce the negative impacts of adult entertainment establishments upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semi-public uses; to insure that adult entertainment establishments do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts; and so as to avoid allowing adult entertainment establishments in heavily used public pedestrian areas. 
                  (e)  Therefore, the limitation of adult entertainment to certain prescribed areas of the city is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment.

The waiver shall be in writing by the community development director pending an administrative review of development plans. 
                  (3)  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the extent feasible; provided, however, that vegetation that causes interference with the antennas or inhibits access to the equipment facility may be trimmed. 
                  (4)  Existing vegetation on site may be used in lieu of required landscaping where approved by the community development director. 
                  (5)  Landscaping shall be confined to the leased area of the WCF wherever feasible. 
                  (6)  Additional landscaping and buffer requirements: 
                  a.  In single-family and two-family residential zoning districts (RA, R-l, R-2, R-3, RD, RM and/or RMH), a ten foot perimeter buffer is required, with a minimum of one tree per 20 lineal feet of buffer, with a minimum of 50 percent being shade trees. Retention of existing trees on site in order to meet this requirement is encouraged. Grass or other ground cover species shall be planted on all areas of the buffer strip required which are not covered by other landscape material. 
                  b.  In the remaining office, commercial, and industrial districts (OI, C-I, C-2, C-3, M-1 and/or M-2), an additional ten foot buffer shall be required, with landscaping provided according to section 18-99 C. 1. 
                  (7)  Maintenance: It will be the responsibility of the owner/tenant to keep all landscaping material (as part of the landscaped area) free from disease and properly maintained in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was established. The owners of the property, and any tenant on the property where buffers and landscaping are required, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping materials. Such maintenance shall include all actions necessary to keep the buffer and landscape areas free from litter and debris, to keep plantings healthy, and to keep planting areas neat in appearance. Any vegetation that constitutes part of the buffer or landscaping shall be replaced in the event it dies. 
                  (d)  Aesthetics, placement, materials and color. 
                  (1)  Attached WCFs shall have both antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment that are of a neutral color identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  (2)  WCFs with support structures shall consist of towers with a galvanized steel finish, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, in the C-3, M- 1 and M-2 zoning districts. In the remaining zoning districts (RA, R-l, R-2, R-3, RD, RM, RMH, OI, C-l, C-2), WCFs with support structures shall consist of towers with a galvanized steel finish that, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, shall be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. At a tower site, the design of the building and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. WCFs with support structures shall be of the monopole variety except when providers can document and demonstrate need for lattice-type towers. 
                  (e)  Separation requirement. In zoning districts other than general/heavy commercial and industrial (C-2, C-3, M-1, M-2), WCFs over 150 feet in height shall not be located within one-quarter of a mile from any existing WCF that is over 150 feet in height. This requirement may be waived upon evidence provided to the community development director by the applicant that the nearest tower cannot support any new antenna arrays. 
                  (f)  Lighting. All WCFs shall be lighted consistent with FAA regulations for tower illumination regardless of height. Any objection by the applicant based on FAA restrictions shall be presented in writing to the community development director. 
                  (g)  Noise. No equipment shall be operated at a WCF so as to produce noise which would constitute a nuisance based on local or state laws, except for in emergency situations requiring the use of a backup generator, where the noise standards may be exceeded on a temporary basis, not to exceed 14 days. No generator shall be used for regular WCF operations prior to commercial power being delivered to the site. 
                  (h)  Security fencing. WCFs with support structures shall be enclosed by a security fence of neutral color not less than six feet in height. The support structure shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device. 
                  (i)  Radio frequency emissions. The Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (FTA) gives the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) sole jurisdiction of the field of regulation of radio frequency (RF) emissions and WCFs which meet the FCC standards shall not be conditioned or denied on the basis of RF impacts. 
                  (j)  Federal requirements. All WCFs must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the WCFs governed by this article shall bring such antenna arrays and/or support structures into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective dates of such standards and regulations. Failure to bring WCFs into compliance with such revised standards and regulation shall constitute grounds for the removal of the WCF at the owner's expense by utilizing the bond required in section 18-103. 
                  (k)  Structural integrity. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the Electronic Industries Association/Telecommunications Industries (EIA/TIA) 222 Revision F Standard entitled Structural Standards for Steel Antenna Towers and Antenna Supporting Structures (or equivalent), as amended from time to time. A letter stamped by an engineer certified in the State of Georgia shall be required stating that the WCF and Support Structure meets or exceeds all applicable requirements set forth herein. If, upon inspection, the governing authority concludes a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the tower's owner, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the governing authority may remove such tower at the owner's expense by utilizing the bond required in section 18-103.

                  Sec. 18-142. - Findings and intent. 
                  This article is adopted to address the interest of public safety. 
                  (1)  The governing authority finds that there is a need to establish a foreclosure and vacant real property registry as a mechanism to protect property values in neighborhoods for all property owners. 
                  (2)  Due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are foreclosed or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure, the property values and quality of life of neighboring properties are negatively impacted. 
                  (3)  Improperly maintained and secured foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of foreclosed real property. The governing authority finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in this article. 
                  (4)  This foreclosure and vacant real property registry will require owners and agents to provide the city with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing foreclosed and vacant real property into compliance with applicable provisions of the Hampton City Code.

The rules of evidence and examination of witnesses shall be the same as in the superior courts, so far as such rules are applicable to the case on trial. All officers, informers and persons injured shall be competent witnesses. In general, the municipal court shall be controlled by the rules of practice governing the superior courts, so far as they are applicable to municipal courts, and by a sound construction of the Charter and ordinances of the city.

                  Sec. 40-31. - Definitions. 
                  [The following definitions, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
                  Alarm signal means a detectible signal, either audible or visual, generated by an alarm system, to which the city police department is expected to respond. 
                  Alarm system means any device or assembly of equipment designed to signal the occurrence of an illegal entry or other event requiring immediate attention and to which the city police department is expected to respond, but does not include alarms installed in motor vehicles or fire alarms. 
                  Alarm systems coordinator means an employee of the city designated by the city council to administer this article. 
                  Alarm user means any person, corporation, partnership, proprietorship, governmental or educational entity or any other entity owning or leasing an alarm system or on whose premises an alarm system is maintained for the protection of such premises. 
                  Automatic dial protection device means an automatic dialing device or an automatic telephone dialing alarm system and shall include any system which, upon being activated, automatically initiates to the county "911" emergency communications center a recorded message or code signal indicating a need for emergency response. 
                  False alarm means the activation of an alarm system through mechanical or electrical failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence or improper activation by the alarm user, his employees or agents, and false signals activated to summon law enforcement or emergency personnel unless response was canceled by the alarm user or his agent before personnel are dispatched to the alarm location. A false alarm shall not include an alarm which can reasonably be determined to have been caused or activated for the first time by unusual conditions of nature nor does it include other extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to the control of the alarm user. In addition, an alarm activated during an alarm system testing procedure shall not be considered a false alarm if the alarm user first notifies and receives permission from the alarm systems coordinator to test the system. An alarm is false within the meaning of this article when, upon investigation or inspection by city employees, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, burglary, robbery, or such other crime was committed or attempted and no fire or other emergency existed in or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system.

                  Request for review. The alarm systems coordinator shall, when requested by an alarm user, review the determination that an alarm was false. Such review shall be conducted by the alarm systems coordinator only if the alarm user requests in writing such a review within ten days of the date the alarm user was notified of the false alarm determination. The written request for review of a false alarm determination by the alarm systems coordinator shall include the following information: 
                  (1)  Alarm user name;

                  (2)  The fifth false alarm within a fiscal year shall result in the alarm user being assessed a $50.00 civil penalty, which shall be paid within 30 days from receipt of the assessment notice. 
                  (3)  The sixth false alarm within a fiscal year and all future alarms thereafter shall result in the alarm user cited to appear before the municipal court of the city to be assessed a civil penalty not to exceed $500.00. 
                  (c)  Remedy for refusal to pay assessments or to take remedial action. If an alarm user is assessed civil penalties for excessive false alarms and refuses either to pay the same or to make immediate remedial action so that excessive false alarms cease, then the city shall be authorized to bring an action in the municipal court of the city to abate the nuisance pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5.

                  Sec. 42-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities.

As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15), (16) and (17) below, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, re-grading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraphs (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year-round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer, and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970" and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 342, § 1, 6-15-10 Ord. No. 424 , § 1, 9-13-16; Ord. No. 430 , § 1, 1-10-17) 
                  Sec. 42-35. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, the ordinance codified in this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Hampton without first obtaining a permit from City of Hampton Community Development Department and Building Department, or other appropriate city official, to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City of Hampton Community Development Department and Building Department, or other appropriate city official, and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 42-34(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by ten copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 42-34(c)(15), (16) and (17) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) below of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 42-34(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate "erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist," established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable, but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 42-34(c)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Ord. No. 342, § 1, 6-15-10 Ord. No. 424 , § 1, 9-13-16; Ord. No. 430 , § 1, 1-10-17) 
                  Sec. 42-36. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The City of Hampton Community Development Department and Building Department, or other appropriate city official, will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The City of Hampton Community Development Department and Building Department, or other appropriate city official, shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials; nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning. 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order. 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed and maintained, a stop-work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop-work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 42-35(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city Charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  (1)  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this article, nor the compliance with provisions of this article shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the local issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property. 
                  (2)  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (3)  No provision of this article shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby.

                  Sec. 46-21. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Hampton are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
                  (c)  Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can: (1) protect human life and health; (2) minimize damage to private property; (3) minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and (4) minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
                  (d)  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a), have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city does ordain the ordinance from which this chapter derives, and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property. 
                  (Ord. No. 285, § 2, 12-11-07) 
                  Sec. 46-22. - Purpose and intent. 
                  The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; and 
                  (6)  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.

                  Start of construction means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, including a manufactured home, or a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land resulting in one or more new lots or building sites for the purpose, whether immediately or in the future, of sale, other transfer of ownership or land development, and includes divisions of land resulting from or made in connection with the layout or development of a new street or roadway or a change in an existing street or roadway. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means: (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the city's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certificates, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 46-52. - General standards. 
                  (a)  No development shall be allowed within the future-conditions floodplain that could result in any of the following: 
                  (1)  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
                  (2)  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity; 
                  (3)  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or 
                  (4)  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
                  (b)  Any development within the future-conditions floodplain allowed under subsection (a) above shall also meet the following conditions: 
                  (1)  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average groundwater table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average groundwater table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (predevelopment) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
                  (2)  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
                  (3)  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
                  (4)  Verification of no-rise conditions (0.01 foot or less), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of section 46-53; 
                  (5)  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from floodwaters; and 
                  (6)  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision ("CLOMR"), or conditional letter of map amendment ("CLOMA"), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the department designated by the mayor and council of the city using the community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval.

                  Sec. 46-53. - Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. 
                  An engineering study is required, as appropriate, to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of section 46-59 apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the State of Georgia and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the department designated by the mayor and council of the city prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
                  (1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
                  (2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the department designated by the mayor and council of the city. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles; 
                  (3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; and 
                  (4)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments.

                  Sec. 46-54. - Floodway encroachments. 
                  Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (2) below; 
                  (2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the preproject base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
                  (3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the department designated by the mayor and council of the city until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision ("CLOMR") is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the department designated by the mayor and council of the city.

                  (7)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (8)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (9)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (10)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them, during flooding; 
                  (11)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced; and 
                  (12)  If the proposed development is located in multiple flood zones or multiple base flood elevation cross the proposed site, the higher or more restrictive base flood elevation or future-condition elevation and development standards shall take precedence.

                  Sec. 46-62. - Variance procedures. 
                  The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter. A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the department designated by the mayor and council of the city, or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated herein above. 
                  (1)  Requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter shall be submitted to the department designated by the mayor and council of the city. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the department designated by the mayor and council of the city. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
                  (2)  Any person adversely affected by any decision of the department designated by the mayor and council of the city shall have the right to appeal such decision in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the mayor and council of the city. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
                  (3)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the department designated by the mayor and council of the city may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Henry County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (7)  In reviewing such requests, the department designated by the mayor and council of the city shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (8)  Conditions for variances: 
                  a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  1.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
                  b.  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  c.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  d.  The department designated by the mayor and council of the city shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (9)  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the department designated by the mayor and council of the city shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request.

                  Note— Section 3. of Ordinance No. 381 states the following, which refers to subsection (6) of this section: "Enforcement of Section 2 deferred. Upon adoption of this Ordinance, the city shall undertake a policy of notifying merchants within the city of the types of drug related objects that this Ordinance prohibits. This notification may include publishing a public notice in the newspaper, posting notice on the city's website, mailings to the city's merchants, or any such other method the city deems appropriate.

                  (a)  If, after notice and a hearing as described in section 54-93, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and is not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  (1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  (b)  For purposes of this article, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair alter, or improve a structure may be considered income. The financial status of the owner shall not be factor in the court's determination.

Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  (Ord. No. 196, § 1, 5-10-05) 
                  Sec. 54-97. - Noncompliance with order and costs. 
                  (a)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure, to be repaired, altered, improved, to be vacated and closed, or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. At any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to the O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable Codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (b)  If the public officer has a structure which has been identified as a nuisance demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the city are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (c)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (d)  The lien provided for in subsection (c) of this section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court of Henry County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(f). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of Henry County and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. 
                  (e)  Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this section, the public officer responsible for enforcement actions in accordance with the section shall transmit to the appropriate county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition, or closure. It shall be the duty of the appropriate county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, who is responsible for or whose duties include the collection of municipal taxes, to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A., Tit. 48, Ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. A county tax commissioner shall collect and enforce municipal liens imposed pursuant to this chapter in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-5-359.1. The county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the county or municipality whose lien is being collected. 
                  (f)  Enforcement of liens pursuant to this Code section shall be initiated at any time following the receipt of the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer of the final determination of costs in accordance with this chapter. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of the final determination of cost in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 or delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this chapter. 
                  (g)  The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this Code section shall be the full amount of the cost as finally determined in accordance with this section together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the governing authority, tax commissioner, municipal tax collector, or city revenue officer in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of the property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. 
                  (h)  The county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-7 et seq., unless such costs are waived by resolution of Henry County. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
                  (i)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county or city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property of the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (j)  Where the abatement action does not commence in the Henry County Superior Court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the Henry County Superior Court as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
                  (k)  The public officers designated herein may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and may seek to enforce such citation in any court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this article. 
                  (l)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.

Such conditions include (without limiting the generality of the foregoing):

                  Sec. 67-121 - General rule. 
                  (a)  Within the zoning districts established by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted there exists: 
                  (1)  Lots, 
                  (2)  Structures, and 
                  (3)  Uses of land and structures, which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendment. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
                  (b)  Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the district involved. A nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this chapter. 
                  (c)  To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption of this chapter. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction.

                  (a)  In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory building may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lots fail to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than these applying to area or width, or both, of the lots shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. 
                  (b)  If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this chapter and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area less than the requirements stated in this chapter.

                  Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter which could not be built under the terms of this chapter due to restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
                  (1)  No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its degree of nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its degree of nonconformity. Notwithstanding any otherwise conflicting provisions contained in this section, any single-family residential structure that is nonconforming, when at least one factor resulting in the nonconforming status of the structure is that its area is less than the minimum established by this chapter, may be enlarged to decrease its degree of nonconformity so long as said enlargement results in no new violation, or increase in the character of an existing violation, of any provision of the City Code, including this chapter. 
                  (2)  Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of a structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (3)  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
                  (4)  An existing, nonconforming mobile home which is lawfully permitted may be replaced with another mobile home consistent with the definition included in this chapter within 60 days from the date of removal of the original mobile home.

                  If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of $1,000.00 or more, or of structures and land in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
                  (1)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located. 
                  (2)  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
                  (3)  If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of structure, or structure and land, may be changed to another nonconforming use, provided that, the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the board of commissioners may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (4)  Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
                  (5)  When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months (except when government action impedes access to the premises), the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
                  (6)  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. "Destruction" for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50 percent of the replacement cost at time of destruction.

                  (a)  For any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming portion of the structure as the case may be, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. 
                  (b)  If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.

                  Sec. 67-159. - Watershed districts. 
                  (a)  Findings and purpose. 
                  (1)  Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within Hampton and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted urban and suburban development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicants, nutrients, and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
                  (2)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the City of Hampton, Henry County and Clayton County; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This section shall apply to the portions of the following watersheds, which occur within the jurisdiction of the City of Hampton and are hereinafter identified as water supply watersheds.

                  (Ord. No. 170, §§ 15, 16, 9-10-02; Ord. No. 170-C, § 1, 11-5-04) 
                  Sec. 67-160. - Conservation residential subdivision. 
                  (a)  Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the meaning prescribed, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: 
                  "Conservation easement" means a nonpossessory interest of a holder in real property imposing limitations or affirmative obligations for the purposes of which include retaining or protecting natural, scenic, green, or open areas of real property, assuring its availability for agricultural, forest, recreational, or green space use, protecting natural resources, maintaining or enhancing air or water quality, or preserving the historical, architectural, archaeological, or cultural aspects of real property. 
                  "Conservation residential subdivision" also known as "CRS" means a single-family residential subdivision design which concentrates lots, dwellings, streets, utilities and related development activities on the more suitable and less environmentally sensitive areas of the site, thereby preserving the steep slopes, wetlands, unsuitable soils, stream corridors and otherwise environmentally sensitive areas in a natural or undisturbed state. A CRS allows for a slightly higher net density than that typically allowed for the underlying zoning classification of the property, and smaller lot sizes in order to preserve the environmentally sensitive areas in dedicated, perpetual green space. 
                  "Density bonus" is the amount of additional density applicable to a type of development in the conservation residential subdivision district according to quality construction standards established herein. 
                  "Dwelling" means a building which is designated or used exclusively to provide a single-family detached residence, exclusive of multifamily dwellings, mobile homes, hotels, motels or manufactured homes. 
                  "Green space" means an area of land within the subdivision boundary which shall remain in a permanent undeveloped condition except for amenities areas. The ownership, uses, limitations of use and maintenance of such land shall be determined through a written management plan to be approved by the City of Hampton at or before approval of the final plat for property which has been approved for a conditional use for a CRS. The green space shall include net usable acres and may include non-useable acres within the gross acreage of the subdivision. 
                  "Holder" means a governmental body empowered to hold an interest in real property under the laws of this state or the United States; or a charitable corporation, charitable association, or charitable trust, the purposes of powers of which include retaining or protecting the natural, scenic, or green space values of real property, assuring the availability of real property for agricultural, forest, recreational, or green space use, protecting natural resources, maintaining or enhancing air or water quality, or preserving the historical, architectural, archaeological, or cultural aspects of real property. 
                  "Master development plan" is a site plan that depicts the proposed subdivision layout including lot dimensions, right-of-way (street) layout, parking facilities, sidewalks, multi-use paths, detention or retention facilities, green space area including any physiographic characteristics, buffers and amenities. The master development plan shall also provide the amount of land in 100-year floodplain, rights-of-way, detention or retention ponds, nonresidential lands, public lands, net usable acres and amount of green space. Furthermore, the master development plan shall state the proposed density; quality construction standards to be met and the corresponding density bonuses to be applied, if any; percentage of impervious surfaces; and any other information required by the city. 
                  "Net usable acre (nua)" means an acre of land on which dwellings may be built but exclusive of streets; rights-of-way; 100-year floodplains or flood hazard areas; detention or retention ponds; land used solely for commercial, office, institutional, or industrial uses, and public lands. Easements for drainage, sanitary sewer, etc., shall not be excluded from a net usable acre. 
                  "Pocket parks" are parks for active or passive recreational uses consisting of no less than one-quarter of a net useable acre (or 14,250 square feet). The purpose of pocket parks is to provide green space for recreational use within walking distance of most residences especially those located farthest from amenity areas or access to green space. Therefore, pocket parks shall be scattered throughout the development but more greatly concentrated in those parts of the development which are the greatest walking distance from an amenity area or access to green space. 
                  "Private alleyway" shall mean an alley located in the rear of dwellings that provides residents with vehicular access. Private alleyways shall be maintained pursuant to the rules, regulations and policies of the city at the expense of the adjoining property owners or homeowners' association. The developer or landowner shall grant the appropriate easement so that the public may use the private alleyway. Private alleyways shall be constructed to meet the following requirements: private alleyways shall be a minimum of 20 feet in width and 18 feet thereof shall be paved with concrete or asphalt. Concrete alleyways shall be reinforced and have a minimum depth of six inches with appropriate base. Asphalt alleyways shall consist of a minimum of two inches of type "E" or "F" asphalt topping, binder, and six inches of graded aggregate base. Private alleyways, at a minimum, shall be constructed so as to provide adequate turning radii onto public streets, driveways, residential parking garages and carports for full-size, noncommercial, two-axle vehicles. Curbs and gutters should be provided, but are not required. Private alleyways shall not have dead-ends. 
                  "Residential parking garage" shall mean an enclosed structure attached to or part of the principal dwelling used for housing at least two vehicles and has the following minimum dimensions: vehicular entrance height, eight feet; interior height, ten feet; vehicular entrance width, 16 feet; and overall garage width and depth, 24 feet. The floor shall be constructed of concrete. Concrete floors shall be reinforced, where appropriate, and a minimum of four inches in thickness with appropriate fill and base. Residential parking garages shall not be enclosed for living space, storage purposes or any other purpose without first obtaining a variance from the city and constructing an attached residential parking garage to the main residential structure. The residential parking garage shall be kept clear so that a minimum of one vehicle may be parked in the garage at all times. 
                  "Standard subdivision" means the form of subdivision design where all land areas within the development are divided into building lots and rights-of-way and where there is little or no green space land set aside outside of said building lots and rights-of-way for preservation in its natural or undeveloped condition. 
                  "Third party right of enforcement" means the right provided in a conservation easement to enforce any of its terms granted to a governmental body, charitable corporation, charitable association, or charitable trust, which, although eligible to be a holder, is not a holder. 
                  (b)  Purpose of the conservation residential subdivision. The purpose of Conservation Residential Subdivision district is to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the present and future inhabitants of the City of Hampton by allowing flexibility in the design of certain subdivisions from standard regulations to support permanent protection of green space. 
                  The specific purposes of a Conservation Residential Subdivision district include: 
                  (1)  To provide single-family residential subdivisions which permit flexibility of design in order to preserve environmentally sensitive areas and create efficient uses of the land. 
                  (2)  To preserve green space and unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands, wildlife habitats, historic features and unique topography. 
                  (3)  To permit clustering of dwellings and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount or infrastructure, including paved surfaces, utilities, earthwork and other land disturbing activities. 
                  (4)  To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential developments. 
                  (5)  To conserve a portion of the otherwise developable property as green space in perpetuity. This option is not necessarily intended to allow an applicant to conserve only the portion of the tract that is already unbuildable due to factors such as steep slopes, wetlands, or land adjacent to undesirable areas such as landfills or livestock farming. 
                  (6)  To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the City of Hampton. 
                  (7)  To promote linking of greenways and corridors between the City of Hampton and neighboring jurisdictions. 
                  (8)  To encourage interactions of persons living in the resulting residential community by clustering dwellings and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood. 
                  (9)  To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries. 
                  (10)  To incorporate aesthetic design standards that will increase the value of the neighborhood. 
                  (11)  To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by promoting views of green space from arterial and collector roads. 
                  (12)  To preserve important historical and archaeological sites. 
                  (13)  To promote other purposes of the Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Regulations, Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Ordinance and other ordinances and policies of the City of Hampton. 
                  (c)  Permitted locations. 
                  (1)  A conservation residential subdivision ("CRS"), as defined herein, is permitted as a conditional use in RA, R-1, R-2 and R-3 districts. An application for a CRS as a conditional use shall include all information required for a zoning amendment and shall be presented to the city council for final approval. 
                  (2)  A CRS shall have an entrance and exit which opens onto an arterial road. A CRS, however, may be permitted where the entrance and exit opens onto a collector street, provided a traffic study has been completed by the city or its designee, the developer has reimbursed the city for the cost of said study, and the developer agrees to make those road improvements determined necessary by the city council after review of said traffic study. Transfers of property in order to avoid or minimize the scope of this requirement shall not alleviate developer's or owner's responsibility hereunder. 
                  (3)  For all CRSs, the homes shall be serviced by public water and public sewer. 
                  (d)  Dimensional requirements for conservation residential subdivisions. The development standards for conservation residential subdivisions shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  The minimum property size shall be ten acres. Although no maximum acreage amount is established, the city council reserves the right to restrict the number of acres that may be dedicated for CRS use on a case-by-case basis. 
                  (2)  The minimum lot size shall be 6,600 square feet. 
                  (3)  Where the lot has rear vehicular access via a private alleyway, the minimum front setback shall be 20 feet from the public right-of-way. Where the lot has front vehicular access via an internal street, the minimum front setback shall be 30 feet from the public right-of-way line. 
                  (4)  The minimum side yard shall be five feet from the side property line but no less than 15 feet between dwellings. 
                  (5)  Where the lot has rear vehicular access via a private alleyway, the minimum rear setback shall be 30 feet from the rear property line. Where the lot has front vehicular access via an internal street, the minimum rear setback shall be 20 feet from the rear property line. 
                  (6)  The minimum lot width shall be 55 feet. 
                  (7)  The maximum height shall be 40 feet. 
                  (e)  Density restrictions. The net density, except where bonuses are used, shall not exceed the following limits depending on the zoning of the property: 
                  (1)  RA district: Maximum of 0.5 dwelling units per net usable acre without density bonuses. Maximum of 1.5 dwelling units per net usable acre with density bonuses. 
                  (2)  R-1 district: Maximum of 0.8 dwelling units per net usable acre without density bonuses. Maximum of 1.8 dwelling units per net usable acre with density bonuses. 
                  (3)  R-2 district: Maximum of 2.0 dwelling units per net usable acre without density bonuses. Maximum of 3.0 dwelling units per net usable acre with density bonuses. 
                  (4)  R-3 district: Maximum of 2.6 dwelling units per net usable acre without density bonuses. Maximum of 3.6 dwelling units per net usable acre with density bonuses. 
                  If the tract on which a CRS is to be developed consists of different single-family residential districts, then the net density for the entire tract shall not exceed that which would have been allowed had each district been separately developed as a CRS. An applicant for a CRS conditional use permit for such a tract shall provide in its application a survey plat, signed and sealed by a registered surveyor in the State of Georgia, indicating the location and net usable acreage of each district for purposes of calculating the overall net density for the tract. The applicant shall provide the net density calculations for each such tract in the master development plan, but may, at the city council's discretion, subdivide the entire property based on an average of the permissible densities for each such tract. 
                  (f)  Development standards. Applications for conservation residential subdivisions as a conditional use shall be processed in the same manner as an application for a zoning map amendment, including subject to final approval by the city council. A conditional use application for a CRS that is not compliant with this Ordinance shall not be accepted and, if accepted, shall nevertheless be invalid. CRS plats shall be processed in the same manner as a standard subdivision plat. An approved final plat shall have an additional marking of CRS, symbolizing the use of conservation residential subdivision development standards. Conditional use permits and final plats for conservation residential subdivisions may be approved by the council, provided that the following minimum development standards are met or exceeded: 
                  (1)  Forty percent of the net usable acres shall be permanently protected as described elsewhere in this section. 
                  (2)  No lands with utility easements shall be used toward meeting the 40 percent green space requirement. In the event a particular easement, or use, is not contemplated by this section then the planning and zoning director, after consultation with the city manager, shall determine if it meets the standard for inclusion in the acreage used for meeting the green space requirement. 
                  (3)  A 100-foot undisturbed buffer shall be maintained along all exterior streets and a 50-foot undisturbed buffer along the perimeter of the property to which the CRS conditional use will apply in accordance with the following requirements: 
                  a.  If the property is wooded and the timber has not been cut in the past five years, the above-required buffers shall remain undisturbed. 
                  b.  If timber on the property has been cut within the last five years or if the property is partially wooded and partially open or entirely open, the above-required buffers in the wooded area shall be undisturbed and buffers in open or timbered areas shall be enhanced with a planted vegetative buffer. Said vegetative buffer shall consist of a minimum of four rows of trees planted with 20-foot separation between trees and staggered so as to provide vegetative screen. Three-quarters of the trees must be overstory trees with the remainder consisting of understory trees as defined, listed, and of a minimum size as prescribed in the city landscaping ordinance. Existing trees in the buffer area shall be incorporated into the planted vegetative buffer. 
                  These required buffers are in addition to and shall not be included in the lot setback required for a CRS. 
                  (4)  Along both sides of perennial and intermittent streams or rivers a 100-foot and a 50-foot undisturbed buffer, respectively, shall be maintained. Also, a 100-foot undisturbed buffer shall be maintained around all wetlands, ponds and lakes; but access easements of no wider than 15 feet may be cleared. The number and location of such easements shall be determined by the city manager. 
                  (5)  All dedications, easements, or other specific measures required to be done to meet the regulations of this section shall be completed prior to the issuance of a building permit on any lot of the subdivision. 
                  (6)  No less than 30 percent of the dwellings shall consist of all sides brick, except for soffits. No less than 20 percent of the dwellings shall consist of all sides brick, stone, stucco, or any combination thereof, except soffits. No vinyl siding shall be permitted except for soffits. 
                  (7)  Streets must be at least 22 feet in width as measured pursuant to the subdivision ordinance. Curbs and gutters are required. 
                  (8)  Paved driveways are required. 
                  (9)  Sidewalks are required, on both sides of all streets within any development developed under the standards of this district. Sidewalks must be made of concrete a minimum of four inches in depth and four feet in width and located at least three feet from the backside of the curb so as to provide a buffer between the street and sidewalk. A multi-use path, as described in subsection (f)(15), may be substituted for a sidewalk. 
                  (10)  Decorative streetlights are required. 
                  (11)  Underground utilities are required. 
                  (12)  The minimum dwelling size shall be 1,700 square feet of heated floor space for single story dwellings. For multi-story dwellings the minimum dwelling size shall be 2,200 square feet of heated floor space. 
                  (13)  Alleyways and alternative parking. 
                  a.  Private alleyways are required except along the perimeter of the property. Private alleyways shall be located adjacent to, but not in, the rear setback of the lot. Where private alleyways are not provided along the perimeter of the property, the internal street in front of such lots shall have at least an additional ten feet of paved surface for parallel parking in front of said lots for a total minimum street width within the public right-of-way of at least 32 feet as measured in accordance with the subdivision ordinance. Said additional paved surface shall meet same construction requirements as set for residential streets under the subdivision ordinance. Parallel parking spaces shall be demarcated every 20 feet. Approximately every 12 spaces shall be broken by landscaping, and said landscaping shall be located in between dwellings rather than directly in front of a dwelling to the greatest extent practicable. Said landscaping area shall be no less than ten feet wide and 20 feet long. 
                  b.  As an alternative to required private alleyways, a developer may request one of the three following alternatives. Such request shall be in writing and shall specify the reasons justifying the request. The request shall be made prior to preliminary plat approval and shall be subject to city council approval, denial, or approval with conditions: 
                  1.  Parallel parking. City council may allow parallel parking throughout the CRS in lieu of private alleyways. If so approved, all internal streets shall have, in addition to the minimum required width for streets in the subdivision, ten feet of paved surface on both sides of the street for parallel parking, except where all lots on that side of the street have rear access via a private alleyway. Construction and landscaping of said parallel parking areas shall meet the minimum requirements set forth in subsection (f)(13)a., above. 
                  2.  Designated parking areas. City council may allow designated parking areas throughout the CRS in lieu of private alleyways. The minimum number of lots required in designated parking areas shall be at least one parking space for every two dwellings in the CRS. Said parking areas shall be dispersed throughout the CRS and within a reasonable walking distance from the dwellings they are to serve. 
                  3.  Combination of alleyways, parallel parking and/or designated parking areas. The city council may allow a combination of private alleyways, parallel parking and/or designated parking areas. 
                  Alternative parking plans are subject to the review and approval of city council as part of final plat approval. 
                  (14)  Residential parking garages are required; however, the maximum coverage of the front facade of any dwelling unit by the garage may be no greater than 40 percent; for those residences adjacent to private alleyways, the residential parking garage shall be located in the rear of the main structure with the garage opening facing the alleyway and with a driveway providing access from the private alleyway to the garage. 
                  (15)  Multi-use paths. 
                  a.  Multi-use paths are required. Such paths shall be constructed to connect each residential lot to the largest portion of green space and required amenities located in the subdivision and those commercial, office, and industrial areas inside and outside the subdivision as required in subsection (f)(15)b., below. Multi-use paths may not be constructed in lieu of streets or alleyways; however, private alleyways may be counted towards the multi-use path requirement where at least a ten-foot wide easement is granted for public use and the private alleyway is demarcated according to this paragraph. Multi-use paths shall be a minimum of four inches in depth, ten feet in width with demarcations, either by different shaded surfaces or a solid or dashed line, to designate that at least four feet of the width of the path is for pedestrian use and the remaining portion of the width of the path may be used for bicycles and golf carts. Multi-use paths shall be constructed of concrete, asphalt, some pervious material approved by the city or a combination thereof. If pervious material is used, it shall not be a loose material (e.g., wood chips, gravel, sand or dirt) and it shall have a life span comparable to or better than that of asphalt. 
                  b.  In addition, the landowner or developer shall extend the multi-use path from the subdivision to the nearest commercial area. Upon application by the owner or developer, however, the city reserves the right to reduce, eliminate, or modify this requirement if: (i) the landowner or developer tenders to the city or its designee funds, equal to the amount which would be expended by the developer to design and construct the multi-use path extension required under this subsection; (ii) the city or its designee confirm that the funds deposited will be used for design and construction of a multi-use path benefiting the public at large, consistent with applicable law; (iii) the city or its designee votes to accept such funds and exercise the right to reduce, eliminate, or modify the multi-use path requirement in this subsection in a manner and to a degree acceptable to the landowner or developer; (iv) the city or its designee places such funds in escrow to be used solely for the purposes outlined in this section; and (v) all documents necessary to satisfy this section are executed, subject to approval by the city attorney as to form. In determining whether to reduce, eliminate, or modify the multi-use path requirement under this subsection, the city or its designee shall consider whether doing so will promote public health, safety and welfare by enabling the public at large to receive a higher quality multi-use path in a more cost-efficient manner. 
                  (16)  Impervious cover requirements. The master development plan shall demonstrate that the development will comply with all impervious cover requirements set forth in the City of Hampton Zoning Ordinance, Watershed District Ordinances, Wetland Ordinance, Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance, and Stormwater Runoff Ordinance, as applicable. Compliance with the impervious requirements shall be certified by a licensed surveyor, engineer, landscape architect, or any other professional authorized to render similar services under state law. 
                  (17)  The subdivision must be serviced by adequate water pressure and sewer capacity. Septic systems are not permitted. 
                  (18)  Amenities. 
                  a.  The following are required amenities: (i) one multi-use field large enough to contain a regulation football and soccer field including soccer goals; (ii) one regulation size basketball court with two backboards, hoops, nets and outdoor lighting; and (iii) two fenced regulation size tennis court with nets and outdoor lighting. Each required amenity shall also have two permanent outdoor benches and two permanent outdoor trash receptacles. 
                  b.  For each additional amenity listed below and provided in the subdivision, the required green space may be reduced by 1.5 percent, with a maximum total reduction of 4.5 percent. 
                  •  Tennis courts - one lighted and fenced facility featuring a minimum of two playing courts. 
                  •  Walking trails - at least 2,000 linear feet, three feet in width. This amenity may be counted only once (i.e., even if the walking trail exceeds 2,000 linear feet, the maximum green space reduction may be only 1.5 percent). 
                  •  A baseball field - (reg.) regulation size. 
                  •  A baseball field - (LL) little league size. 
                  •  A softball field - regulation size (adult). 
                  •  A soccer field - regulation size. 
                  •  A multi-use field - football and soccer. 
                  •  A multi-use field - football and baseball. 
                  •  A football field - regulation size. 
                  •  A lake with a railed dock and accessed by trails. 
                  •  A regulation-size basketball court with two backboards, hoops, and nets. 
                  •  Other amenity approved by the city council as comparable to those listed here.

                  (Ord. No. 170, §§ 15, 16, 9-10-02) 
                  Sec. 67-163. - Wetland protection standards. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. 
                  (1)  The wetlands within the City of Hampton, Georgia, are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia. 
                  (2)  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  (3)  It is, therefore, necessary for Hampton, Georgia, to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The purpose of this Ordinance is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this Ordinance is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat. 
                  (c)  Wetland Protection district. This Ordinance shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the jurisdiction of Hampton, Georgia. The U.S. Department of the Interior, National Wetland Inventory Maps (NWI Maps), adopted as part of this Ordinance, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The NWI maps, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Ordinance. The NWI maps shall be on file in the office of the City of Hampton Planning and Zoning Department. 
                  (d)  Wetland Protection district boundaries. The NWI maps are general reference documents, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the NWI maps is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The NWI maps do not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of Henry County and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this Ordinance does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (e)  Buffer requirements. A natural or enhanced vegetative buffer shall be maintained for a distance of 25 feet along the wetland as measured from the delineated boundary to provide an area of protection between the wetland and all permissible uses. 
                  (f)  Relationship to zoning. The Wetland Protection district is hereby established. The Wetland Protection district shall comprise an overlay zone that supplements and is indicated on the Official Zoning Map of Hampton, Georgia. 
                  (g)  Issuance of permits. No local permit should be issued on a project that appears to contain wetlands until a determination has been made by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on whether jurisdictional wetlands exist on the site. If there are jurisdictional wetlands on the site that will be disturbed by the proposed development, the applicant must first obtain a wetlands alteration section 404 permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  (1)  To find out whether your proposed activity requires a section 404 permit, or to request a jurisdictional determination from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, mail inquiries to: 
                  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  Regulatory Branch  P.O. Box 889  Savannah, GA 31402-0889  1-800-448-2402 
                  (h)  Permissible uses (uses as of right). The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein. 
                  (1)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
                  (2)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
                  (3)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (4)  The continuation cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. 
                  (5)  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
                  (6)  Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
                  (7)  Temporary emergency permit. A temporary emergency permit can be issued by the City of Hampton, Georgia for the following reasons: 
                  a.  Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to Hampton, and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
                  b.  Temporary water level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations. 
                  c.  Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided that the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of subsection (h)(4) above. 
                  d.  Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided that they are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland. 
                  e.  Temporary permits. 
                  f.  National Army Corps permits. 
                  (i)  Unacceptable uses. 
                  (1)  Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants. 
                  (2)  Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills. 
                  (3)  Other uses not approved by Hampton, Georgia. 
                  (Ord. No. 170, §§ 15, 16, 9-10-02) 
                  Sec. 67-164. - Groundwater recharge protection standards. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. To provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within Hampton, Georgia and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that Hampton, Georgia, and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable, rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The purpose of this Ordinance is to: 
                  (1)  Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
                  (2)  Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and 
                  (3)  Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality. 
                  (c)  Establishment of a groundwater recharge area district. A groundwater recharge area district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of Hampton, Georgia, that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. 
                  (d)  Determination of pollution susceptibility. Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. 
                  (e)  Definitions. The following words and phrases shall have the meaning given in this section: 
                  Aquifer: Any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. (Note: This is the same definition used in the Federal Groundwater Use Act.) 
                  DRASTIC: The standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental protection Agency (US EPA) document EPA-600/2-87-035. (Note: The DRASTIC methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility). 
                  Pollution susceptibility: The relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. 
                  Pollution susceptibility maps: Maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas having high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
                  Recharge area: Any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
                  Significant recharge areas: Those areas mapped by the department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contracts, geologic structure, the presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces. 
                  (f)  Use limitations. The following criteria pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-18 shall apply in significant recharge areas: 
                  (1)  New above ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks having a minimum volume of 670 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. (Note: These figures are consistent with US EPA rules for oil pollution prevention, 40 CFR 112.1.) Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
                  (2)  New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within: 
                  a.  A high pollution susceptibility area; 
                  b.  A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15 acre-feet; 
                  c.  A low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet. 
                  (3)  New wastewater treatment basins shall have an impermeable liner approved by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. 
                  (4)  No new stormwater infiltration basins may be constructed. 
                  (5)  Wastewater spray irrigation systems or the land spreading of wastewater sludge shall be practiced in accordance with department of natural resources criteria for slow rate land treatment. An application for a development permit for activities involving wastewater spray irrigation or land spreading of wastewater sludge must be accompanied by proof that the applicant has received a land application system permit from the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. 
                  (6)  New homes served by septic tank/drain field systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified on Table MT-1 of the Department of Human Resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereinafter "DHR Table MT-1"): 
                  a.  One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
                  b.  One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; 
                  c.  One hundred ten percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
                  (7)  New mobile home parks served by septic tank/drain field systems shall have lots or spaces having the following size limitation as identified on Table MT-2 of the Department of Human Resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereinafter "DHR Table MT-2"): 
                  a.  One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
                  b.  One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; 
                  c.  One hundred ten percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
                  (8)  If the Hampton Zoning Ordinances require a larger lot size than that required by subsection (f)(6) above for homes or by subsection (f)(7) above for mobile homes, the larger lot size shall be used. 
                  (9)  Any lot of record, as of the effective date of this section shall be exempt from the requirements of subsection (f)(6) or (7) lot size standards. 
                  (10)  No construction may proceed on a building or mobile home to be served by a septic tank unless the Henry County Health Department first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the DHR Manual and subsections (f)(6), (7), (8) and (9) above. 
                  (11)  The Atlanta Regional Commission is responsible for considering, in the regional plan, the cumulative environmental effects of a significant number of septic tank systems being used in close proximity to each other. In so considering the Atlanta Regional Commission shall not approve any local plans that would result in adverse environmental effects on another area. The Atlanta Regional Commission may consult with the department of human resources and department of natural resources for technical assistance as to appropriate densities of lots served by septic tanks in significant recharge areas. 
                  (12)  New facilities which handle hazardous materials, of types and in amounts determined by department of natural resources, shall perform their operations on impermeable surfaces having spill and leak collection systems, as prescribed by department of natural resources. 
                  (Ord. No. 170, §§ 15, 16, 9-10-02) 
                  Sec. 67-165. - River corridor protection standards. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. The state has determined that its river corridors are of vital importance in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source of clean drinking water. River corridors are fragile natural resources subject to flood, erosion, soil-bearing capacity limitation, and other natural and human induced hazards. In their natural state they serve multiple functions for pollution control, aquifer recharge and discharge, storage and passage of floodwater, and erosion and sedimentation control, as well as wildlife habitat, education, scientific study, open space and recreation, and scenic and aesthetic beauty. 
                  (b)  Purpose. 
                  (1)  The river corridor protection district is an overlay district that applies additional standards of specific areas that may lie within any State of Georgia designated protected river corridor. In each zoning district located within the boundaries of the river corridor protection district, both the regulations of that district and the regulations of the river corridor protection district shall apply. If required development standards are specified for the same item in both districts, the more stringent governs. 
                  (2)  The purpose of this district is to protect certain river corridors that have been designated by the State of Georgia as protected river corridors because of their unique environmental importance. This district is intended to help maintain high water quality of these rivers. Other local governments lying along these river corridors have adopted similar protective measures. In this manner, this state resource may be protected in a way that would not be possible by the uncoordinated action of an individual jurisdiction. 
                  (c)  Boundaries of the River Corridor Protection district. The River Corridor Protection district consists of a natural vegetative buffer area extending 150 feet from the top of the riverbank on both sides of the Towaliga River as established by the State of Georgia. The top of the riverbank is defined as the uppermost part of the riverbank, usually marked by a break in the slope. All land that lies within this corridor is part of the River Corridor Protection district. The River Corridor Protection district is delineated on the protected river corridors map, which is made a part of this Ordinance by reference, and is used to show the boundaries of the River Corridor Protection district. 
                  (d)  Permitted uses. 
                  (1)  Single-family dwellings, including the usual appurtenances, within the buffer area, meeting the following conditions: 
                  a.  The dwelling shall be located on a tract of land containing at least two acres. For the purposes of these standards, the size of the tract of land shall not include any area that lies within the protected river (that is, for tracts of land that include portions of a protected river, the area between the river banks can not be counted towards the two-acre minimum size). Only the part of the lot from the riverbank back from the water may be used. A lot of less than two acres existing at the time of enactment of this Ordinance is grandfathered and may be used as long as other provisions of this Ordinance are met. 
                  b.  There shall be only one such dwelling on each two-acre or larger tract of land. 
                  c.  Complies with all other applicable zoning regulations. 
                  d.  No septic tank or septic tank drainfield may be located within the protected river corridor. 
                  (2)  A structure existing at the time of adoption of this Ordinance is grandfathered and may be rebuilt provided minimum square footage and setback requirements of the primary zoning district in which the structure is located are met. 
                  (3)  Construction of road crossings and utility crossings meeting the following development standards: 
                  a.  All requirements of the Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Act of 1975 and the City of Hampton Soil and Sedimentation Control Ordinance must be met. 
                  (4)  Timber production and harvesting meeting the following development standards: 
                  a.  Activity must be consistent with the best management practices established by the Georgia Forestry Commission. 
                  b.  Activity must not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended. 
                  (5)  Any pre-existing industrial and commercial use located within the River Corridor Protection district meeting the following development standards: 
                  a.  Activity does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended. 
                  b.  Activity complies with all applicable state and federal environmental laws and regulations. 
                  (6)  Wildlife and fisheries management activities consistent with the purposes of O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 (as amended) of Article 1, Chapter 2, Title 12 of the Official Code of Georgia, Annotated. 
                  (7)  Wastewater treatment. 
                  (8)  Recreational activities consistent with either the maintenance of a natural vegetative buffer or with river-dependent recreation. For example, a boat ramp would be consistent with this criterion, but a hard surface tennis court would not. Paths and walkways within the protected river corridor are consistent with this criterion, but parking lots are not. 
                  (9)  Natural water quality treatment or purification. 
                  (10)  Agricultural production and management meeting the following development standards: 
                  a.  Activity complies with best management practices established by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission. 
                  b.  Activity does not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended. 
                  c.  Activity shall be consistent with all state and federal laws and all regulations promulgated by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. 
                  (11)  Other use permitted in a primary zoning district that ties in the River Corridor Protection district. The list of permitted uses given for each primary zoning district must be adhered to on land to which the River Corridor Protection district is also applied. However the list of prohibited uses given in the paragraph below of this section applies to all River Corridor Protection district land, regardless in which primary zoning district it lies. 
                  (12)  Other uses permitted by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources or under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (e)  Prohibited uses. The following uses are specifically prohibited within the River Corridor Protection district: 
                  (1)  Neither septic tanks, nor septic tank drainfields. 
                  (2)  Handling areas for receiving and storage of hazardous waste, unless located within port facilities that meet the following development standards: 
                  a.  All federal and state laws and regulations for the handling and transport of hazardous waste are met. 
                  b.  Operations are performed on impermeable surfaces having spill and leak protection systems as described by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. 
                  (3)  Hazardous waste landfill. 
                  (4)  Solid waste landfill. 
                  (5)  Except as noted above, all construction within the buffer area. 
                  (f)  Buffer restoration. The natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land-disturbing activity or construction within the river corridor related to the acceptable uses above.

                  Sec. 67-167. - Comprehensive tree ordinance. 
                  (a)  Introduction. 
                  (1)  Purpose and intent: The purpose of this Ordinance is to provide for the protection, conservation and replacement of trees and landscaping in order to improve the urbanized and natural environment of Henry County. It is the policy of Henry County to minimize the removal of trees on development sites and, upon proper site completion, achieve replacement of trees by uniform standards set forth in this Ordinance. 
                  (2)  Jurisdiction: The City of Hampton, Georgia. 
                  (3)  Findings: Growth and development exist and will continue in the City of Hampton and, as a result, there is and will continue to be a loss of trees throughout the city. Tree roots hold soil in place and tree photosynthesis converts carbon dioxide to oxygen. Trees also provide habitat for wildlife that is essential for their survival. Tree loss contributes to dramatic increases in soil erosion and sedimentation. High growth areas where natural green spaces are diminishing have left fewer trees to transform carbon dioxide into oxygen. 
                  The City Council of Hampton finds that: 
                  a.  Integrated forest canopies reduce the costs of maintenance of other parts of the urban infrastructure. 
                  b.  Well managed forest resources increase in value and provide benefits to all the citizens with respect to air quality, water quality, stormwater management, temperature amelioration and general quality of life. 
                  c.  These benefits are crucial to the long-term health, safety and welfare of our citizens. 
                  d.  The removal of forest canopy and replacement with more intensive land uses exacts real costs upon the infrastructure which must be borne by all citizens of the city. 
                  (4)  Definitions: All words in these standards have their customary dictionary definition except as specifically defined herein. The words "will," "shall" and "must" are mandatory, and the words "may" and "should" are permissive. 
                  Buffer: An area of a lot or parcel established and maintained to create a naturally preserved space between dissimilar use properties. 
                  Caliper: The diameter or thickness of the trunk of a nursery-grown tree as measured at four inches above the top of the root mass. 
                  Canopy tree: A class of large trees attaining significant height in the forest or landscape. Examples include red maple, sycamore, river birch, red oak, willow oak, loblolly pine, or trees of similar stature. 
                  Critical root zone: An area on the ground around a tree that is equal to the reach of the farthest branches. It is assumed that this critical root zone includes the majority of the trees root mass, however recent research suggests that many important feeder roots extend far beyond this zone. 
                  Cutting: The detaching or separating of any limb, branch, or root from a tree. 
                  DBH—Diameter at breast height: A forestry term that takes the thickness measurement of a tree at 4½ feet above the ground. 
                  Dead tree: A tree that does not contain any live tissue, i.e., green leaves or live limbs. 
                  Deciduous tree: Any tree which naturally loses its leaves in the fall.

                  e.  The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant. 
                  f.  The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land. 
                  g.  The variance is not a request to permit a use of land which is not permitted by right in the district involved. 
                  (4)  Variance procedure: An applicant for a variance shall file a written request with the applicable Hampton Planning and Zoning Department Director or Building Department Director. The city council shall establish a reasonable time for hearing the variance request and shall give public notice thereof and due notice to the parties in interest; and shall decide the variance request within reasonable time. At the hearing any party may appear in person, or by agent or by attorney. 
                  (5)  Fees: All requests by private groups, individuals, businesses and other nonpublic organizations for appeals and variances shall be accompanied by a filing fee which is maintained in the office of the Hampton Planning and Zoning Department Director or Building Department Director, as applicable.

                  c.  If a developer or builder performs or allows, intentionally or accidentally, mass grading or tree removal, contrary to the requirements of this Ordinance, then, in addition to the penalties above, the minimum tree planting requirements of this Ordinance contained in subsection (d) shall be accomplished prior to the approval of the final development plat or certificate of occupancy, whichever is applicable. 
                  d.  In lieu of fine(s), a court with appropriate jurisdiction may require that the defendant abate or cause to be cured any other violation of this Ordinance.

                  ARTICLE X. - BUFFER AREAS 

                  Sec. 67-191. - Provision for planted buffer areas. 
                  (a)  It is recognized that the adjacent location of certain land uses may create an incompatible situation that can be mitigated by the installation of a planted buffer. An incompatible situation can arise due to the location of commercial or industrial uses adjacent to residentially-zoned land, or to a lesser extent due to location of mobile home parks or multiple-family residences adjacent to single-family residential districts. 
                  Therefore, when land is to be rezoned for a use creating an incompatible situation, or when a use deemed incompatible is modified or expanded, a planted buffer shall be provided along all side and rear property lines to insulate adjacent properties from adverse impacts. 
                  (b)  The following situations constitute creation of incompatibilities and are subject to buffer requirements of this chapter: 
                  (1)  The location of commercial or industrial land use directly adjacent to residentially-zoned land. 
                  (2)  The location of mobile home parks, duplex developments or multiple-family developments directly adjacent to land zoned for single-family residences. 
                  (c)  The city council, upon recommendation by the planning and zoning commission, or upon their own motion, may require a planted buffer of a set width between conflicting land uses or zoning districts when it is determined that an incompatible situation exists. 
                  (Ord. No. 170, §§ 18, 19, 9-10-02) 
                  Sec. 67-192. - Buffer area requirements. 
                  (a)  The required buffer shall provide necessary visual privacy for the conduct of residential lifestyles in an undisturbed environment, and shall provide for the protection and preservation of property values in residential districts. 
                  (b)  Planted buffers shall be established and maintained by the owner of the property containing the incompatible land use. The determination of incompatibility shall be based upon the existing character of the area in which the proposed action takes place. For example, proposed development or modification of commercial or industrial land use adjacent to an area developed as residential shall require the owner of the commercial or industrial property to install and maintain the planted buffer. If however, nonresidentially zoned land is rezoned for development of residences and this property is located adjacent to land developed as, or zoned for nonresidential use, the owner of the property to be rezoned for residences shall be required to install and maintain the buffer. 
                  (c)  The requirements for planted buffers are as follows: 
                  (1)  Where office/institutional, commercial or industrial land uses are contiguous with land zoned for single-family residential use, the minimum width of the required planted buffer shall be 40 feet. 
                  (2)  Where commercial or industrial land uses are contiguous with land zoned for mobile home development, duplexes, or multiple-family residences, the minimum width of the required planted buffer shall be 30 feet. 
                  (3)  Where mobile home developments, duplexes, or multiple-family land uses are contiguous with land zoned for single-family residences, the minimum width of the required planted buffer shall be 20 feet. 
                  (d)  In all other instances, the minimum width of a planted buffer shall not be less than 20 feet and no more than 75 feet. Plantings attaining a minimum height in excess of that required herein might be required to mitigate the impacts of certain projects. 
                  (e)  The required planted buffer can be incorporated into the yard setback as specified in the appropriate zoning district. In some instances the Hampton Planning and Zoning Department may require a masonry wall or decorative fence as part of the buffer requirement. This would result in a reduction of width of the required buffer.

                  Sec. 67-193. - Buffer area specifications. 
                  The following are minimum specifications for required planted buffers. Buffers shall: 
                  (1)  Be depicted in detail (the type and location of natural and planted vegetation are to be illustrated) on each site plan or plat prior to approval, and shall be designated as a permanent easement. 
                  (2)  Not to be disturbed by grading, property improvements or construction activities, except where necessary to prevent a nuisance, or to thin such natural growth, where too dense to permit normal growth, or to remove diseased, misshapen, or dangerous and decayed timbers. Any contemplated disturbance shall first be brought to the attention of the planning and zoning department [and] formal approval secured prior to initiating activity within required buffer areas. 
                  (3)  Utilize existing vegetation in an undisturbed state where it has been determined that existing vegetation is appropriate for inclusion within the buffer strip, or when required be supplemented with approved, additional plantings. 
                  (4)  Retain the natural topography of the land, except when a portion must be cleared and graded as required by the local law to prevent soil erosion or sedimentation. 
                  (5)  Be completely installed in accordance with the approved plan prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy. 
                  (6)  Not be used for temporary or permanent parking or loading, other than for provision of drainage improvements as mandated by local law, or for a structure other than fence. 
                  (7)  Attain a minimum height of six feet within three years of the planting date.

                  Sec. 67-211. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  It is the intent of this chapter that all buildings, structures and uses of land shall provide off-street parking and loading space in an amount sufficient to meet the needs caused by the building or use of land and that such parking and loading spaces be so oriented that they are in fact readily usable for such purposes. 
                  (b)  Except as provided in this article, no application for a building permit shall be approved unless there is included with the plan for such building, improvements or use, a plot plan showing the required space reserved for off-street parking and service purposes. Occupancy shall not be allowed unless the required off-street parking and service facilities have been provided in accordance with those shown on the approved plan. 
                  (c)  Each use of land and each building or structure hereafter constructed or established, and each addition to a structure shall provide off-street parking and loading according to the standards set forth herein. When an addition is made to a building containing less than the required parking or loading requirements, a conforming amount of parking or loading shall be supplied based upon the size of the addition. Off-street parking spaces shall not be reduced below the minimum required number for the use or facility to which they are assigned. 
                  (d)  Two or more neighboring uses, of the same or different types, may provide joint facilities, provided that the number of off-street parking spaces are not less than the sum of the individual requirements. 
                  (e)  No addition to an existing building shall be constructed which reduces the number of spaces, area or usability of existing parking or loading space unless such building and its addition conform with the regulations for parking and loading contained herein. 
                  (f)  Parking spaces for the handicapped shall be required. Existing uses providing off-street parking shall have 12 months from date of adoption of this chapter to comply with handicapped parking requirements. New uses providing off-street parking shall incorporate handicapped spaces into the design of parking facilities. 
                  (g)  When multiple uses occupy a building, the parking and loading requirement shall be met by determining the percentage of the total building area devoted to each type of use and then applying the appropriate requirements by use. 
                  (h)  Up to 20 percent of the total parking spaces required may be used for the parking of the compact cars, provided that all such spaces are labeled as such on the ground.

                  Sec. 67-214. - Design criteria and standards. 
                  Off-street parking and loading areas, spaces and stalls are to be designed to conform to the following criteria and standards: 
                  (1)  All multiple-family, commercial and industrial uses shall provide a paved, dust-free surface. The use of approved "porous pavement" is encouraged, provided such paving is approved for use by the city engineer. If these facilities are to be used at night, proper illumination shall be provided for the safety of pedestrians, vehicles and for security purposes. Lighting shall be designed so as not to reflect onto or cause glare in any adjacent residential district. Driveways serving single-family and duplex residences shall be paved for the entire width of the public street. 
                  (2)  Each off-street parking space shall be clearly marked, and directional arrows or signs shall be provided wherever necessary. Markers, directional arrows, and signs shall be properly maintained so as to ensure their maximum efficiency. 
                  (3)  All off-street parking, loading, and service areas shall be drained so as to prevent damage to abutting properties and/or public streets and shall be constructed of materials which will assure a surface resistant to erosion. All such areas shall be at all times maintained at the expense of the owners thereof in a clean, orderly, and dust-free condition to the extent that it does not create a nuisance. 
                  (4)  All off-street parking, loading, and service areas shall be separated from walkways, sidewalks, and public streets by curbing or other suitable protective device. 
                  (5)  The following design standards shall be used to achieve compliance with parking provisions of this chapter. These requirements are summarized in the accompanying table: 
                  a.  Each full-size automobile parking space shall not be less than 8½ feet wide and 20 feet deep. Compact car spaces shall not be less than eight feet wide and 17 feet deep. Parallel spaces for the handicapped adjacent to a walk shall be a minimum of 12 feet six inches in width by 24 feet in length. If a walk is at an elevation of the parking space a 1:6 ramp shall be provided up to the walk. For 90-degree or angled spaces the minimum width of a handicapped stall shall be nine feet. An aisle, having a width of not less than three feet six inches, shall be provided between each stall. 
                  b.  Handicapped spaces shall be marked on the pavement and by appropriate signage, both markings to use the universally accepted "Handicapped" symbol. Handicapped spaces shall be located in closest proximity to major building entrances, but in no event shall such spaces be more than 100 feet from an entrance. 
                  c.  There shall be provided adequate interior driveways to connect each parking space with a public street. Interior driveways shall be at least 24 feet wide where used with 90-degree angle parking, at least 18 feet wide where used with 60-degree angle parking, at least 12 feet wide where used with 45-degree angle parking, and at least 12 feet wide where used with parallel parking, or where there is no parking, interior driveways shall be at least 12 feet wide for one-way traffic movement and at least 24 feet wide for two-way traffic movement. 
                  (6)  The following are the design requirements for off-street loading stalls: 
                  a.  Each loading stall shall be a minimum of ten feet in width and 30 feet in length with 14 feet of overhead clearance, except that for wholesale and industrial uses loading stalls shall be a minimum of ten feet wide and 50 feet in length. 
                  b.  All off-street loading stalls shall have access from a public street. 
                  c.  All off-street loading stalls and access shall be provided with a paved, dust-free surface. If loading stalls are to be used at night, they shall be properly illuminated for the safety of pedestrians, vehicles and for security. Lighting shall be designed to preclude light spill into adjacent properties. 
                  d.  Loading stalls are not to hinder movement of pedestrians or vehicles over a public street, sidewalk or alley, or to and from an off-street parking area.

                  Sec. 67-215. - Curb cut requirements and design standards. 
                  Within any zoning district where the lowering or cutting away of any curbs for purposes of ingress and egress is required, such curb cut shall be subject to the following provisions: 
                  (1)  No more than two combined entrances and exits shall be allowed any parcel of property, the frontage of which is less than 200 feet on any one public street. Additional entrances or exits for parcels of property having a frontage in excess of 200 feet shall be permitted after showing of actual requirements of convenience and necessity and upon approval of the planning and zoning commission. Where frontage is 50 feet or less, only one combined entrance-exit shall be permitted. 
                  (2)  At public street intersections, no curb cut shall be located within 50 feet of the intersections of two curb lines or such lines extended, or within 15 feet of the intersection of two property lines extended, whichever is least restrictive. When a culvert is required it must be approved by the Henry County DOT. 
                  (3)  The distance between any two curb cuts on the same side of the public street and located on one property shall be not less than ten feet. Said distance shall be measured between the points of tangency of the curb return radii and the established curb line of the abutting public street. 
                  (4)  All driveways shall be constructed so as to be at least two feet from any property line. 
                  (5)  The maximum width of any driveway shall not exceed 40 feet measured at the right-of-way line. 
                  (6)  The maximum width of any curb cut including curb returns shall not exceed 50 feet, except that a bona fide truckstop may exceed the maximum figure as determined by the planning and zoning director. 
                  (7)  The sum of the two curb return radii for any one curb cut shall not exceed 15 feet.

The owners of the property, and any tenant on the property where buffers and landscaping are required, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping materials. Such maintenance shall include all actions necessary to keep the buffer and landscape areas free from litter and debris, to keep plantings healthy, and to keep planting areas neat in appearance. Any vegetation that constitutes part of the buffer or landscaping shall be replaced in the event it dies. 
                  (4)  Aesthetics, placement, materials and color. 
                  a.  Attached WCFs shall have both antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment that are of a neutral color identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
                  b.  WCFs with support structures shall consist of towers with a galvanized steel finish, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, in the C-3, M-1 and M-2 zoning districts. In the remaining zoning districts (RA, R-1, R-2, R-3, RM, RMH, OI, C-1, C-2), WCFs with support structures shall consist of towers with a galvanized steel finish that, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, shall be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. At a tower site, the design of the building and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. WCFs with support structures shall be of the monopole variety except when providers can document and demonstrate need for lattice-type towers. 
                  (5)  Separation requirement. In zoning districts other than General/Heavy Commercial and Industrial (C-2, C-3, M-1, M-2), WCFs over 150 feet in height shall not be located within one-quarter of a mile from any existing WCF that is over 150 feet in height. This requirement may be waived upon evidence provided to the community development director by the applicant that the nearest tower cannot support any new antenna arrays. 
                  (6)  Lighting. All WCFs shall be lighted consistent with FAA regulations for tower illumination regardless of height. Any objection by the applicant based on FAA restrictions shall be presented in writing to the community development director. 
                  (7)  Noise. No equipment shall be operated at a WCF so as to produce noise which would constitute a nuisance based on local or state laws, except in emergency situations requiring the use of a backup generator, where the noise standards may be exceeded on a temporary basis, not to exceed 14 days. No generator shall be used for regular WCF operations prior to commercial power being delivered to the site. 
                  (8)  Security fencing. WCFs with support structures shall be enclosed by a security fence of neutral color not less than six feet in height. The support structure shall also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device. 
                  (9)  Radio frequency emissions. The Federal Telecommunications Act or 1996 (FTA) gives the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) sole jurisdiction of the field of regulation of radio frequency (RF) emissions and WCFs which meet the FCC standards shall not be conditioned or denied on the basis of RF impacts. 
                  (10)  Federal requirements. All WCFs must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the WCFs governed by this article shall bring such antenna arrays and/or support structures into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective dates of such standards and regulations. Failure to bring WCFs into compliance with such revised standards and regulation shall constitute grounds for the removal of the WCF at the owner's expense by utilizing the bond required in section 67-228.7. 
                  (11)  Structural integrity. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the Electronic Industries Association/Telecommunications Industries (EIA/TIA) 222 Revision F Standard entitled Structural Standards for Steel Antenna Towers and Antenna Supporting Structures (or equivalent), as amended from time to time. A letter stamped by a engineer certified in the State of Georgia shall be required stating that the WCF and support structure meets or exceeds all applicable requirements set forth herein. If, upon inspection, the governing authority concludes a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the tower's owner, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days, the governing authority may remove such tower at the owner's expense by utilizing the bond required in section 67-228.7 of this article.

Each applicant for an antenna or tower shall provide to the planning and zoning department director an inventory of its existing towers that are either within the city limits or within one-quarter mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower. The planning and zoning department director may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or conditional use permits under this article or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the city limits; provided, however, the planning and zoning department director is not, by sharing this information, in any way representing or warranting such sites are available or suitable. 
                  c.  Collocation. Pursuant to goals in section 67-228.1, each applicant shall provide a statement indicating intent to allow shared use of the tower and how others will be accommodated, if the height of the tower allows for said collocation. 
                  (3)  Reviewing bodies. Review of WCFs under this section will be conducted by the Hampton Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Council. 
                  (4)  Public notice. Notice shall be given for this review in accordance with the procedures established in section 67-314 of this chapter for notice of applications and hearings before the planning and zoning commission and the city council.

                  (6)  Factors considered in granting conditional use permits. The planning and zoning commission and the city council shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a conditional use permit, although either body may waive, reduce, or, in certain instances, increase the burden on the applicant on one or more of these criteria if either body concludes that the goals of its ordinance are better served thereby: 
                  a.  Height of the proposed tower; 
                  b.  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
                  c.  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  d.  Surrounding topography; 
                  e.  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
                  f.  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
                  g.  Ability of the support structure and/or site for collocation with future wireless communications providers; 
                  h.  Proposed ingress and egress; and 
                  i.  Availability of suitable existing towers or other structure, as listed below in subsection (d)(7). 
                  (7)  Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. No conditional use permit for a new tower shall be granted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the planning and zoning commission and the city council that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following: 
                  a.  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  b.  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  c.  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
                  d.  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
                  e.  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
                  f.  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
                  g.  Findings (denials). All denials rendered by either the planning and zoning commission or the city council under a conditional use permit shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions of law based upon evidence in the record. 
                  h.  Timing of decision. The planning and zoning commission and/or the city council shall render its decision within 90 days of application, unless either the commission or the council can demonstrate that more time is reasonably required due to extenuating circumstances.

                  (a)  Notification. Each wireless communications provider shall notify the planning and zoning department director of their operational and non-operational WCFs at the end of the calendar year (December 31st). The director shall maintain and update a list of these facilities for geographical information systems (GIS) purposes, and for use in collocation/site-sharing, and for taking necessary actions for the removal of abandoned facilities as established below. 
                  (b)  Removal of abandoned facilities. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 90 days shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 30 days of receipt of notice from the city council of such abandonment. If there are two or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower. 
                  (c)  Bond required. The communications service provider, or the tower facility provider, shall provide a bond in the form of a letter of credit drawn on a Georgia bank with an amount of $20,000.00 to the planning and zoning department director for the removal of such structure for the lesser of the length of the lease (if applicable), including extensions, or, 20 years. Said bond shall be presented at the time of application for a building permit and shall be renewable at periods not to exceed five years.

                  ARTICLE XII. - SIGN REGULATIONS 

                  Sec. 67-231. - Purposes. 
                  The purposes of this Ordinance are set out in the preamble hereto and as follows herein: 
                  (1)  A comprehensive regulation is necessary because of the current burgeoning growth in Hampton and Henry County in general and because two major highways run through the city and attract signs that are unrelated to business uses inside the city, leading to poor aesthetics and dropping property values. 
                  (2)  To prevent the further deterioration of the city and to ensure that it remains an attractive residential area as well as a viable commercial area, it is necessary to maintain a visually satisfying environment. A plethora of signs of a certain size and nature, no matter how tasteful, can have an undesirable effect upon traffic safety and the well-being of the entire community. The city is more likely to attract commercial enterprises and permanent residents if it improves and maintains the city's appearance. City residents will ultimately benefit from enhanced retail and commercial environments and improvements in the quality of life as a result of these regulations. It is a rational desire of the community, and most specifically of those who live therein from day to day, to plan their physical surroundings in such a way that unsightliness is minimized. 
                  (3)  Further, the city has an obligation and a right to protect the rights of adjoining landowners to adequate light and air, to promote desirable living conditions and sustain stability of neighborhoods, to protect property against blight and deprivation, and to encourage the most appropriate use of land, buildings and other structures throughout the city. 
                  (4)  Accordingly, in consideration of the city's rights and obligations to promote traffic safety, to preserve property values, to provide for the convenience and enjoyment of public travel, to eliminate annoyance to travelers, to attract tourists, residents and industry, to serve the public health, safety and morals, to advance the general prosperity of the community, and to serve the general welfare, the city council hereby imposes the regulations contained in this article. 
                  (5)  The city council finds that signs provide an important medium through which individuals and entities may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as well as a traffic hazard. Such signs may also constitute an aesthetic nuisance and be a detriment to property values and the city's public welfare. The city council intends by enacting this Ordinance to: 
                  a.  Balance the rights of individuals and entities to convey their message through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
                  b.  Protect the public health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics of the city; 
                  c.  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; 
                  d.  Maintain the historical image of the city; 
                  e.  Protect property values by minimizing the potentially adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
                  f.  Promote economic development; and 
                  g.  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.

                  a.  All signs and structures within the business development are in conformance with this article; and 
                  b.  The variance, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to other property owners or tenants, or to the public good, nor would it impair the purpose and intent of this article; and 
                  c.  The city council shall consider at least one of the following factors: 
                  1.  The size of buildings constructed on the subject lot;

                  Furthermore, peculiar conditions or circumstances which are the result of actions of the current or former owner(s) of the property covered by the application cannot be considered as grounds to justify a variance. The authority to erect and maintain additional signs as may be permitted under any such variance shall terminate upon the subdivision of the lot upon which such variance was granted.

                  3.  The number of different tenants occupying the buildings; and 
                  d.  Financial loss to the applicant. However, such loss is not sufficient grounds, by itself, to justify a variance. 
                  Furthermore, peculiar conditions or circumstances which are the result of actions of the current or former owner(s) of the property covered by the application cannot be considered as grounds to justify a variance. The authority to erect and maintain additional signs as may be permitted under any such variance shall terminate upon the subdivision of the lot upon which such variance was granted. 
                  (3)  Upon application by the property owner of a lot with property described in section 67-244, the city council may grant a height variance where the applicant has shown that: 
                  a.  All signs and structures within the business development are in conformance with this article; and 
                  b.  The variance, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to other property owners or tenants, or to the public good, nor would it impair the purpose and intent of this article; and

                  Furthermore, peculiar conditions or circumstances which are the result of actions of the current or former owner(s) of the property covered by the application cannot be considered as grounds to justify a variance. The authority to erect and maintain additional signs as may be permitted under any such variance shall terminate upon the subdivision of the lot upon which such variance was granted. 
                  (e)  Downtown Sign district.

                  The city council is authorized upon appeal in specific cases to consider such variances from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the chapter will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.

                  (1)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same district. 
                  (2)  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties of the district in which the property is located.

                  (5)  The special circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant. 
                  (6)  The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure. 
                  (7)  The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, buildings or structures which is not permitted by right in the district involved.

                  An applicant requesting a variance may submit an application for a hearing before the city planning and zoning commission and council if his/her request meets all of the following conditions: 
                  (1)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same zoning district. 
                  (2)  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties within the city or within a similar zoning or overlay district. 
                  (3)  Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties within the city or within a similar zoning or overlay district. 
                  (4)  The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this chapter, the specific zoning of the property and the land use plan and will not be injurious to the general welfare of the community. 
                  (5)  The special circumstances or justifications for the variance are not the result of self-imposed actions or misfortunes of the applicant. 
                  (6)  The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, building or structure which is not permitted by right in the overlaying zoning district or scheme of the land use plan. 
                  (7)  The variance requested is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure.

                  Sec. 69-74. - Construction requirements for residential subdivisions streets. 
                  (a)  The design and construction requirements for residential subdivisions shall comply with the minimum standards shown in Table 3-1. 
                  (b)  The grading, base and pavement for residential street construction shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  Grading. All streets shall be graded to the elevations shown on the approved construction plans. 
                  (c)  Clearing and grubbing. After the development permit has been issued by the Hampton Planning and Zoning Department, and a pre-construction conference has been held, the development inspector duly notified, and all required silt and erosion control measures installed and approved, the contractor may only clear and grub those lots that have received approval for construction of homes or buildings. All trees, stumps, logs, roots, grass, weeds, poles, and other objectionable matter shall be cleared and grubbed in the areas where utilities, principle buildings, and necessary infrastructure have been permitted to go. All other vegetation, especially trees, shall be maintained on the lot or lots throughout the extent of the development. Removal of required vegetation to meet the city tree ordinance and/or landscape plan shall prohibit continuance of any field or construction work on the site. Replacement of vegetation at an equal portion to that removed or damaged shall occur prior to continuation of the project, or within the construction limits of the project. No rubbish or other material resulting from the clearing and grubbing of the public street way may be buried within a lot or future lot of record. If burning is permitted, all burn pits must be located outside of the public streetway construction limits. 
                  (d)  Excavation. All grading operations shall be planned and executed by the contractor in such a manner as to provide suitable subgrade material in the top 12 inches of the public streetway. In areas where the material in place is not suitable for subgrades, these areas shall be undercut a minimum of 12 inches and back-filled with suitable material. All rock and boulders in the public streetbed shall be excavated to a depth of at least 12 inches below the subgrade and the space back-filled to the correct grade with suitable material. Any stones, broken rock, or boulders resulting from the grading of the public streetway may not be placed in any public streetway fill area except when approved by a development inspector and then under his supervision. During the construction of the public streetway on a day to day basis, the public streetbed edges shall be kept lower than the center and the grading shall be done so that the surfaces of the excavated areas and fill will be kept reasonably smooth and well drained. Adequate surface ditches shall be cut at the tops of cut slopes, extending to each end of the cuts in order to carry the water from the side hill. Side ditchers or gutters emptying from cuts to fill areas shall be turned outward so as to prevent erosion of the fill slopes. 
                  (e)  Placement of fill. Fill construction shall not begin until all clearing and grubbing of the fill area has been completed. All depressions in the ground shall be filled level with the adjacent surface using suitable material and compacted to the approximate density to the surrounding soil before placement of the fill is begun. The entire area upon which fill is to be placed shall be plowed, scarified, and finely broken up to a depth of a minimum of six inches. Before the placement of fill material is begun, all loosened soil shall be compacted the approximate density of the underlying soil. Where a depth of fill and surfacing is three feet or less, the original ground shall be compacted a minimum 12 inches deep to at least 95 percent of the maximum laboratory dry density as determined from representative samples of the material being compacted. In areas where layers of organic or other unstable materials exists, the existing ground shall be excavated, for the full width of the fill area, to the underlining stable material. The subgrade thus created shall then be compacted to the approximate density of the underlying material. All fill material shall be deposited and spread in uniform horizontal layers, not more than six inches thick, for the full width of the fill area, and these layers shall be kept uniform by the use of graders, bulldozers or other approved equipment. Each layer shall be compacted within the range of optimum moisture content necessary to achieve the compaction required. Material containing too much water shall be dried to the correct moisture content. If the material is too dry, water shall be added and uniformly mixed with the soil before it is compacted. Fills shall be compacted to at least 95 percent of the maximum dry density to within the top 12 inches of the fill. The top 12 inches of the fill shall be compacted to at least 100 percent of the maximum dry density. The entire public streetbed shall be scarified and compacted with a sheep's foot or other approved rollers. While the work is in progress, contractor shall maintain the surface in a manner so that the excavation, fills, subgrade, base course, and ditches always present a smooth and even surface. 
                  (f)  The contractor shall have available on the job at all times at least one motor patrol grader with adequate power to blade and maintain the public streetbed. Suitable scarifies shall also be available for use wherever necessary. 
                  (1)  Final finishing of public streetway. After all excavation has been completed and all fills have been placed, the entire public street bed surface shall be finally shaped with a grading machine supplemented with hand work whenever required, to secure a smooth surface and uniform crow-section specified. When final shaping is finished, the public street surface shall conform accurately to the line, grade and cross section shown of plans, and no roots, sod, grass, stones, or other unsuitable material shall remain in the top 12 inches of the finished public streetbed. All ditches and drains shall be opened to effectively drain the public streetway. 
                  (2)  Placement of curb and gutter. After sanitary sewer and water lines have been installed, all storm drainage in place, and the final finishing of the public streetway has been approved by the development inspector, the installation of the concrete curb and gutter may begin, All concrete curb and gutter shall be in accordance with Hampton Construction Standards. Any curb and gutter, which does not conform to a true section, texture, line and grade shall be removed and replaced as directed by the development inspector. 
                  (3)  Subgrade. Before placing any pavement base the entire surface of the subgrade shall be plowed, harrower, and mixed to a depth of at least six inches. If a subgrade stabilization material is required it shall be incorporated into the subgrade at this time. After the material has been thoroughly mixed the subgrade shall be brought into a proper line and grade and compacted to 100 percent of maximum dry density just prior to placing the base material. The centerline profile shall conform to the established elevations with an acceptable tolerance of one-half-inch. The acceptance crown tolerance shall be one-half-inch. 
                  (4)  Base construction. The Hampton Development Inspector shall be notified 24 hours prior to the placing of any base material. After the inspector is satisfied all the equipment necessary for the proper construction of public street base is on the project and the subgrade has been brought to the proper line, grade and crown, and compacted to the required density he may authorize the placing of the base material. After the base material has been placed and compacted to the required density the inspector will check the completed base course. All areas found to be deficient shall be marked and corrected before any asphalt pavement is placed. Areas where the crown is found to exceed that which is specified or the exposed edge of the concrete gutter is less than the minimum depth required, shall be reshaped and rolled to obtain the required cross section. After the compacted material has been approved, cores shall be taken as directed by the development inspector to determine the thickness of the constructed base course. Areas found to be deficient in thickness shall be corrected as directed by the development inspector. A copy of all delivery tickets for the graded aggregate base material shall be furnished prior to placing any asphaltic concrete paving material. A shortage in the base material used shall require that the asphaltic concrete surface course thickness be increased. All work and materials shall be in accordance with the pertinent graded aggregate construction sections of the Georgia Department of Transportation "Standard Specifications.....", latest edition. 
                  In lieu of constructing the previously mentioned paving section, a soil cement base shall be a minimum of five inches in thickness of the surface course shall remain at two inches. All soil cement construction shall be in accordance with the "soil cement construction" sections of the Georgia Department of Transportation "Standard Specifications..."; latest edition. The preparation of the soil cement base shall be done under the supervision of a professional engineer registered in the State of Georgia. A letter stamped by the engineer attesting to the construction of the soil cement base shall be submitted to the Hampton Planning and Zoning Department for approval. 
                  (5)  Paving. 
                  a.  After the public street base has been accepted by the development inspector and upon his approval the contractor shall begin the construction of the asphaltic concrete pavement. All asphaltic concrete material and construction shall be in accordance with the "hot mix asphaltic concrete construction" sections of the Georgia Department of Transportation "Standard Specifications.....", latest edition. After the material has been placed and rolled to the satisfaction of the inspector, he shall check the cross section of the finished pavement. Any area found to be deficient shall be marked and a record of deficiencies made by the development inspector. 
                  b.  If, in the opinion of the development inspector, the extent of deficiencies will impair the performance of the pavement, he shall direct that an overlay of a minimum thickness of one inch be placed before the public streetway is opened to traffic. A copy of the delivery tickets for the asphaltic concrete material used shall be furnished to the development inspector at the time of completion of the work. If the delivery tickets indicate a shortage in the material used from the quantity estimated the development inspector may require a minimum one-inch overlay of the streets. 
                  c.  Upon acceptance of the surface course by the development inspector, the developer shall have core tests made as directed by county engineer to verify the thickness of the street base and asphalt pavement. If these indicate a deficiency in thickness of the street base asphalt pavement an overlay shall be required when the following deficiencies occur: 
                  1.  When the number of cores deficient in thickness within the allowable one-quarter of an inch tolerance exceeds 35 percent of the total cores taken on one street. 
                  2.  When two or more consecutive tests show a deficiency of more than one-quarter of an inch allowable tolerance. When a core shows a deficiency in excess of the allowable tolerance additional cores will be taken to delineate the area of the deficient thickness. 
                  3.  Any required overlay shall extend a minimum of 150 feet beyond the outer limits of the deficient area for the full width of the street. Smooth, neat joints shall be cut normal to the public streetway for full depth of asphalt pavement, removing the original pavement for a minimum of ten feet at each end of the overlay. The thickness of the overlay shall be determined by the depth of the deficient area and shall not be less than one inch in compacted thickness. The type of material used in the overlay shall be specified by the county. 
                  (6)  Shoulder and drainage improvements. After the paving has been inspected and approved, the pavement edges or behind the curb and gutter shall be back-filled and compacted and the ditches and back slopes properly graded, shaped, seeded and mulched. An 80-percent stand of grass must be obtained. All swales and ditches excavated below required depth shall be back filled and compacted to 95 percent of maximum dry density.

                  Sec. 69-162. - Administrative variances. 
                  The planning and zoning director may grant the following types of variances, without jeopardizing the intent and integrity of this chapter and all applicable or related ordinances to a development: 
                  (1)  The director shall have the authority to approve a ten percent variance in regards to front, side and rear setbacks. A ten percent variance on dimensions of a lot or lots may also be granted on no more than 20 percent of all the lots of a development, exclusive of any amenity area dimensions. Variances on open space or other dedicated space shall require city council approval. Variances shall be granted upon the following principles: 
                  a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same district. 
                  b.  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties within the city or within a similar zoning or overlay district. 
                  c.  Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties within the city or within a similar zoning or overlay district. 
                  d.  The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this article. The specific zoning of the property and the land use plan and will not be injurious to the general welfare of the community. 
                  e.  The special circumstances or justifications for the variance are not the result or cause of the self-imposed actions or misfortunes of the applicant. 
                  f.  The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, buildings or structures which is not permitted by right in the overlaying zoning district or scheme of the land use plan. 
                  g.  The variance requested is the minimum reasonable variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building or structure. 
                  (2)  Minor variances may be authorized by the planning and zoning director, utilities director, city manager, mayor or designated civil engineer of the city concerning the layout of streets, lots and blocks in situations where physical characteristics of the property create practical difficulty or hardship by strict compliance of the regulations of this chapter. A consultation with at least three of these individuals, the developer and appropriate inspectors shall be required as part of the review process of granting a deviation in street, lot and block standards. A written report shall be followed detailing the reasons why the variance was needed and why it was or was not granted. Such report shall be filed with the preliminary and final plat of the development. 
                  (3)  All other variance requests above and beyond those mentioned in this section shall require approval from the city council at a public hearing.

                  (1)  An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank. 
                  (2)  An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback. 
                  (3)  No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback. 
                  (b)  Variance procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this article, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the planning director finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the Planning Commission of the City of Hampton may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
                  (2)  Except as provided above, the Planning Commission of the City of Hampton shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the planning commission. The City of Hampton shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the City of Hampton. The City of Hampton shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. 
                  Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
                  a.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this article prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
                  b.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the ordinance would create an extreme hardship. 
                  Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this article, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
                  (3)  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
                  a.  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
                  b.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  c.  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
                  d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
                  e.  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
                  f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
                  g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and 
                  h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
                  (4)  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
                  a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
                  b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
                  c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; 
                  d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
                  e.  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; and 
                  f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.

                  Sec. 69-168. - Compatibility with other buffer regulations and requirements. 
                  (a)  This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. The requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence. 
                  (b)  While the requirements of this article are intended to apply to all streams in the City of Hampton, special conditions may exist that require greater protection. Nothing in this article should be construed as preventing the establishment of wider and/or more restrictive buffers and setbacks as required under any other existing or future legislation. In addition, nothing in this article should be construed as preventing the establishment of wider buffers for purposes of protecting greenspace, preserving habitat or other goals that may not be specifically mandated by legislation.

                  (a)  The City of Hampton may cause inspections of the work in the buffer or setback to be made periodically during the course thereof and shall make a final inspection following completion of the work. The permittee shall assist the city in making such inspections. The City of Hampton shall have the authority to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting the sites of any land development activities within the protection area. 
                  (b)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out official duties.

                  The authorized enforcement agency will adopt requirements identifying best management practices for any activity, operation or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, state waters or waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the city's separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.

                  ARTICLE XI. - POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT 

                  Sec. 69-201. - General provisions. 
                  (a)  Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that: 
                  (1)  Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
                  (2)  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
                  (3)  The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
                  (4)  These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
                  (5)  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution; and 
                  (6)  Therefore, the City of Hampton has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
                  (b)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

                  (1)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
                  a.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
                  b.  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and 
                  c.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the planning department are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
                  (2)  Stream channel protection. 
                  a.  Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
                  1.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
                  2.  Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; and 
                  3.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
                  b.  This requirement is waived for sites that discharge directly into larger streams, rivers, wetlands, or lakes, or to a manmade channel or conveyance system where the reduction in these flows will not have an impact on upstream or downstream streambank or channel integrity. 
                  (3)  Overbank flooding protection. 
                  a.  Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under subsection (2) of this section is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
                  b.  This requirement is waived for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
                  (4)  Extreme flooding protection. 
                  a.  Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
                  b.  This requirement may be adjusted or waived for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
                  (5)  Structural stormwater controls. 
                  a.  All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the planning department before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city and/or its designee may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
                  b.  Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
                  (6)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection (1) of this section. The applicant may, if approved by the planning department, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (7)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public rights-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more than one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements: 
                  a.  Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the Stormwater Design Manual; 
                  b.  All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the Stormwater Design Manual; and 
                  c.  Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual.

Upon completion of a project, and before a certificate of occupancy shall be granted, the applicant is responsible for certifying that the completed project is in accordance with the approved stormwater management plan. All applicants are required to submit actual "as-built" plans for any stormwater management facilities or practices after final construction is completed to the planning department. The plan must show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and practices and must be certified by a professional engineer.

                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (3) --- 
                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 99, adopted Mar. 10, 1998, amended art. I by renaming it "Speed Humps" and adding §§ 74-1—74-10. In order to maintain the uniform style of the Code, such sections were redesignated as §§ 74-51—74-60 under art. IV, at the discretion of the editor. 

                  Sec. 74-51. - Definitions. 
                  [The following terms, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them herein, except where context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
                  Local residential street means a paved road having residences on both sides that lies entirely within the city limits. A local residential street must intersect one other street; therefore, portions of longer streets may be considered as eligible for speed humps. 
                  Speed humps/speed tables. The construction of an asphaltic geometric design installed on streets to address speeding problems on streets that are classified as local residential streets. (Shown on Exhibit A attached to Ord. No. 99.) 
                  (Ord. No. 99, 3-10-98) 
                  Sec. 74-52. - Purpose. 
                  In response to an increasing number of complaints regarding speeding problems on residential streets, the city has studied available alternatives and methods employed by other communities and how effectively those communities have addressed residential speeding problems. The installation of speed humps was found to be a popular and relatively cost-effective measure in reducing average speeds. When properly designed and installed, and with strong majority community backing and support, speed humps were found to be effective at reducing speeds in neighborhoods. They are therefore found to be of public interest and benefit and are hereby authorized in the city. 
                  (Ord. No. 99, 3-10-98) 
                  Sec. 74-53. - Criteria for installation. 
                  The city will consider the installation of speed humps only on streets classified as local residential streets, unless otherwise initiated by the city as provided in section 74-57. 
                  (Ord. No. 99, 3-10-98) 
                  Sec. 74-54. - Request for study; public hearing. 
                  An authorized officer of an organized homeowners association or the majority of homeowners on a local residential street may, through an informal petition or letter, request that a street be studied for speed hump installation. The letter or petition must demonstrate that the desires of a majority of the property owners are represented. The results of the speed hump study may be directed to the petition representative by certified mail, or, upon request, will be presented by the council at an advertised public hearing with a general presentation on speed humps. All property owners affected shall be notified by an authorized representative of the petition group of the time and place of the public hearing. Property owners will be notified that the installation of speed humps may reduce emergency response time by ten seconds for each hump installed. 
                  (Ord. No. 99, 3-10-98) 
                  Sec. 74-55. - Preparation of formal petition. 
                  A formal petition in such form prescribed by the council shall be filed with the council requesting the speed humps be installed on a local residential street. All property owners on the street shall be notified by an authorized representative of the petition group and afforded an opportunity to sign the petition. Each property owner shall indicate his or her preference for the installation of the speed hump(s) by marking a "YES" or "NO" on the petition. If more than one person owns the property, all parties shall sign the petition individually to be counted. Renting tenants are not an acceptable substitute for the legal property owner and may not sign petitions as related to this program. No valid signature shall be withdrawn from the petition after it is filed with the council. Each person signing the petition shall sign before a witness, who shall be available to verify the signature of a property owner. 
                  (Ord. No. 99, 3-10-98) 
                  Sec. 74-56. - Number of signatures required. 
                  A minimum of 75 percent of the property owners on a local residential street must indicate an affirmative preference for the speed hump(s). The percentage shall be calculated by dividing the total number of property owners by the total number of those property owners indicating an affirmative preference. Determining the number of property owners on a local residential street shall be established by the council using the database of the city's taxing authorities. 
                  In the event a street is not completely built out, a minimum of 60 percent of the total number of residences on a street must be occupied before a petition for the installation of speed humps will be considered. 
                  The completed petition must state the name and address of the representative of the petition group, and it must be signed by the representative before a notary public and returned to the council, where it will be checked to insure that all requirements are met. Those petitions failing to meet specified requirements will be returned to the representative for compliance. Petitions meeting all requirements will be presented at the next regular city council meeting for approval or disapproval by the mayor and council. 
                  (Ord. No. 99, 3-10-98) 
                  Sec. 74-57. - City-initiated petitions and speed humps. 
                  The city council may initiate the gathering of petitions on local residential streets or may undertake, at expense to the general public, the installation, maintenance, and/or removal of speed humps on its rights-of-way or other city-owned properties when such are found to be in the general public interest and for the purpose of the general health, safety and welfare.

                  Sec. 74-58. - Construction; warning posted. 
                  The geometric design of speed humps has been proven to be a critical factor in terms of their safety and effectiveness in lowering speed. Based on extensive research, speed humps shall be constructed with the following specifications: Four inches maximum vertical rise, 22 feet in horizontal length, and incline flat-top-decline. Each individual speed hump location shall require posting of standard warning signs that will be installed along the back of the curb within the city-owned right-of-way. At the discretion of the city, speed humps may be located in intersections as a means of controlling pedestrian crossings and slowing traffic turning. In these instances, the speed hump shall be known as a "speed table" and shall be modified in design to meet the requirements of the intersection. The installation of the speed humps shall be completed, weather permitting, in approximately four months or less from the date the petition is approved by the mayor and council.

                  Sec. 74-59. - Procedure for removal. 
                  Other than as described in section 74-57 above, the city shall remove speed humps only under the following conditions: 
                  (1)  A formal petition in the form prescribed in section 74-55 above shall be filed with the council indicating that 75 percent of the property owners request the removal of the speed humps. In the event the local residential street is not completely built out, a minimum of 60 percent of the number of residences must be occupied before a petition for the removal of speed humps will be considered; 
                  (2)  The petition shall contain a statement acknowledging that the property owners are aware of the probability that vehicular traffic speeds on their street may increase after the speed humps are removed; and 
                  (3)  The speed humps shall not have been installed less than one year from the date of receipt of the petition.

                  Sec. 74-60. - Charges for installation and removal. 
                  The property owner's portion of the charges associated with the installation and removal of speed humps shall be at a level that adequately covers 75 percent of the direct and indirect costs as determined by the council. All rates may be subject to change to reflect material and labor increases to the city. 
                  All costs associated with the installation or removal of the speed hump as determined and itemized by the council shall have been paid in full prior to work being performed by the city.

                  Sec. 74-62. - Utility registration. 
                  (a)  Registration required. Each utility who occupies, uses or has facilities in the rights-of-way at the time of passage of this article, including by lease, sublease or assignment, to operate facilities located in the rights-of-way, unless specifically exempted by state or federal law or this Code, shall file a registration statement with the department within 90 days of the effective date of the ordinance codified herein. 
                  (b)  Registration procedure. The registration information provided to the city shall be on a form approved by the city and include, but not be limited to: 
                  (1)  The name, legal status (i.e. partnership, corporation, etc.), street address, email address, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the utility filing the registration statement (the "registrant"). If the registrant is not the owner of the facility in the right-of-way, the registration shall include the name, street address, email address if applicable, and telephone and facsimile numbers of the owner; 
                  (2)  The name, street address, email address if applicable and telephone and facsimile numbers of one or more facilities representative(s).

                  (d)  Acceptance of the registration shall not convey title in the rights-of-way. Acceptance of the registration is only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy rights-of-way in the city for the limited purposes stated in the acceptance.

Beginning one year after the effective date of this article, any facilities or part of a facility found in a right-of-way for which registration is required but has not been obtained unless specifically exempted by law, and for which no valid service agreement exists with the city, may be deemed to be a nuisance and an unauthorized use of the rights-of-way. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to abating the nuisance; taking possession of the facilities, evicting the utility from the right-of-way; prosecuting the violator; and/or any other remedy provided by city ordinance or otherwise allowed in law or in equity.

                  (1)  Whether issuing of the approval will be consistent with this article; and 
                  (2)  Whether applicant has submitted a complete application and has secured all certificates and other authorizations required by law, if applicable, in order to construct facilities in the manner proposed by the applicant; and 
                  (3)  The impact on safety, visual quality of the streets, traffic flow, and other users of the right-of-way and the difficulty and length of time of the project, construction or maintenance. 
                  (e)  Emergency situations. 
                  (1)  Each utility shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, notify the director of any event regarding its facilities which it considers to be an emergency. The utility may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. A utility who engages in an emergency excavation shall take all reasonable precautions to avoid or minimize damage to any existing facilities. 
                  (2)  In the event that the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding utility facilities, the city may attempt to contact the affected utility or facilities representative. The city may take whatever action it deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, including cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers, appliances, or other parts of the facilities. The city shall not incur any liability to the utility, for such emergency actions, and the cost of such shall be paid by each utility affected by the emergency. 
                  (f)  Effective period of permit. 
                  (1)  Each permit shall have a set commencement and expiration date based on information provided in the applicant's permit application. 
                  (2)  The permit shall remain in place until construction is completed or until its expiration date unless the utility is in default. The director may give written notice of default to a utility if it is determined that a utility has: 
                  a.  Violated any provision or requirement of the issuance or acceptance of a permit application or any law of the city, state or federal government;

                  (g)  Cancellation for cause. If a utility fails to cure a default within 20 working days after such notice is provided to the utility by the city, then such default shall be a material breach and city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity to terminate the permit. If the director decides there is cause or reason to terminate, the following procedure shall be followed: 
                  (1)  City shall serve a utility with a written notice of the reason or cause for proposed termination and shall allow a utility a minimum of 15 calendar days to cure its breach. 
                  (2)  If the utility fails to cure within 15 calendar days, the city may declare the permit terminated. 
                  (h)  Expiration of permit. If work is not begun within six months of the date of issuance, the permit will automatically expire.

                  Sec. 74-64. - Required minimum standards. 
                  (a)  Utility accommodation manual adopted. The 2009 Utility Accommodation Policy and Standards Manual, including all references contained therein to codes, rules, regulations, schedules, forms and appendix items, except Appendix B (Permit Forms and Supporting Documents), promulgated by the State of Georgia Department of Transportation, as may be amended from time to time is hereby adopted by reference and incorporated in this section as if fully set forth herein, subject to the amendments and modification contained in this article. A copy of the manual shall be maintained at the offices of the director or his designee and open for public inspection.

References to state personnel, agencies, and fees shall be interpreted, where required, as meaning the City of Hampton municipal equivalents. 
                  (b)  Protection of traffic and roadway. Unless specifically in the permit, no utility may occupy the city rights-of-way unless sufficient space is available so that the free flow and safety of traffic and other capacity considerations are not unduly impaired and the installation does not prevent the department from reasonably maintaining the streets, structures, traffic control devices and other appurtenant facilities, and further provided that maintenance and operations of the facilities do not jeopardize the traffic, street structure, other users of the right-of-way or the right-of-way itself. 
                  (c)  Grading. If the grades or lines of any street within the city right-of-way are changed at any time by the city during the term of the permit and this change involves an area in which the utility's facilities are located, then the utility shall, at its own cost and expense and upon the request of the city upon reasonable notice, protect or promptly alter or relocate the facilities, or any part thereof, so as to conform with such new grades or lines. In the event the utility refuses or neglects to so protect, alter, or relocate all or part of the facilities, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter or relocated all or any part of the facilities without any liability to the utility and the utility shall pay to the city the costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alteration or relocation. 
                  (d)  Installation of poles and other wire-holding structures and relocation. Unless otherwise provided in a valid service agreement, no placement of any pole or wire-holding structure of the utility is to be considered a vested interest in the right-of-way, and such poles or structures are to be removed, relocated underground, or modified by the utility at its own expense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The facilities shall be so located and installed as to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners. 
                  (e)  As provided in O.C.G.A § 25-9-6 (the Georgia Utility Facility Protection Act) and other applicable state law currently in place or as amended, no utility shall commence, perform, or engage in blasting or in excavating with mechanized excavating facilities unless and until the utility planning the blasting or excavating has given 48 hours' notice by submitting a locate request to the utility protection center, beginning the next working day after such notice is provided, excluding hours during days other than working days.

                  (b)  At any time, including the time of inspection, the director may order the immediate cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the health, safety, or welfare of the public, violates any law, or which violates the terms and conditions of the permit and/or this article or issue an order to correct work which does not conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or codes. 
                  (c)  When the construction under any permit is completed, the utility shall notify the department.

                  Sec. 74-68. - Penalties. 
                  Every utility convicted of a violation of any provision of this article shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00 per violation.

                  Sec. 74-69. - Other provisions. 
                  (a)  Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this article is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. 
                  (b)  Reservation of regulatory and police powers. The city by issuing a written approval of registration under this article, does not surrender or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the lawful powers and rights, which it has now or may be hereafter vested in the city under the Constitution and laws of the United States, State of Georgia and the city Charter, and under the provisions of the city's codified ordinances to regulate the use of the rights-of-way. The utility by applying for and being issued a written permit, is deemed to acknowledge that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as are or the same may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the city, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by the city at any time. A utility is deemed to acknowledge that its interests are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general laws enacted by the city pursuant to such powers. In particular, all utilities shall comply with city zoning and other land use requirements pertaining to the placement and specifications of facilities. 
                  (c)  Compliance. No person shall be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this article by reason of any failure of city to enforce compliance.

All amounts of such tax shall be due and payable to the city clerk monthly on or before the 20th day of every month next succeeding each respective monthly period. The tax shall become delinquent for each monthly period after the 20th day of each succeeding month during which it remains unpaid. 
                  (b)  Penalty and interest for failure to pay tax by due date. An operator who fails to make any return or to pay the amount of tax as prescribed, shall be assessed a specific penalty to be added to the tax in the amount of five percent or $5.00, whichever is greater, if the failure is for one month or less; and an additional five percent or $5.00, whichever is greater, for each additional month or fraction thereof in which such failure shall continue; provided, however, that the aggregate penalty for any single violation shall not exceed 25 percent or $25.00, whichever is greater. Delinquent amounts shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, until paid. 
                  (c)  Acceptance of delinquent return and remittance without imposing penalty and interest; authority; requirements. If the failure to make any return or to pay the amount of tax by the due date results from providential cause shown to the satisfaction of the governing authority of the city by affidavit attached to the return, and remittance is made within ten days of the due date, such may be accepted exclusive of penalty and interest. 
                  (d)  Waiving of penalty and interest; authority. O.C.G.A. § 48-2-41, relating to the authority to waive interest, and § 48-2-43, relating to the authority to waive penalty, shall apply; provided, however, that the governing authority shall stand in lieu of the Georgia Commissioner of Revenue, and the city shall stand in lieu of the state.

The return shall report the gross rent, taxable rent, exempt rent, amount of tax collected or otherwise due for the period, and such other information as may be required by the city clerk. However, if the estimated tax liability for any monthly period shall exceed $2,500.00 in any three consecutive months, such operator shall file an estimated return and remit not less than 50 percent of the estimated tax liability for the monthly period by the 20th day of that same monthly period. The amount of tax so remitted shall be credited against the amount to be due with the regular return for the monthly period to be filed on the 20th day of the succeeding month. 
                  (g)  Extension of time of filing; authority; requirements; remittance; penalty and interest. The governing authority of the city may, for good cause, extend the time for making returns for not longer than 30 days. No extension shall be valid unless granted in writing upon written application of the operator. Such grant may not be applicable for longer period than 12 consecutive months. An operator granted an extension shall remit tax equaling not less than 100 percent of the tax paid for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year; such remittance to be made on or before the date the tax would otherwise come due without the grant of extension. No penalty or interest shall be charged during the first ten days of the extension period. 
                  (h)  Collection fee allowed operators. Operators collecting the tax shall be allowed a percentage of the tax due and accounted for and shall be reimbursed in the form of a deduction in submitting, reporting and paying the amount due, if the amount is not delinquent at the time of payment. The rate of the deduction shall be three percent of the amount due, but only if the amount due was not delinquent at the time of payment.

One or more deficiency determinations may be made of the amount due for one or more monthly periods. 
                  (b)  Penalty and interest for failure to pay tax. Penalty and interest shall be assessed upon the amount of any determination, as provided by section 78-76. 
                  (c)  Notice of determination; service of. The city clerk shall give to the operator written notice of the clerk's determination.

                  (d)  Time within which notice of deficiency determination to be mailed.

                  (1)  Fee. The water tap on fee shall be a nonrefundable connection fee which shall consist of the total of a water system impact fee plus the cost to the city of connecting the building to the water system. The water system impact fee shall be determined from the impact fee schedule on file in the office of the city clerk. For uses not listed in such schedule, the water system impact fee shall be determined by multiplying the per-gallon-per-day fee shown in such schedule times the average daily water consumption of the proposed use in gallons per day. The cost of water connection shall be the actual cost of the connection to the city, including all direct and indirect costs of materials, labor and equipment, as determined by the mayor from time to time. 
                  (2)  Collection of connection fees. All fees for connection to the water system shall be paid as a prerequisite for approval of such connection to the water system. The following shall control the collection of such fees: 
                  a.  The city may accept a deposit reflecting the estimated cost to the city of connecting the use to water, pending final determination of actual costs after the work has been completed. 
                  b.  Fees paid on the basis of the impact fee schedule on file in the office of the city clerk, to which the direct cost of connection has been added, shall be nonrefundable and constitute full and complete payment unless the city determines that the average daily usage exceeds the amount of usage contemplated under the fees set forth in such schedule. If the city determines that the average daily usage exceeds such amount, the city shall bill the owner of the property an additional impact fee, which fee shall be due within 30 days of receipt of such bill. 
                  c.  Fees calculated on average daily usage basis: 
                  1.  For water impact fees proposed to be calculated on the basis of average gallon-per-day usage instead of the impact fee schedule, the applicant shall present credible evidence prepared, certified and sealed by a knowledgeable professional engineer (P.E.) registered in the state acceptable to the city, or other person acceptable to the city, regarding the projected water usage of the proposed use. Such evidence shall be based on other similar uses, historical water usage by the same type of use, engineering calculations based on accepted standards and practices, or other data or procedures acceptable to the city. 
                  2.  The payment of an impact fee calculated on the basis of average daily usage may be accepted by the city as a conditional payment, pending actual water usage experienced by the use over a 12-month period of full operation or occupancy. 
                  3.  Impact fees paid under the above-stated calculation are nonrefundable. If there is any expansion or increase in the average daily usage, additional impact fees shall be collected by the city based upon the amount of the impact fee that is in existence as of the date of the determination of the expansion or the increased daily usage. The additional fee shall be due within 30 days of receipt of such bill. 
                  d.  The mayor or his designee shall have the authority to interpret this chapter and the calculation of appropriate connection fees, including both impact fees and direct connection costs to the city. Any aggrieved applicant for connection to the water system may appeal the decision of the mayor to the city council, whose determination shall be final.

                  Sec. 86-133. - Sewer connection fee. 
                  The owner or his agent shall make application for connection to the city's sewer system on forms furnished by the city. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the city. Prior to the connection of any use or building to the city's sewer system, a fee shall be paid as provided in the schedule of fees and charges on file in the office of the city clerk. 
                  (1)  Fee. The sewer tap on fee shall be a nonrefundable connection fee which shall consist of the total of a sewer system impact fee plus the cost to the city of connecting the building to the sewer system. The sewer system impact fee shall be determined from the impact fee schedule on file in the office of the city clerk. For uses not listed in such schedule, the sewer system impact fee shall be determined by multiplying the per-gallon-per-day fee shown in such schedule times the average daily water consumption of the proposed use in gallons per day. The cost of sewer connection shall be the actual cost of the connection to the city, including all direct and indirect costs of materials, labor and equipment, as determined by the mayor from time to time. 
                  (2)  Collection of connection fees. All fees for connection to the sewer system shall be paid as a prerequisite for approval of such connection to the sewer system. The following shall control the collection of such fees: 
                  a.  The city may accept a deposit reflecting the estimated cost to the city of connecting the use to sewer, pending final determination of actual costs after the work has been completed. 
                  b.  Fees paid on the basis of the impact fee schedule shown on Exhibit B, on file in the office of the city clerk, and incorporated by reference herein, to which the direct cost of connection has been added, shall be nonrefundable and constitute full and complete payment unless the city determines that the average daily usage exceeds the amount of usage contemplated under the fees set forth in such schedule. If the city determines that the average daily usage exceeds such amount, the city shall bill the owner of the property an additional impact fee, which fee shall be due within 30 days of receipt of such bill. 
                  c.  Fees calculated on average daily usage basis: 
                  1.  For sewer impact fees proposed to be calculated on the basis of average gallon-per-day usage instead of the impact fee schedule, the applicant shall present credible evidence prepared, certified and sealed by a knowledgeable professional engineer (P.E.) registered in the state acceptable to the city, or other person acceptable to the city, regarding the projected water usage of the proposed use. Such evidence shall be based on other similar uses, historical water usage by the same type of use, engineering calculations based on accepted standards and practices, or other data or procedures acceptable to the city. 
                  2.  The payment of an impact fee calculated on the basis of average daily usage may be accepted by the city as a conditional payment, pending actual water usage experienced by the use over a 12-month period of full operation or occupancy. 
                  3.  Impact fees paid under the above-stated calculation are nonrefundable. If there is any expansion or increase in the average daily usage, additional impact fees shall be collected by the city based upon the amount of the impact fee that is in existence as of the date of the determination of the expansion or the increased daily usage. The additional fee shall be due within 30 days of receipt of such bill. 
                  d.  The mayor, or his designee, shall have the authority to interpret this chapter and the calculation of appropriate connection fees, including both impact fees and direct connection costs to the city. Any aggrieved applicant for connection to the sewer system may appeal the decision of the mayor to the city council, whose determination shall be final.

                  Sec. 86-135. - Water and sewer connection fee amendments. 
                  (a)  Short title. This section shall be known as the Water and Sewer Connection Fee Act of 2002. 
                  (b)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate the use and development of land so as to assure that new development bears a proportionate share of the cost of system improvements necessary to provide water and sewer service and facilities in the city. 
                  (c)  Definitions. For purposes of this section and chapter 86 generally, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: 
                  Capital improvement means an improvement with a useful life of ten years or more, by new construction or other action, which increases the service capacity of the water or sewer system. 
                  Capital improvements element means that portion of the comprehensive plan, which sets out projected needs for system improvements during a planning horizon established in the comprehensive plan, a schedule of capital improvements that will meet the anticipated need for system improvements, and a description of anticipated funding sources for each required improvement. 
                  City means the City of Hampton or its designee. 
                  Comprehensive plan means the Henry County/Cities Joint Comprehensive Development Plan. 
                  Development impact fee district means the City of Hampton. 
                  Project improvements means site improvements and facilities that are planned and designed to provide water or sewer service for a particular development project and that are necessary for the use and convenience for the occupants or users of the project and are not system improvements. The character of the improvement shall control a determination of whether an improvement is a project improvement or system improvement and the physical location of the improvement on-site or off-site shall not be considered determinative of whether an improvement is a project improvement or a system improvement. If an improvement or facility provides or will provide more than incidental service or facilities capacity to persons other than users or occupants of a particular project, the improvement or facility is a system improvement and shall not be considered a project improvement. 
                  Proportionate share means that portion of the cost of system improvements which is reasonably related to the demands and needs of a project. 
                  System improvements means capital improvements that are water facilities, sewage facilities, or other facilities which are designed to provide water and sewage services to the community at large, in contrast to project improvements. 
                  System improvement costs means costs incurred to provide additional water or sewer capacity needed to serve new growth and development for planning, design and construction, land acquisition, land improvements, design and engineering related thereto, including the cost of constructing or reconstructing system improvements or facility expansions, including but not limited to the construction contract price, surveying and engineering fees, related land acquisition costs (including land purchases, court award and costs, attorney's fees, and expert witness fees) and expenses incurred for qualified staff or any qualified engineer, planner, architect, landscape architect, or financial consultant for preparing or updating the capital improvement element, and administrative costs equal to three percent of the total amount of the costs. System improvement costs shall also include projected interest charges and other finance costs if and to the development impact fees are to be used for the payment of principal and interest on bonds, notes, or other financial obligations issued by or on behalf of the city to refinance the capital improvement elements. Such costs do not include routine and periodic maintenance expenditures, personnel training, and other operating costs. 
                  (d)  Background. The Development Impact Fee Act ("DIFA") of 1990, codified at O.C.G.A. § 36-71-1 et seq., and as amended, established certain requirements for municipalities seeking to adopt impact fees. In 1993, the City of Hampton ("city") engaged an urban planning firm to review water and sewer service needs of city residents and to issue a report outlining what type of connection and tap-on fees the city could charge to cover costs associated with providing utility services. 
                  The urban planning firm issued a report shortly thereafter ("the 1993 Report"), and the city relied on it in adopting Ordinance No. 77, later codified in chapter 86. These provisions established rules and regulations to govern water and sewer service in the city and impact fees and other costs to be assessed prior to establishment of service. 
                  The fees and charges set forth in chapter 86 remained unchanged for several years. In the meantime, however, the city faced tremendous population growth and a dramatic increase in the need for water and sewer service. 
                  The city recently responded by engaging another urban planning firm to update the 1993 Report. A revised "Water And Sewer Connection Fee Analysis" was issued in draft form in January of 2002 ("the 2002 report"), and it details the costs associated with providing water and sewer service to new residents in the future. Because the city's current water and sewer system may not be sufficient to provide for future needs of the city, the city intends to rely on the 2002 report in amending the fees and charges set forth in chapter 86. 
                  The water and sewer hook up and connection fees referred to in chapter 86 are charged by the city, not a local government authority. Moreover, the capital recovery portion of the new fees (collected for system improvements) to be charged pursuant to this section do not exceed the development's fair proportionate share of those improvements, and the fees are at or below the maximum tap-on fees that could be established by law. 
                  Under the circumstances, many of the procedural requirements imposed by DIFA are inapplicable. Nevertheless, the city finds that the comprehensive planning requirements adopted by the state may still be useful as a guide in responding to present and future development needs. 
                  (e)  Acceptance of 2002 report and adoption of findings. Upon due consideration of the 2002 report, related information and materials on file with the city, and public comments, if any, submitted on the subject and reflected in official city minutes, the city hereby accepts the 2002 report and exhibits, if any, incorporated by reference, and adopts the findings and recommendations contained therein. 
                  (f)  Imposition of amended connection fees. To the extent that an owner or his agent shall be required to pay a fee or fees pursuant to section 86-132 or section 86-133, the following shall control: 
                  (1)  Any person who after the effective date of this section seeks to connect to the city's water system or sewer system shall pay an amended connection fee or fees in the manner and amount set forth in this section. 
                  (2)  No permit for any activity requiring payments of an amended connection fee or fees pursuant to this section shall be issued by the city or its designee unless and until the required fee or fees has been paid. 
                  (g)  Computation of the amount of connection fees for water and sewer taps. 
                  (1)  At the option of an owner or his agent, the amount of the connection fees for water and sewer taps shall be those set forth in Table 17 of the 2002 report, a copy of which is incorporated by reference and shall be maintained on file with the city clerk for public inspection. 
                  (2)  If an owner or agent shall elect not to have the connection fees for water and sewer taps determined according to subsection (g)(1) of this section, then pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-71-4(g) the developer may apply for individual fee determination. A developer applying for an individual fee determination shall prepare and submit to the city manager an individual fee calculation study for the development activity for which a building permit is sought. The individual fee calculation study shall: (i) follow the prescribed methodologies and formats for the study established on page 25 of the 2002 report; or (ii) only to the extent required by state law, and subject to approval by the city, such other professionally accepted methodology that identifies a project's proportionate share. In the event another methodology is utilized, the documentation shall be prepared and presented by qualified professionals in their respective fields and shall follow best professional practices and methodologies. 
                  The city shall provide an owner with an individual fee determination consistent with the 2002 report within 30 days after presentation of the individual fee calculation study. 
                  (h)  Allocation and use of funds. All fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be properly identified and promptly transferred for deposit into the appropriate fund(s) pursuant to applicable law. Fees shall be used solely for the purposes specified in this chapter. 
                  (1)  Fees collected pursuant to this section shall be used for system improvements. No funds shall be used for periodic or routine maintenance or for any purpose not in accordance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 36-71-8. 
                  (2)  Fees shall be used exclusively for system improvements in the development impact fee district in which the project for which the fees were paid is located. 
                  (3)  Fees shall be expended in the order in which they are collected. 
                  (4)  Each fiscal period the city manager shall present to the mayor and council an annual report describing the amount of fees collected, encumbered and used during the preceding year allocated to the development impact fee district and any future districts established by the city. Monies, including any accrued interest, not assigned in any fiscal period shall be retained in the same fund until the next fiscal period except as provided elsewhere in this section. 
                  (5)  The city shall be entitled to retain up to three percent of all fees it collects under this section as an administrative fee to offset the costs of administering this section. 
                  (i)  Credits. Credits against water and sewer connection fees shall be given as follows: 
                  (1)  No credit shall be given for project improvements. 
                  (2)  Credit shall be given for the present value of the construction of improvements or contribution or dedication of land or money by an owner subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives and required or accepted by the city from the owner or his predecessor in title for system improvements (the "post-ordinance credits"). 
                  a.  A person claiming post-ordinance credits shall submit to the city manager a project description in sufficient detail to allow the city manager to prepare an engineering and construction cost estimate. A person proposing credit for system improvements shall present cost estimates and property appraisals prepared by qualified professionals to be used by the city manager in determining the amount of the credit. All construction must be made in accordance with applicable city, county or state development and design standards. A person proposing post-ordinance credits for land dedication shall present the city manager with property appraisals prepared by qualified professionals and a certified copy of the most recent assessment of the property for tax purposes to be used by the city manager in determining the amount of credit. However, the city manager retains the right to determine the amount to be credited by preparing engineering and construction cost estimates and/or property appraisals for those improvements. 
                  b.  Post-ordinance credits must be claimed at the time of the application for a permit. any credit not so claimed shall be deemed waived. 
                  (j)  Refunds. Refunds of connection fees shall be made only in the following instance(s) and in the following manner: 
                  (1)  Upon application to the city manager by the owner, the city shall refund 97 percent of the fee paid if: (i) capacity is available and service is denied; or (ii) any other basis for a refund exists which is required by state law. The city shall retain three percent of the fee paid as an administrative fee. 
                  (2)  A refund application shall be made to the city manager within one year from the date such refund becomes payable hereunder. Any refund not applied for within said time period shall be deemed waived. 
                  (3)  A refund application shall include information and documentation sufficient to permit the city manager to determine whether the refund claimed is proper, and, if so, the amount of such refund. 
                  (4)  A refund shall include a pro rata share of interest actually earned on the unused or excess development impact fee paid. 
                  (5)  All refunds shall be paid within 60 days after the city determines that such refund is due. 
                  (k)  Review of connection fee structure. The connection fee structure shall be reviewed by the mayor and the council annually; provided, however, the failure to review such structure shall not invalidate this section. 
                  (l)  Penalty and enforcement provisions. A violation of this section shall be a petty offense punishable according to Code section 1-11; however, in addition to or in lieu of any criminal prosecution, the city shall have the power to sue for relief in civil court to enforce the provisions of this section. Knowingly furnishing false information to the city on any matter relating to the administration of this section or chapter 86 shall constitute a violation thereof. 
                  (m)  Acceptance of 2007 report and adoption of findings. Finding that the current rates for water and sewer connection fees are no longer sufficient to provide for the city's future needs, the city engaged Ross and Associates to prepare a revised "water and sewer connection fee analysis" which was considered and accepted by the city in November 2007 ("the 2007 report"). The 2007 report details the costs associated with providing water and sewer service to new residents of the city. The city hereby adopts the water and sewer installation cost estimate found in Table 28 of the 2007 report, attached to Ordinance No. 295 and incorporated herein by reference as Exhibit "B". A copy of the 2007 report shall be maintained on file in the office of the city clerk and be available for public inspection.

                  Sec. 86-198. - Prevention and mitigation of identity theft. 
                  (a)  In the event that any city employee responsible for or involved in restoring an existing covered account or accepting payment for a covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect to existing covered accounts, such employee shall use his or her discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his or her discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the city clerk. If, in his or her discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the city clerk, who may in his or her discretion determine that no further action is necessary. If the city clerk in his or her discretion determines that further action is necessary, the city employee shall perform one or more of the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by the city clerk: 
                  (1)  Contact the customer;

                  (4)  Notify a debt collector within 48 hours of the discovery of likely or probable identity theft relating to a customer account that has been sold to such debt collector in the event that a customer's account has been sold to a debt collector prior to the discovery of the likelihood or probability of identity theft relating to such account; 
                  (5)  Notify law enforcement, in the event that someone other than the customer has accessed the customer's account causing additional charges to accrue or accessing personal identifying information; and 
                  (6)  Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate identity theft. 
                  (b)  In the event that any city employee responsible for or involved in opening a new covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect to an application for a new account, such employee shall use his or her discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his or her discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the city clerk. If, in his or her discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the city clerk, who may in his or her discretion determine that no further action is necessary. If the city clerk in his or her discretion determines that further action is necessary, a city employee shall perform one or more of the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by the city clerk: 
                  (1)  Request additional identifying information from the applicant; 
                  (2)  Deny the application for the new account and notify the applicant as to the reason(s) for denial;

                  The city clerk is responsible for oversight of the program and for program implementation. The city council is responsible for reviewing reports prepared by the city clerk and his or her staff regarding compliance with red flag requirements and with making material changes to the program, as may be recommended by the city clerk to address changing identity theft risks and to identity new or discontinued types of covered accounts. 
                  (1)  The city clerk will report to the city council at least annually, on compliance with red flag requirements. The report will address material matters related to the program and evaluate issues such as: 
                  a.  The effectiveness of the policies and procedures of the city in addressing the risk of identity theft in connection with the opening of covered accounts and with respect to existing covered accounts; 
                  b.  Service provider arrangements;

                  Tree, small means either evergreen or deciduous trees or shrubs which do not normally exceed 12 feet in height at maturity. 
                  Tree, specimen means any tree which has been determined by the city tree board or its authorized agent(s) to be of high value because of its type, size, age or other professional criteria, and has been so designated according to administrative standards established by the city tree board or authorized agent(s). 
                  Tree, street means either evergreen or deciduous trees or shrubs growing on land lying within the public right-of-way on either side of all streets, avenues or ways within the city. 
                  Tree bank means a site, such as a school or public park, where the owner/developer shall donate and plant the required trees when it is not feasible to plant the required trees within their site's project area. 
                  Tree removal permit means that written authorization or certificate issued by the city to allow an applicant to plant, cut, prune or remove protected, heritage or specimen within the city (not to be confused with a business license to perform such operations on a contract basis on public property).

                  Tree understory means any tree, which is of relatively less height and spread than surrounding canopy tree, but still provides shade and a degree of protection to the land and vegetation beneath said tree. Examples include; dogwood, cherry, red bud, sassafras, crabapple, pear, American holly, red cedar and magnolia. 
                  Tributary means any perennial stream (or portion thereof) within the affected area that is portrayed as a solid blue line on the United States Geological Survey 7.5 Quadrangle Maps, 1968 edition, and any amendments thereto, or other perennial streams as identified by the city. 
                  Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.
