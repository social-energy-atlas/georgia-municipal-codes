         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of Polk County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2006 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Board of Commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

                  Be it Ordained by the Board of Commissioners of Polk County, Georgia: 
                  Section 1. The Code entitled "The Code of Polk County, Georgia," published by Municipal Code Corporation, consisting of chapters 1 through 113, each inclusive, is adopted. 
                  Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before February 1, 2005, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. 
                  Section 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
                  Section 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 60 days, or any combination thereof. Except as otherwise provided, with respect to violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time, each day the violation continues is a separate offense and with respect to violations of this Code that are not continuous with respect to time, each act is a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the county may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
                  Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the Board of Commissioners to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments. 
                  Section 6. Ordinances adopted after February 1, 2005, that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code.

                  Sec. 1. - Created.

                  (g)  The commissioners shall be elected by those persons who are qualified to vote for members of the General Assembly. No person shall be elected from any commissioner district unless such person shall have been a resident of that commissioner district for a period of at least one year immediately preceding the date of election.

                  (b)  The chairman of the Polk County Board of Elections and Registration shall publish a notice of the vacancy once a week for four consecutive weeks in the legal organ of Polk County, and such notice shall advise potential candidates of the materials and qualifications required for any member of the public to offer for the filling of the vacant seat. All such information as required by the chairman of the Polk County Board of Elections and Registration shall be sealed and transmitted by the chairman of the Polk County Board of Elections and Registration to the office of the clerk of the Superior Court of Polk County for consideration by the grand jury during its next convening session.

Said bond shall be for the faithful performance of the duties of the office of Commissioner and may be sued upon by the Judge of the Probate Court on his motion, or by direction or request of the grand jury, and any Commissioner and his sureties shall be liable for any breach thereof by way of malfeasance in office, or for any neglect of duty.

                  The regular meeting of the board of county commissioners shall be the first Tuesday in each month and shall be held at the county courthouse or other public facility location which has been properly advertised as to date, time, and place of such meeting. At the first regular or special meeting of the board in each calendar year hereafter, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the board shall elect a chairman who shall serve for one year, or until his successor is elected and qualified. It shall be the duty of the chairman to preside at all meetings of the board; to approve and sign the minutes of each meeting; to sign, as chairman, all warrants on the county treasury and all orders and processes of said board of commissioners. 
                  At said meeting the board shall also elect a vice-chairman to act in the absence, or in the event of disability or disqualification of the chairman, and which vice-chairman, when acting, shall exercise all the duties and powers of the chairman. The chairman or vice-chairman, when acting, shall except as herein provided, perform any and all other duties imposed upon a member of the board of commissioners and in addition shall perform all duties usually incident to and connected with the office of chairman of such board. 
                  The chairman, or vice-chairman when acting, shall not vote except in the event of a tie-vote, in which case he must vote, provided that the chairman or vice-chairman when acting, shall be vested with a veto which he may exercise on any resolution, ordinance, or any other action of said board. The chairman, or vice-chairman when acting, shall have three calendar days, not including the date on which the action to be vetoed was taken, in which to exercise the veto, provided, he shall, prior to the close of the meeting at which said proposed action, resolution or ordinance is adopted, declare his intention to veto. The veto shall be exercised by notifying the clerk of the board in writing. 
                  A two-third's vote of the board members present and voting shall be necessary to override any veto. In the event of the exercise of the veto power by the chairman, or vice-chairman when acting, upon petition in writing by a majority of the board, the chairman or vice-chairman, shall call a special meeting of the board to be held within five days of the presentation of said petition, for the purpose of considering overriding of the veto, and the resolution, ordinance, or action vetoed shall be the first item of business at such special meeting. 
                  Special meetings of the board of commissioners of Polk County, Georgia, may be called at any time by the chairman and must be called at any time by the chairman upon petition by a majority of the members thereof.

The written evaluation will take place on, or within a few days of, the employee's anniversary date of hire.

The county reserves the right to, at any time, amend, revise or terminate the policy.

                  (5)  Staff shall use accrued comp time in a way so as to not disrupt normal departmental functions or create hardships on other employees. Staff are encouraged to use comp time in a manner similar to how it was accrued, i.e., a few hours at a time. 
                  (6)  At any given time an employee shall not have more than 30 hours banked in accrued comp time. 
                  (7)  At the end of each month a department head shall electronically submit to the county clerk and the county manager a copy of their comp time log reflecting data on accrual and utilization of comp time. 
                  (8)  In no case shall accrued comp time be paid as wages to an employee instead of the employee taking time off. 
                  (9)  Employees shall keep a log detailing dates, hours, and reasons for the accrual and when the time was taken. At a minimum, the employee's comp time log shall reflect the following: 

                   
                  The reason would be the reason comp time was necessarily generated, or in the case of using comp time, the reason would simply list using comp time.

                  a.  Falsifying hours earned or worked.

                  d.  Violations of the comp time policy. 
                  (11)  The county manager shall be authorized to have discretion in appropriate cases to temporarily suspend an employee's comp time privileges. The employee would have the right to initiate action to appeal the temporary suspension. 
                  (12)  Violations of the comp time policy shall result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

                  (1)  An employee, sheriff, tax commissioner, probate judge, clerk of court, and chief magistrate with twenty or more years of full time service and retiring from county service after reaching the age of 60 or later.

                  (6)  Ongoing employee. An employee who has been employed by the county for at least one complete standard measurement period. 
                  (7)  Standard stability period.

                  (2)  Every new variable hour and seasonal employee shall also be evaluated at the conclusion of the first full standard measurement period following his/her start date to determine his/her eligibility for county health plan coverage. The employee's status, as determined from the standard measurement period, shall dictate whether or not the employee will be eligible for health plan coverage during the following standard stability period. If an initial stability period ends prior to the start of the next standard stability period for which an employee would be eligible for health plan coverage, there shall be no lapse in health plan coverage between the two stability periods. Otherwise, the employee's health plan coverage shall end on the last day of the following full calendar month after the employee's status is determined to be none-full-time. If an initial stability period and a standard stability period overlap, and an employee is be eligible for health plan coverage during the standard stability period, health plan coverage will continue until the end of the current standard stability period.

                  (a)  Declaration of local emergency . 
                  (1)  Grant of authority . In the event of an actual or threatened occurrence of a disaster or emergency, which may result in the large-scale loss of life, injury, property damage or destruction or in the major disruption of routine community affairs, business or governmental operations in the county and which is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant extraordinary assistance by federal, state and local departments and agencies to supplement the efforts of available public and private resources, the chairman of the board of commissioners may declare a local emergency for Polk County. The form of the declaration shall be similar to that provided in subsection (b) of this Code section. 
                  (2)  Request for state assistance . Consistent with a declaration of local emergency, the chairman may request the governor to provide assistance, provided that the disaster or emergency is beyond the capacity of the county to meet adequately and state assistance is necessary to supplement local efforts to save lives and protect property, public health and safety, or to avert or lessen the threat of a disaster. 
                  (3)  Continuance . The declaration of local emergency shall continue until the chairman finds that emergency conditions no longer exist, at which time, the chairman shall execute and file with the clerk of the board of commissioners a document marking the end of the state of emergency. No state of local emergency shall continue for longer than 30 days, unless renewed by the chairman. The board of commissioners may, by resolution, end a state of local emergency at any time. 
                  (4)  Designee . The chairman of the board of commissioners shall be authorized to appoint a designee to act on behalf of the chairman as specified in the various subsections of this article.

                  (1)  Activation of emergency operations plan . A declaration of emergency by the governor or a declaration of local emergency by the chairman shall automatically activate the county emergency operations plan and shall be the authority for deployment of personnel and use of any forces to which the plan applies and for use or distribution of any supplies, equipment, materials, and facilities assembled, stockpiled or arranged to be made available pursuant to the Georgia Emergency Management Act or any other laws applicable to emergencies or disasters. 
                  a.  The Polk County Emergency Management Agency ("EMA") Director in coordination with the chairman or his designee shall have the legal authority to exercise the powers and discharge the duties conferred upon the emergency management agency, including the implementation of the emergency operations plan, coordination of the emergency responses of public and private agencies and organizations, coordination of recovery efforts with state and federal officials, and inspection of emergency or disaster sites. 
                  b.  In responding and conducting necessary and appropriate investigations, the director or his/her designee is authorized to enter at a reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting sites to identify unsafe structures. The director is authorized to execute a right of entry and/or agreement to use property for these purposes on behalf of the county; however, any such document shall be later presented for ratification at a meeting of the board of commissioners. 
                  c.  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the county who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials. Nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while that individual is in the process of carrying out his or her official duties. 
                  (2)  Emergency powers . Following a declaration of emergency and during the continuance of such state of emergency, the chairman or his designee is authorized to implement local emergency measures to protect life and property or to bring the emergency situation under control. In exercising this authority, the chairman or his designee may cause to become effective any of the following sections of this chapter as appropriate: section 5 (registration of building and repair services) to become effective if the Governor declares a state of emergency; and Section 6 (closed or restricted areas and curfews). If any of these sections are included in a declaration of local emergency, the same shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the board of commissioners and shall be in effect until the declaration of local emergency has terminated. 
                  (3)  Authority to waive procedures and fees . Pursuant to a declaration of emergency, the board of commissioners is authorized to cause to be effective any of the subsections of subsection 4 of this section as appropriate. The implementation of such subsections shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the board of commissioners. 
                  (4)  Additional emergency powers . The chairman of the board of commissioners or his designee shall have, and may exercise for such period as the declared emergency exists or continues, the following additional emergency powers: 
                  a.  To direct and compel the evacuation of all or part of the population from any stricken or threatened area, for the preservation of life or other disaster mitigation, response or recovery;

                  h.  To suspend any law, code provision or regulation prescribing the procedures for conduct of county business, or the orders, rules or regulations of any county agency, if strict compliance with any ordinance, resolution, order, rule or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency or disaster, provided that such suspension shall provide for the minimum deviation from the requirements under the circumstances and further provided that, when practicable, specialists shall be assigned to avoid adverse effects resulting from such suspension; 
                  i.  To provide benefits to citizens upon execution of an intergovernmental agreement for grants to meet disaster-related necessary expenses or serious needs of individuals or families adversely affected by an emergency or disaster in cases where the individuals or families are unable to meet the expenses or needs from other means, provided that such grants are authorized only when matching state or federal funds are available for such purposes; 
                  j.  To perform and exercise such other functions, powers and duties as may be deemed necessary to promote and secure the safety and protection of the civilian population, including individuals with household pets and service animals prior to, during and following a major disaster or emergency.

Any person who violates any provision in this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 60 days, or both such fine and imprisonment, for each violation.

                  Sec. 14-27. - Authority to waive procedures and fee structures 
                  (a)  County business. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or chairman of the board of commissioners, the affairs and business of the county may be conducted at places other than the regular or usual location, within or outside of the county, when it is not prudent, expedient or possible to conduct business at the regular location. When such meetings occur outside of the county, all actions taken by the board of commissioners shall be as valid and binding as if performed within the county. Such meetings may be called by the presiding officer or any two members of the governing body without regard to or compliance with time-consuming procedures and formalities otherwise required by law. [Note: Local legislation should be reviewed to determine whether there are restrictions upon moving the meeting location if it is only a locally declared emergency and not a state of emergency declared by the governor.] 
                  (b)  Public works contracts. Upon declaration of an emergency or disaster by the governor or chairman of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners may contract for public works without letting such contract out to the lowest, responsible bidder and without advertising and posting notification of such contract for four weeks; provided, however, that the emergency must be of such nature that immediate action is required and that the action is necessary for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. Any public works contract entered into pursuant to this subsection shall be entered on the minutes of the county as soon as practical and the nature of the emergency described therein in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-91-22(e). 
                  (c)  Purchasing.

                  (d)  Code enforcement. Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or the chairman of the board of commissioners, the board of commissioners may temporarily suspend the enforcement of the ordinances of the county, or any portion thereof, where the emergency is of such nature that immediate action outside the code is required, such suspension is consistent with the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, and such suspension is not inconsistent with any federal or state statutes or regulations. 
                  (e)  Fees. Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or the chairman of the board of commissioners, the chairman or his designee may temporarily reduce or suspend any permit fees, application fees or other rate structures as necessary to encourage the rebuilding of the areas impacted by the disaster or emergency. The term "fees" include fees or rates charged by the county for building permits, land disturbance permits, zoning applications, special land use permits, temporary land use permits and other fees relating to the reconstruction, repair and clean-up of areas impacted by the disaster or emergency. The term "fees" does not include fees collected by the county on behalf of the state or federal government or fees charged by the county pursuant to a state or federal statute or regulation. 
                  (f)  Temporary dwellings. Upon the declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or chairman of the board of commissioners, the chairman or his designee may issue temporary mobile home, trailer, recreational vehicle or other temporary dwelling structures or parks in any zoning district, even though not otherwise permitted by development code, while the primary dwelling is being repaired, provided that such temporary dwellings or parks are designed by an engineer and the plans are approved by the county health department and development services. The temporary permit shall not exceed six months in duration.

Each day any such entity does business in the unincorporated areas of the county without complying with this article constitutes a separate offense. 
                  (b)  The cost of registration fees in a declared emergency or disaster is fixed at $50.00 per annum. Registration is nontransferable. The cost of the emergency building permit shall be equal to the cost for a building permit under existing regulations. The permit shall only be authorized for repairs.

                  Footnotes: 
                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— An amendment of April 7, 2009, repealed Art. III and enacted a new article as set out herein. The former Art. III, §§ 30-68—30-100, pertained to adult entertainment establishments and derived from the original codification. 

                  Sec. 30-68. - Rationale and findings. 
                  (a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, moral, and general welfare of the citizens of the county, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the county. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
                  (b)  Findings and rationale. Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of adult uses presented in hearings and on findings, interpretations, and narrowing constructions incorporated in the cases of City of Littleton v.

                  (1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. 
                  (2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area. 
                  (3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the county has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the county's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and nonsexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the county's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the county. The county finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.

                  It is unlawful for a sexually oriented business licensee to knowingly violate the following regulations or to knowingly allow an employee or any other person to violate the following regulations. 
                  (1)  It shall be a violation of this article for a patron, employee, or any other person to knowingly or intentionally, in a sexually oriented business, appear in a state of nudity, regardless of whether such public nudity is expressive in nature. 
                  (2)  It shall be a violation of this article for a person to knowingly or intentionally, in a sexually oriented business, appear in a semi-nude condition unless the person is an employee who, while semi-nude, remains at least six feet from any patron or customer and on a stage at least 18 inches from the floor in a room of at least 1,000 square feet. 
                  (3)  It shall be a violation of this article for any employee who regularly appears semi-nude in a sexually oriented business to knowingly or intentionally touch a customer or the clothing of a customer on the premises of a sexually oriented business.

                  Sec. 30-86. - Scienter required to prove violation or business licensee liability. 
                  This article does not impose strict liability. Unless a culpable mental state is otherwise specified herein, a showing of a knowing or reckless mental state is necessary to establish a violation of a provision of this article. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, for the purposes of this article, an act by an employee that constitutes grounds for suspension or revocation of that employee's license shall be imputed to the sexually oriented business licensee for purposes of finding a violation of this article, or for purposes of license denial, suspension, or revocation, only if an officer, director, or general partner, or a person who managed, supervised, or controlled the operation of the business premises, knowingly or recklessly allowed such act to occur on the premises. It shall be a defense to liability that the person to whom liability is imputed was powerless to prevent the act.

If the act required of the county official under this article, and not completed in the time prescribed, includes approval of condition(s) necessary for approval by the county of an applicant or licensee's application for sexually oriented business license or a sexually oriented business employee's license (including a renewal), the license shall be deemed granted and the business or employee allowed to commence operations or employment the day after the deadline for the county's action has passed.

                  (b)  Measurement. For the purpose of this section, measurements shall be made in a straight line in all directions without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the closest part of any structure on the parcel containing the sexually oriented business, including signs and roof overhangs that is used in conjunction with the sexually oriented business, to the closest point on a property boundary or right-of-way associated with any of the land use(s) or zoning districts identified in subsection (a) above. 
                  (c)  Nonconforming uses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Code or the Development Code of Polk County, a sexually oriented business that does not conform to this section but which was legally established and lawfully operating under local and state law prior to the effective date of this article may continue to operate for two years following that date in order to make a reasonable recoupment of its investment in the real property at the current location. At the conclusion of said two years, the use will no longer be recognized as a lawful nonconforming use, and shall be terminated unless an extension of time has been granted, upon a showing of financial hardship, pursuant to the procedure set forth in the following subsection (d). An application for an extension based upon financial hardship ("hardship exception") shall be filed at least 60 days, and not more than 180 days, before the conclusion of the initial two-year period. 
                  (d)  Procedure for seeking hardship extension.

Notice of the time and place of such public hearing shall be mailed to the applicant, shall be published at least ten days before the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation published within the county, and shall contain the particular location for which the hardship extension is requested. At the hearing, all parties shall have the right to offer testimony, documentary and tangible evidence bearing on the issues; may be represented by counsel, and shall have the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses. The hearing officer shall issue a written decision within ten days after the public hearing on the application for a hardship extension. An extension under the provisions of this section shall be for a reasonable period of time commensurate with the investment involved, and shall be approved only if the hearing officer makes all of the following findings or such other findings as are required by law. 
                  (1)  The applicant has made a substantial investment, including but not limited to lease obligations incurred in an arms-length transaction, in the property or structure on or in which the nonconforming use is conducted; such property or structure cannot be readily converted to another, conforming use; and such investment was made prior to the effective date of this article; and 
                  (2)  The applicant will be unable to recoup said investment as of the date established for termination of the use; and 
                  (3)  The applicant has made good faith efforts to recoup the investment and to relocate the use to a location in conformance with this section.

                  (c)  Any order for the correction of violations entered by the county magistrate court shall be subject to review by direct appeal to the county superior court pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

                  Sec. 55-6. - Marking and lighting unserviceable areas including closed runways and taxiways. 
                  (a)  Generally. Applications of the standards and practices contained in the appropriate FAA Advisory Circular, "Marking of Paved Areas on Airports," as amended or superseded, apply when there is a closed or hazardous area on the airport or when a deceptive area exists and the airport manager determines that an operational need exists to mark same. Replace or modify as soon as possible existing markings that are not in the advisory circular. 
                  (b)  Hazardous and unserviceable parts of the air operations area. 
                  (1)  Where a relatively small paved area has failed or for any other reason becomes hazardous for aircraft operation and it is not intended to close the entire area to operations, use red flags not less than 18 inches square for day marking and use red lights or lighted barricades with flags for night marking to delineate the hazardous area. When flags are made of fabric, use a wire stiffener to hold the flag in an extended position. Mount flags so they are not a hazard. 
                  (2)  Where large apron areas are unserviceable, place a cross, as shown by the appropriate FAA advisory circular, in the center of the unserviceable area. If this type movement area is used at night, place red lights to delineate the unserviceable parts of the area. 
                  (3)  On runways or taxiways where the unserviceable area is such as to render the runway or taxiway or portion thereof unusable, place red lights at the entrance to such areas and disconnect controls to the runway or taxiway lights in the section rendered unusable. 
                  (4)  Use red lights of at least ten candlepower for night marking of unserviceable parts of the movement areas. Red lights with a light distribution equivalent to a fixture meeting the requirements in AC 150/5345-2, Specification for L-180 Obstruction Light, are acceptable. 
                  (c)  Closed airports. When the entire air operations area is rendered unsafe by a hazardous condition, declare the field closed and mark as follows: 
                  (1)  Day marking. Place a cross over runway numbers readily visible from the air. Make all crosses in accordance with the current FAA Advisory Circular AC 150/5340-1 as amended or superseded, Marking of Paved Areas on Airports, as amended or superseded. 
                  (2)  Night marking. Disconnect controls to runway, taxiway, lighted wind cone and rotating beacon lights. 
                  (d)  Color. Use aviation yellow for all deceptive, closed, and hazardous area markings. 
                  (e)  Notification. Immediately report closed runways and taxiways, airport hazardous areas and closed airports to the Atlanta Flight Service Station (404-691-1474). 
                  (f)  Safety during construction. These guidelines apply to all construction work, which may affect the movement of aircraft. 
                  (1)  Prior to the development of contract specifications for construction activity affecting aircraft movement areas, safety requirements relating thereto should be coordinated between the airport management and appropriate representatives of the FAA to determine the restrictions required for the project's special provisions, which should result in a minimum of interference to aircraft operations. 
                  (2)  For construction activity to be performed in other than active operational areas, the storage and parking of equipment and materials when not in use or about to be installed should not encroach upon active operational areas. The protection of operational areas shall be in accordance with the current FAA AC 150/5300-13, Airport Design, as amended or superseded. 
                  (3)  Open-flame, welding, or torch cutting operations are to be prohibited, unless adequate fire and safety precautions have been made and approved by the county or its designee. 
                  (4)  Open trenches, excavations, and stockpiled material at the construction-site will be prominently marked with red flags and lighted by red light units (acceptable to the airport manager) during hours of restricted visibility and/or darkness. 
                  (5)  All vehicles will be clearly identified for control purposes, by assigned number prominently displayed on each side. The identifying symbols should be eight-inch minimum, block-type characters of a color easily read on a contrasting background. They may be applied by use of tape or water-soluble paint to facilitate removal. 
                  (6)  All vehicles will follow routes and roadways selected by the airport manager or his representative and stay clear of areas adjacent to NAVAIDS that if traversed could cause emission of false signals or failure of NAVAIDS. These sensitive areas will be identified and clearly marked by the airport engineer. 
                  (7)  The airport engineer will identify and mark with yellow flags the location of all utilities in the construction areas that if interrupted, could cause failure of a facility or NAVAID. 
                  (8)  The airport manager will issue the necessary notices to airmen, (NOTAMs), to reflect hazardous conditions. NOTAMs will be kept current and reflect the actual condition with respect to construction situations, active NOTAMs will be reviewed periodically. 
                  (9)  Frequent inspections will be made by the airport manager during critical phases of the work to insure that the contractor is following the recommended safety procedures.

Failure to comply may be considered as either criminal mischief punishable under criminal law or criminal trespass. 
                  Any person, firm or corporation found to be in violation of any of these rules and regulations shall be punished as follows: 
                  First violation: Verbal warning.

                  A.  Where boundaries are indicated as approximately following the center line right-of-way of streets and alleys, land lot lines, militia district lines or lot lines, such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
                  B.  Where a district boundary divides a lot, the location of such boundaries, unless same are indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on such maps. Split zoned properties shall no longer be permitted, however, those existing on the date of adoption of this article [division] shall be allowed to continue as a nonconforming use. Property owners may request the County rezone the entire property to one of the existing zonings or subdivide the property along the district boundary provided all lot standards are achieved for each newly created lot. 
                  C.  Where a district boundary line divides a lot which was in single ownership at the time of passage of this article [division], the Planning Commission may permit the extension of the regulations for either portion of the lot not to exceed 50 feet beyond the district line into the remaining portion of the lot. 
                  Sec. 704.02. - Uniformity and Compliance. 
                  The regulations set by this article [division] within each district shall be minimum regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or land, and specifically, except as hereinafter provided. 
                  Sec. 704.03. - Compliance with District Regulations.

                  Sec. 704.04. - Lots Reduced Below Requirements.

                  Within the districts established by this article [division] or amendments that may later be adopted there may exist; lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before this article [division] was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this article [division] or such amendment. It is the intent of this article [division] to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this article [division] that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
                  Sec. 706.02. - Continuance of Nonconforming Use. 
                  The lawful use of any building or structure or land existing at the time of enactment of this ordinance or amendment thereto may be continued, even though such use does not conform with the provisions of this article [division], except that the nonconforming use shall not be: 
                  A.  Changed to another nonconforming use; 
                  B.  Reestablished after discontinuance for a continuous period of 6 months or 18 months during any 3 year period (except when government action impedes access to the premises); 
                  C.  Expanded, extended or enlarged in any manner which increase its nonconformity, but such structure may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
                  Sec. 706.03. - Continuance of a Nonconforming Building or Structure. 
                  Any nonconforming building or structure existing as of the date of adoption of this ordinance, may be retained, except that it shall not be: 
                  A.  Expanded, extended or enlarged in any manner which increase its nonconformity. 
                  B.  Rebuilt, altered or repaired if such construction costs would exceed 50% of its replacement cost.

                  Sec. 706.04. - Exceptions. 
                  A.  Nothing in this article [division] shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, provided such construction costs do not exceed 50% of its replacement cost. 
                  B.  In any district in which single family dwellings are permitted, a single family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record existing on January 1, 1999, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this article [division], only so long as it is used for a single family residence. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than these applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements, in order to build upon any such vacant single lot of record, shall be obtained only through action of the Planning Commission. 
                  C.  If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this article [division], and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this article [division], and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this article [division], nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this article [division].

                  Sec. 708.09. - PRD (SF), Planned Residential Development. 
                  A.  Purpose and Intent. The PRD (SF) district is intended to allow flexible site planning and building arrangements under a unified plan of development so that innovative land planning methods may be utilized which foster natural resource conservation and neighborhood cohesiveness as well as neo-traditional developments. This may permit buildings to be clustered or arranged in an unconventional manner to maximize open space, create a pedestrian scale and other public benefits. In this district smaller lots than might otherwise be permitted under traditional zoning districts may be allowed; however, the purpose is not merely to allow smaller lots or reduce development requirements but to achieve other goals including the protection of sensitive environmental, historic, or aesthetic resources as well as the provision of site amenities such as parks, open space, walking trails, etc. The PRD district is not intended to encourage greater density of development, but rather to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning techniques which result in quality residential patterns that conserve and create open space, reduce vehicle trips and provide stable developments which enhance the surrounding area.

                  (Ord. of 6-2-2009(3); Ord. of 12-6-2011; Mo. of 9-19-2013) 
                  Sec. 712.02. - Community Residences. 
                  A.  Intent and Purpose. The Fair Housing Amendment Act (1988) states that local zoning regulations may not prohibit community residences and requires that counties provide "reasonable accommodation" of such uses. Polk County regulates community residences using criteria based upon the actual use of the facility and the number of individuals utilizing its services. This provides individuals with opportunities for normalization instead of institutionalization thereby reducing social costs and fostering personal growth and responsibility while also allowing the County to maintain viable neighborhoods based primarily upon similar single-family or planned multifamily dwellings. 
                  B.  Group Homes. Group homes are defined throughout the entirety of this ordinance as dwellings shared by nonrelated individuals who live together as a single housekeeping unit and in a longterm family-like environment in which staff persons provide care, education and participation in community activities for the residents with the primary goal of enabling the residents to live as independently as possible in order to reach their maximum potential. This use shall also apply to homes for the handicapped; however, the term "handicapped" shall not include current illegal use of or addition to a controlled substance or alcohol, nor shall it include any person whose residency in the home would constitute a direct threat to the health and safety of other individuals. The term "group home for the handicapped" shall not include alcohol or drug treatment centers, work release facilities for convicts or ex-convicts, or other housing serving as an alternative to incarceration. 
                  1.  Group homes with 6 or fewer residents, inclusive of resident staff, are permitted uses within the R-1, R-2, and R-4, zoning districts, provided: 
                  a)  The structure meets all aspects of the Standard Housing Code including minimum dwelling space requirements. 
                  b)  The operator of the group home obtains certification from the appropriate state licensing body. 
                  c)  No other such facility or halfway house is located within 1,000 feet as measured from property line to property line. 
                  2.  Group homes with more than 6 residents, inclusive of resident staff, may be permitted within the R-1, R-2, and R-4 zoning districts only if granted a Special Land Use Permit (SLUP) after a public hearing before the Board of Commissioners. 
                  3.  Group homes may be permitted within R-4, RA-8 and LRO zoning districts (regardless of the number of occupants) if granted a SLUP from the Board of Commissioners. 
                  4.  Group homes are considered permitted uses by right in OI zoning districts, subject to those standards set forth therein. 
                  Sec. 712.03. - Extended Stay Facilities. 
                  A.  Extended Stay Hotels or Motels shall be defined as any hotel or motel in which fifty percent or greater of all guest rooms have facilities for both the storage and preparation of food and which are designed or utilized for weekly or monthly occupancy. 
                  B.  Extended Stay Hotels and Motels are permitted within the OS, and C-1 zoning districts and shall comply with the following restrictions: 
                  1.  All guest rooms which have facilities for both the storage and preparation of food and have less than 300 square feet of floor area are limited to a maximum of 2 persons per such room; however, for all such guest rooms greater than 300 square feet, 1 additional person shall be allowable per each additional 75 square feet of floor area up to and including a maximum of 4 persons. 
                  2.  No more than 10 percent of individual guests shall register, reside in, or occupy any room or rooms within the same licensed facility for more than a 180 day period. 
                  3.  An indoor or fenced outdoor active recreation area shall be provided. The size of each recreation area shall be calculated at a ratio of 5 square feet per room with a minimum provision of 750 square feet. All recreation areas must be approved by the Planning and Zoning Director prior to development to ensure that all applicable safety specifications and standards are met. 
                  4.  No permanent business license shall be issued for the conduct of any business from any guest room of the facility. 
                  5.  No hotel or motel under this section is to be converted to or used as an apartment or condominium without prior approval of Board of Commissioners. Any hotel or motel converted to such use must meet all applicable state and local codes including zoning standards. 
                  6.  Each guest room must be protected with a sprinkler system approved by the fire marshal or their designee. 
                  7.  Each guest room having a stove-top unit or other type burner unit shall be required to also include a maximum 60 minute automatic power off timer for each such unit. 
                  8.  A hard-wired smoke detector shall be provided and installed in each guest room. 
                  9.  No outside storage or permanent parking of equipment or vehicles shall be allowed. 
                  10.  All such facilities shall provide a 25-foot undisturbed buffer from any property zoned for multifamily residential purposes and/or a 50-foot undisturbed buffer from any property zoned for single-family residential purposes. 
                  11.  No building may be placed within 300 feet of any residentially zoned property, inclusive of the required buffer. 
                  12.  These restrictions shall apply to all facilities permitted or expanded after June 1, 2004. 
                  13.  All extended stay facilities shall have a maximum density of 75 guest units per gross acre of development. 
                  Sec. 712.04. - Home Occupations. 
                  A.  Intent and Purpose. Certain occupational uses termed "home occupations" are allowed in dwelling units on the basis that such uses are incidental to the use of the premises as a residence. They have special regulations that apply to ensure that home occupations will not be a detriment to the character and livability of the surrounding neighborhood. The regulations ensure that the accessory home occupation remains subordinate to the residential use and the residential viability of the dwelling is maintained. The regulations recognize that many types of jobs can be done in a home with little or no effect on the surrounding neighborhood and, as such, may be permitted provided such uses: 
                  1.  Are incidental to the use of the premises as a residence; 
                  2.  Are conducted within the bona fide residence of the principal practitioner; 
                  3.  Are compatible with residential uses; 
                  4.  Are limited in extent and do not detract from the residential character of the neighborhood. 
                  B.  Definition of Accessory Home Occupations. There are 2 types of home occupations, Type A and Type B. Permit requirements and uses allowed in each type vary and are allowed only if they comply with all of the requirements of this ordinance. Deviation from any standard requires a variance approval from Board of Commissioners. 
                  1.  In Type A home occupations residents use their home as a place of work, home office or business mailing address. Employees or customers are prohibited from coming to the site. Examples include artists, crafts people, writers and consultants. 
                  2.  In Type B home occupations the resident uses their home for work which requires or results in either employees or customers coming to the site. Examples are counseling, tutoring, family daycare, and single-chair hair cutting and styling. Type B home occupations must obtain a Special Land Use Permit from Board of Commissioners due to their greater possible impact on the surrounding neighborhood as a result of individuals and visitors from outside the neighborhood coming to the property. 
                  C.  General Provisions and Prohibited Uses. All home occupations shall meet the following: 
                  1.  A home occupation shall be incidental and accessory to the use of a dwelling as a residence. No more than 25% of the floor space of the dwelling unit (including attached garages) may be used for the occupation. 
                  2.  There shall be no exterior evidence of the home occupation or alteration of the residence and/or accessory buildings to accommodate the home occupation. External changes which will make the dwelling appear less residential in nature or function are prohibited. Examples of such prohibited alterations include construction of parking lots, paving of required setbacks, or adding commercial-like exterior lighting. Any alteration or addition which expands the floor area of the principal structure dedicated to the home occupation use shall void the existing business license and require a new business license be obtained, subject to property compliance verification by the Department of Planning and Zoning. For Type B home occupations a new public hearing must be held for the rights associated with the Special Land Use Permit to be reestablished. 
                  3.  There shall be no outside operations or exterior storage of inventory or materials to be used in conjunction with a home occupation. 
                  4.  No use or activity may create noise, dust, glare, vibration, smoke, smell, electrical interference or any fire hazard. 
                  5.  All home occupations shall be subject to periodic inspections by the Department of Planning and Zoning. 
                  6.  Any type of repair or assembly of vehicles or equipment with internal combustion engines (such as autos, motorcycles, marine engines, lawn mowers, chain saws and other small engines) or of large appliances (such as washing machines, dryers, and refrigerators) or any other work related to automobiles and their parts is prohibited. 
                  D.  Specific Criteria for Type A Home Occupations. In addition to the general criteria established in Subsection C, Type A home occupations are subject to the following restrictions: 
                  1.  No clients, nonresident employees or customers are allowed on the premises. 
                  2.  Pickups from and deliveries to the site in regard to the business shall be restricted to vehicles which have no more than 2 axles and shall be restricted to no more than 2 pickups or deliveries per day between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. 
                  3.  No signage regarding the home occupation is permitted on the property. 
                  E.  Specific Criteria for Type B Home Occupations. In addition to the general criteria established in Subsection C, Type B home occupations are subject to the following restrictions: 
                  1.  A Special Land Use Permit must be obtained from Board of Commissioners following a public hearing. Board of Commissioners shall consider the desires of the immediate neighborhood, the nature of the proposed business, the availability of parking, traffic generation and any other issue that may detract from the residential character of the area and property values. The public hearing shall follow the same procedures and fees set forth in Division 722. 
                  2.  No Type B home occupation may be established in districts zoned for multifamily residential purposes. 
                  3.  Family day care facilities must be certified by Georgia Department of Human Resources prior to the issuance of a business license and must accompany all applications for a Special Land Use Permit. The number of children allowed by this ordinance shall be calculated at 1 child per 250 gross square feet of the residence. 
                  4.  Two nonresident employees are allowed with a Type B home occupation provided no customers come to the site and adequate parking is provided on-site. Home occupations which have customers coming to the site are not allowed to have nonresident employees (defined as an employee, business partner, co-owner, or other person affiliated with the home occupation, who does not live at the site, but who visits the site as part of the home occupation.) 
                  5.  Retail sales of goods must be entirely accessory to any permitted services provided on the site (such as hair care products sold as an accessory to hair cutting). 
                  6.  No more than 1 Type B home occupation per dwelling is permitted. 
                  7.  Customers may visit the site only between the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. 
                  8.  Each Type B home occupation is permitted signage according to the following criteria: 
                  a)  Sign shall be either an attached wall sign or detached sign only and limited to 6 square feet; 
                  b)  Signs may not be illuminated in any fashion; 
                  c)  No detached sign may exceed 4 feet in height; and 
                  d)  All signs are permitted through the Department of Planning and Zoning.

                  Sec. 712.07. - Telecommunication Towers and Infrastructure. 
                  Towers may be permitted in C-1, I-1, I-2, and OS zoning districts pursuant to those additional restrictions listed herein. 
                  A.  General Requirements. 
                  1.  A Special Land Use Permit granted by Board of Commissioners shall be required for the construction of all new communications towers within the County limits after the following factors are considered: 
                  a)  The proposed height of the tower; 
                  b)  Proximity to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
                  c)  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
                  d)  Surrounding topography, tree coverage and foliage; 
                  e)  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics which have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness. 
                  2.  All permit applications submitted to the Department of Planning and Zoning shall include a complete inventory of the applicant's existing towers and receivers/transmitters located within Polk County including each asset's location, height and collocation usage or capabilities. The Department of Planning and Zoning shall utilize such information to promote collocation alternatives for other applicants. 
                  3.  All applicants must demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the proposed antenna(s). Evidence of an engineering nature shall be documented by the submission of a certification by a qualified engineer. Such evidence may consist of the following: 
                  a)  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  b)  No existing structure is of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
                  c)  No existing tower or structure has sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna(s) and related equipment. 
                  d)  Applicant's proposed antenna(s) would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna(s) on the existing tower or structure. 
                  e)  The fees or costs required to share the existing tower or structure or to adapt the existing tower or structure for shared use are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable. 
                  f)  Such other limiting factor(s) as may be demonstrated by the applicant. 
                  4.  At the time of filing the application for a tower, the applicant shall provide a site plan and information regarding tower location, accessory structures, neighboring uses and proposed landscaping. Documentation must be submitted and certified by a qualified engineer delineating coverage and propagation zones, tower design and collocation capabilities. 
                  5.  In granting a Special Land Use Permit, the Board of Commissioners may impose additional conditions to the extent determined necessary to minimize adverse effects on adjoining properties. 
                  B.  Standards. 
                  1.  All towers must be set back a distance of twice (X 2) the full height of the tower from any residentially zoned property or structure used for residential purposes. 
                  2.  All towers shall be separated from each other by a distance of at least 1,000 feet. 
                  3.  All new self-supporting towers which do not incorporate approved alternative design features must be designed and built in a manner that allows at least 2 other entities to co-locate on the structure. 
                  4.  All towers and their related structures shall maximize the use of building materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that effectively blend the tower facilities within the surrounding natural setting and built environment. Towers shall be painted so as to reduce their visual obtrusiveness, subject to any applicable standards of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 
                  5.  Any tower which directly abuts a residentially zoned property shall have a minimum 50' landscaped buffer with a solid fence or wall no less than 6 feet in height. 
                  6.  All landscaping plans shall be prepared by a registered landscape architect. For each 30 linear feet of perimeter fencing, no less than 2 trees and 2 shrubs shall be installed. The remainder of the property shall be landscaped in accordance with County standards (see standards set forth in Section 712.08). 
                  7.  Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than 6 feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device; provided, however, that such requirements may be waived for alternative design mounting structures. 
                  8.  All towers shall be monopole designed except those located in Heavy Industrial districts that are greater than 150 feet in height. 
                  9.  All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and FAA.

                  11.  Tower heights shall be measured from the existing ground base level to the highest point on the tower or other structure, even if said highest point is an antenna, in accordance with Table C: 
                  TABLE C. MAXIMUM 
                  TELECOMMUNICATION TOWER HEIGHTS 

                   
                  *Refers to the number of separate entities collocating on the same structure. 
                  C.  Administrative Approval. 
                  1.  The addition of transmitting and/or receiving whip antennas and panels may be approved administratively by the Planning and Zoning Director, so long as any such addition does not add more than 10 feet in height to an existing structure greater than 50 feet in height or more than 5 feet in height to an existing structure less than 50 feet in height but greater than 20 feet in height and all necessary building permits are obtained. Such acceptable structures include buildings, signs, light poles, water towers, and other free standing nonresidential structures. Antennas attached to existing structures, along with supporting electrical and mechanical equipment, shall be of a color identical to, or closely compatible with, that of the supporting structure. Notification shall be given to Board of Commissioners at least 10 days prior to the granting of said request, and if no objection is lodged, considered valid. 
                  2.  The Planning and Zoning Director may administratively approve alternative mounting structures such as fake trees, clock towers, bell steeples, light standards, and similar alternative mounting structures, provided such alternative structure is determined by the Director to satisfy such factors set forth in subsection A. These structures shall also be exempt from the additional separation and setback requirements pertaining to towers. Notification shall be given to Board of Commissioners at least 10 days prior to the granting of said request, and if no objection is lodged, considered valid. 
                  3.  The Planning and Zoning Director may administratively approve the shared use of an existing tower or structure by another provider, including the placement of additional accessory buildings or other supporting equipment. The Director may administratively waive district setback requirements by up to 50% to accommodate the placement of such additional buildings or other supporting equipment in order to encourage the shared use of existing infrastructure. 
                  4.  The addition of antennas to an existing structure are exempted from all setback requirements which pertain to residentially zoned or used properties. 
                  D.  Removal of Antennas and/or Towers. All towers shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such towers. If upon inspection by the Department of Public Works such tower is determined not to comply with the code standards and to constitute a danger to persons or property, then upon written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance. The owner of the tower may appeal the determination by the Department of Public Works by filing a written appeal to the County Manager within 10 days of the receipt of the notice of noncompliance by the owner. The County Manager shall hold a hearing within 5 days of receiving said written appeal. In the event such tower is not brought into compliance within 30 days, the County may petition the municipal court for an order removing such antenna and/or tower and may petition the court for a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. 
                  E.  Exceptions. 
                  1.  Antennas or towers located on publicly owned property or owned by governmental bodies shall be exempt from the requirements of this ordinance, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the appropriate governing body. 
                  2.  A tower under 70 feet in height owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator shall be exempted from these requirements. However, the owner or operator of such tower shall be required to comply with all applicable local, state and federal codes. 
                  3.  Any existing or previously approved tower or antenna shall be considered "grandfathered" and will not be required to meet any additional requirements of this ordinance other than those in place prior.

                  DIVISION 714. - SIGNS 

                  Sec. 714.01. - Purpose. 
                  These standards are intended to: 
                  A.  Safeguard life, public health, aesthetic quality and welfare by regulating the location, size, number, illumination, construction, maintenance and quality of materials of all signs and outdoor advertising structures and to eliminate visual clutter and blight within the County 
                  B.  Promote the safety of persons and property by providing that signs do not create traffic or other hazards due to collapse, fire, visual obstruction, decay or abandonment.

                  The following requirements and limitations shall apply with regard to signs, in addition to provisions appearing elsewhere in the text of these regulations or in the schedule of zoning district regulations. 
                  A.  Any property owner, tenant, agent, or contractor must obtain a permit from the Department of Planning and Zoning prior to the erection, replacement, reconstruction, or relocation of a sign. Said permit shall be required for all signs except those specifically exempted within this ordinance. If the sign is erected by the tenant, the tenant must have a current license to do business in the County at the location where the erection, replacement, reconstruction, or relocation is to take place. Agents or contractors actively erecting or maintaining signs must have a license to do business in the County. 
                  B.  Each application for a sign permit shall contain the following information:

All such variances must be based upon the evidence submitted before the Planning Commission and upon its findings, supported by the testimony or by documentary testimony that such variance shall be required by one of the following causes:
