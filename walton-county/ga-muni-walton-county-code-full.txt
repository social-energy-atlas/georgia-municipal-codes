PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Walton County, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indices 
The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indices themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Code Attorney, and William B. Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to the county staff, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the board to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments.

(5)  To encourage and promote the expansion and development of industrial and commercial facilities in Walton County so as to relieve insofar as possible unemployment within its boundaries, and to that end to acquire by purchase or gift any building or structure within the limits of Walton County, suitable for and intended for use as a factory, mill, shop, processing plant, assembly plant, or fabricating plant, including all necessary and appurtenant land and appurtenances thereto, and all necessary or useful furnishings, machinery and equipment. Such acquisition may be through the acquisition of land and the construction thereon of a building, including the demolition of existing structures, or through the acquisition of an existing building and the remodeling, renovating, reconstructing, furnishing and equipping of such building;

L. 1937, p. 761) as amended, Ga. Code Ann. Supp. Chapter 87-8, as if said obligations had been originally authorized to be issued thereunder; provided, however, that any property, real or personal, of the Authority may be pledged, mortgaged, conveyed, assigned, hypothecated or otherwise encumbered as security for any lawful debt of the Authority. The Authority may execute any trust agreement or indenture not in conflict with the provisions of this amendment to provide security for any bonds issued as provided herein, and such trust agreement or indenture may provide for foreclosure or forced sale of any property of the Authority upon default on such bonds either in payment of principal or interest or under any term or condition under which such bonds are issued.

H.  The Authority may authorize additional bonds, for extensions and permanent improvements to any industrial building acquired herein, to be placed in escrow and to be negotiated from time to time as proceeds for that purpose may become necessary. Bonds so placed in escrow shall, when sold and delivered, have such standing with the bonds of the same issue as may be provided in the authorizing proceedings.

L.  This amendment is adopted for the purpose of promoting and expanding for the public good and welfare industry and trade within Walton County and reducing unemployment to the greatest extent possible, and this amendment and any law enacted with reference to the Authority shall be liberally construed for the accomplishment of these purposes. 
M.  This amendment shall be effective immediately upon proclamation of its ratification by the Governor and the first members of the Authority shall be appointed within thirty (30) days after such proclamation. 
N.  The General Assembly may by law further define and prescribe the powers and duties of the Authority and the exercise thereof, and may enlarge and restrict the same, and may likewise, further regulate the management and conduct of the Authority. The Authority shall be an instrumentality of Walton County and the scope of its operations shall be limited to the territory embraced within said county. The General Assembly shall not extend the jurisdiction of the Authority nor the scope of its operations beyond such limits.

ARTICLE VI. - WATER AND SEWERAGE AUTHORITY[10] 

Footnotes: 
--- (10) --- 
Editor's note— Printed herein is 1972 Ga. Laws, page 3623, which created the Walnutgrove-Youth Water Authority. Pursuant to 1988 Ga. Laws, page 4105, the name of the authority was changed to Walton County Water and Sewerage Authority. Amendments to the act are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 

Section 1. - Short title. 
This shall be known and may be cited as the Walton County Water and Sewerage Authority Act. 
Section 1.1. - Reconstitution. 
The General Assembly finds that it is advantageous to reconstitute the Walton County Water and Sewerage Authority for the following reasons: 
(1)  The exceptionally rapid growth of the county requires careful planning for infrastructure, which would be made easier by reconstituting the authority; 
(2)  The planning and construction of a reservoir designed to fulfill the county's water needs for the next several decades inaugurates a new era for the county and the authority, and renders obsolete the election of three members of the authority by users of the authority's facilities, since it is now more important that the members of the authority represent the entire county; 
(3)  The appointment of three members of the authority by the governing authorities of the City of Monroe, the City of Loganville, and the City of Social Circle is also obsolete, since these cities manage their own water and sewer systems; and 
(4)  Close coordination of expansion of the sewerage system with planning for commercial and business development would be more feasible with a reconstituted authority. 
(2005 Ga. Laws, Act. No. 41 (S.B. 333), § 1) 
Section 2. - Walton County Water and Sewerage Authority. 
(a)  This Act continues the existence of a body corporate and politic, known as the Walton County Water and Sewerage Authority, which is deemed to be a political subdivision of the State of Georgia and a public corporation and by that name, style, and title said body may contract and be contracted with, sue and be sued, implead and be impleaded, and complain and defend in all court of law and equity. 
(b)  The terms of members of the authority appointed under the provisions of prior law and serving on the authority on the effective date of this Act shall terminate at noon on the effective date of this Act. On and after 12:01 P.M. of the effective date of this Act, the authority shall consist of seven members appointed by the Board of Commissioners of Walton County, one of such members appointed by each district commissioner and one of such members appointed by the chairperson of the board of commissioners. 
(c)  Each member of the authority shall be a resident of Walton County and shall live within the service area of the authority. Members of the authority shall be appointed for terms of one year and until their successors are appointed and qualified. Members of the authority shall serve at the will and pleasure of the Board of Commissioners of Walton County. Any member of the authority may be appointed to succeed himself or herself. 
(d)  The members of the authority shall elect one of their number as chairperson. Four members shall constitute a quorum. No vacancy on the authority shall impair the right of the quorum to exercise all the rights and perform all the duties of the authority. The authority shall meet at least annually in the month of January of each year and at such other times as the authority may deem necessary. 
(e)  In the event of a vacancy on the authority for any reason, a replacement member to complete the unexpired term shall be appointed in the same manner as the member whose absence created the vacancy. 
(f)  The members of the authority shall be compensated in the amount of $75.00 for each meeting of the authority attended by a member. All compensation shall be from funds available to the authority. 
(g)  The authority shall have perpetual existence. The authority as reconstituted by this Act continues in existence the authority created by the 1972 Act, despite the changes in name and membership.

The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates per annum, payable at such time or times, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their date or dates, shall be payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the Authority, and may be redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Authority in the resolution providing for the issuance of bonds.

The Authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of the principal thereof and the interest thereon, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the State. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form, or both, as the Authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest. 
Section 7. - Same; signatures; seal. 
In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if such officer had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the Authority and official seal of the Authority shall be affixed thereto and attested by the secretary and treasurer of the Authority and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of the chairman and secretary and treasurer of the Authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signatures of such persons and any bond may be signed, sealed and attested on behalf of the Authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bonds such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. 
Section 8. - Same; negotiability; exemption from taxation. 
All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the laws of the State. Such bonds, their transfer and the income thereof shall be exempt from all taxation within the State. 
Section 9. - Same; sale; proceeds. 
The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the Authority and the proceeds derived from the sale of such bonds shall be used solely for the purpose provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds.

Any resolution, providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular, special, or adjourned meeting of the Authority by a majority of its members. 
Section 13. - Credit not pledged. 
Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of any county or municipality nor a pledge of the faith and credit of any county or municipality, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly or contingently obligate any county or municipality to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this Section. 
Section 14. - Trust indenture as security. 
In the discretion of the Authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the State. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the Authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insuring of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the Authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
Section 15. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
The Authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolutions or trust indentures may provide. 
Section 16. - Sinking fund. 
The revenues, fees, tolls and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the Authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the Authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund, which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest and other investment charges, and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture any surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued. 
Section 17. - Remedies of bondholders. 
Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the Authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished.

The issuance of such funding or refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the Authority in respect to the same shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this Act insofar as the same may be applicable. 
Section 19. - Validation. 
Bonds of the Authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of the Revenue Bond Law, as amended. The petition for validation shall also make party defendant to such action the State of Georgia or any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision or instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the Authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated and the State or such municipality, county, authority, political subdivision or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any exist, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the contract or contracts adjudicated as a part of the basis of the security for the payment of any such bonds of the Authority. The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon and against the Authority issuing the same, and the State and any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision or instrumentality, if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the said Walton County Water and Sewerage Authority. 
Section 20. - Venue and jurisdiction. 
Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any suit or action against such Authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Walton County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to the validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall likewise be brought in said court, which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions. 
Section 21. - Interests of bondholders protected. 
While any of the bonds issued by the Authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties or existence of said Authority or of its officers, employees or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will adversely affect the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds. The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the Authority and the holders of any such bonds. 
Section 22. - Moneys received considered trust funds. 
All moneys received pursuant to the authority of this Act, whether as proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, as grants or other contributions, or as revenues, income, fees or earnings, shall be deemed to be trust funds to be held and applied solely as provided in this Act. 
Section 23. - Rates, charges and revenues; use. 
The Authority is hereby authorized to prescribe and fix rates and to revise same from time to time and to collect fees, tolls and charges for the services, facilities and commodities furnished, and in anticipation of the collection of the revenues of such undertaking or project, to issue revenue bonds as herein provided to finance, in whole or in part, the cost of the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, betterment or extension of a water system, and to pledge to the punctual payment of said bonds and interest thereon, all or any part of the revenues of such undertaking or project, including the revenues of improvements, betterments or extensions thereto thereafter made.

It shall be the duty of the Authority to prescribe rules and regulations for the operation of the project or projects constructed under the provisions of this Act, including the basis on which water service and facilities shall be furnished. 
Section 25. - Tort immunity. 
The Authority shall have the same immunity and exemption from liability for torts and negligence as Walton County; and the officers, agents and employees of the Authority, when in the performance of the work of the Authority, shall have the same immunity and exemption from liability for torts and negligence as the officers, agents and employees of Walton County when in performance of their public duties or work of the County. 
Section 26. - Powers declared supplemental and additional. 
The foregoing Sections of this Act shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the doing of the things authorized thereby and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws, and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing. This Act does not in any way take from Walton County or any municipality located therein or any adjoining county the authority to own, operate and maintain a water system or to issue revenue bonds as is provided by the Revenue Bond Law. 
Section 27. - Liberal construction of act. 
This Act, being for the welfare of various political subdivisions of the State and its inhabitants, shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes hereof.

The General Assembly hereby declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this Act if it had known that such part or parts hereof would be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional.

Sec. 2-81. - Findings. 
(a)  Establishment. The board of commissioners by resolution duly adopted in an official meeting of such body on December 1, 1981, did create and establish the development authority of the county under the Development Authorities Law of Georgia, now codified as O.C.G.A. § 36-62-1 et seq., establishing its initial board of directors, their terms and manner of appointment. 
(b)  Ex officio positions. The board of commissioners in an official meeting of such body on February 1, 1994, took action to create ex officio positions on the board of directors of the development authority of the county for the mayors of Monroe, Social Circle and Loganville, and the president of the Walton County Chamber of Commerce, and related matters. 
(c)  Change of title. The board of commissioners by resolution duly adopted in an official meeting of such body on March 7, 1995, changing the ex officio position on the board of directors of the development authority of the county from the "president" to the "chairman" of the Walton County Chamber of Commerce due to a change in the corporate structure of the chamber. 
(d)  Membership change. The board of commissioners by resolution duly adopted in an official meeting of such body on November 7, 1995, changed the membership of the board of directors of the development authority of the county from seven to nine members and thereafter appointed a member of the board of commissioners to fill one of the additional seats as an ex officio position, but due to an apparent typographical error in such resolution, it was necessary to adopt a corrective resolution on the same subject in an official meeting of the board of commissioners on January 7, 1997. 
(e)  Current composition. The current composition of the board of directors of the development authority of the county serve by appointment of the county board of commissioners. 
(f)  Logansville representative. The county board of commissioners in its meeting on July 10, 2001, was requested by the mayor and council of the City of Loganville to appoint a representative of their body, other than the mayor, and Councilman Wendell H. Geiger was suggested to represent that body on the development authority of the county, such appointment not being currently consistent with the existing resolutions related thereto. 
(g)  Consolidation and clarification of previous resolutions. In order to create greater flexibility in the appointments to the board of directors of the development authority of the county and to more clearly define the terms of such directors, the board of commissioners has determined that it is desirable and appropriate to adopt a new resolution that consolidates and clarifies previous resolutions on this matter. 
(Res. No. 2001-29, 8-7-2001) 
Sec. 2-82. - Restatement, revision and modification of previous resolutions and actions. 
Previous resolutions and actions of the county regarding the manner and terms of appointment to the board of directors of the development authority of the county are restated, revised and modified so that henceforth the composition of such board of directors shall be as follows: 
(1)  The board of directors of the development authority of the county shall consist of nine members, all of whom shall be appointed by the board of commissioners of the county periodically for variable terms as hereafter provided. As mandated by O.C.G.A. § 36-62-5, the board of directors of the development authority shall be taxpayers residing in the county. 
(2)  One representative each shall be appointed annually from the elected officials of the City of Monroe, City of Social Circle, and the City of Loganville for a one-year term as ex officio members of the county development authority, who shall be the mayors of such cities as representatives on the authority of their respective governmental bodies; and if for any reason a mayor shall be ineligible or declines to serve in such capacity, the board of commissioners may appoint a member of that city council for the one-year term as the representative on the authority board for such city. Such appointments shall be on a calendar year basis and made at the first meeting of the board of commissioners each year. 
(3)  One representative shall be appointed annually from the board of directors of the Walton County Chamber of Commerce for a one-year term as an ex officio member of the Authority, who shall be the chairman of the board of directors of the chamber; and if for any reason the chairman shall be ineligible or declines to serve in such capacity, the board of commissioners may appoint another member of the board of directors for the one-year term as the representative of such organization on the county development authority. Such appointment shall be on a calendar year basis and made at the first meeting of the board of commissioners each year. 
(4)  One representative shall be appointed annually from the board of commissioners for a one-year term as an ex officio member of the county development authority. Such appointment shall be on a calendar year basis and made at the first meeting of the board of commissioners each year. 
(5)  The remaining four positions on the board of directors of the county development authority shall be appointed by the board of commissioners for terms beginning on December 1, 2001, initially for staggered terms of one, two, three and four years each, ending on November 30, 2002, November 30, 2003, November 30, 2004, and November 30, 2005, respectively. Thereafter, the appointments for each of these positions shall be for a term of four years each. 
(6)  If, at the end of any term of office of any director, a successor thereto has not been elected, the director whose term of office has expired shall continue to hold office until his successor is so elected.

(Ord. of 12-1-15) 
Sec. 2-134. - Application of federal and state law. 
It is intended that this division shall conform to all applicable provisions of the laws of the United States and of the State of Georgia, and the provisions hereof shall be so construed wherever possible. In the event any portion of this division shall be declared invalid for its failure to conform to state or federal law, such invalidity shall not affect the remaining portions hereof. Notwithstanding any other provision of this division to the contrary, the county may enter into any contract, follow any procedure, or take any action that is necessary or convenient for receiving funds from the government of the United States or the State of Georgia. 
(Ord. of 12-1-15) 
Sec. 2-135. - Ethical considerations. 
It is the policy of Walton County to seek the best overall value when procuring goods and services. Toward this end, the county finds and declares that its objectives will best be achieved generally through an open, competitive process with a broad range of responsible vendors wishing to furnish products and services to the county. 
Walton County declares that county employees and officials, along with those wishing to do business with the county, have the shared responsibility for avoiding biased, anticompetitive or unethical practices. 
Walton County employees, officials and their family members are generally prohibited from seeking, requesting, or receiving any material payment, gift or promise of future benefit or any other thing of value when such receipt has the potential to influence a procurement decision or to gain undue advantage in a procurement competition. 
Walton County employees, officers and appointees (or their immediate family members) shall not sell personal or real property to the county or any of its agencies, unless said sale amounts to less than $800.00 per calendar quarter or unless such sale is made pursuant to sealed competitive bids made by the employee either individually or on behalf of a business entity. Furthermore, county employees (or their immediate family members) either directly or through a business entity owned or controlled by them should not perform services for the county in addition to their regular paid position unless such services are rendered pursuant to a written contract which is placed on the minutes of the board of commissioners. Any such contract must be reviewed by the board of commissioners on an annual basis. 
It is unethical for any county employee or official to purchase commodities or services from a county contract for personal use. 
Individuals, firms and businesses seeking an award of a contract may not initiate or continue any verbal or written communications regarding a solicitation with any county officer, elected official, employee or other representative other than the purchasing department associate named in the solicitation between the date of the issuance of the solicitation and the date of the final contract award by the board of commissioners. Any such communication shall be reviewed by the purchasing manager and, if the purchasing manager determines in his or her sole discretion that the communication at issue has compromised the competitive process, the offer submitted by the individual, firm or business may be disqualified. 
Commodities or services shall not be purchased from a vendor who is delinquent or in default on the payment of any taxes or other monies due Walton County, or any other county, municipality, or state or the federal government. Vendors from whom the county desires to purchase commodities or services shall be required to execute an affidavit, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 1, stating that they are not delinquent or in default on the payment of any taxes or other monies due Walton County, or any other county, municipality, or state or the federal government ("vendor affidavit"); however, the vendor affidavit shall not be required for emergency purchases. The vendor affidavit shall be included with the documents made available in connection with all invitations to bid and requests for proposals disseminated pursuant to part 3, section 2-151(a) of this division. In the event it is discovered that a vendor is delinquent or in default on the payment of any taxes or other monies due Walton County, or any other county, municipality, or state or the federal government, the county may terminate any contract with such vendor and place the vendor on the Ineligible Source List as provided herein.

It is the responsibility of each elected official or department director to ensure all purchases made for or by his or her agency or department are consistent with and support the current approved budget prior to committing funds.

The purchasing manager shall, except as otherwise specified herein, be responsible for the administration of all transactions governed by the provisions of this division and shall serve as the principal procurement officer of the county. Unless otherwise provided, any duties and powers of the purchasing manager may be delegated by him or her to subordinate purchasing department employees or other individuals within county departments and agencies that have demonstrated adequate knowledge and understanding of this division. In the event the purchasing manager delegates any of his or her duties or powers to an individual outside the purchasing department pursuant to the provisions hereof, that county department or agency with whom that individual is affiliated shall be responsible for maintaining all documentation related to purchases made pursuant to such delegated authority. 
(Ord. of 12-1-15)

The purchasing manager is authorized to establish, implement and enforce written operational procedures relating to acquisitions subject to this division.

Secs. 2-145—2-150. - Reserved. 
Part 3. - Procurement Methods 

Sec. 2-151. - General procurement procedures. 
(a)  Purchases greater than $50,000.00. 
(1)  Competitive sealed bidding . Except as otherwise provided herein, for purchases where either (i) the costs of materials, supplies, equipment, services or project is expected to be greater than $50,000.00 or (ii) revenue is expected to be greater than $50,000.00, competitive sealed bidding is the preferred method of procurement and should be used whenever possible, as it allows qualified, responsive bidders to compete on the basis of price. Generally, the following conditions are required for competitive sealed bidding: 
1.  Clear and adequate specifications are available; and 
2.  Two or more responsible bidders are willing to participate in the process. 
a.  Dissemination of invitation to bid. Public notice of an invitation to bid shall be advertised as required by Georgia law to the extent applicable. The public notice shall contain a general description of the purchase, shall state the location where documents may be obtained and the date, time and place of bid opening. Notice of any required bonding and insurance shall be included in the public notice. A copy of such notice shall be advertised online and by the front door of the Walton County Courthouse. Any other methods of advertisement identified as likely to result in additional competition may be used in addition to the required advertisement, at the discretion of the purchasing manager. 
b.  Receipt of bid. No written bid shall be eligible for consideration by the county unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the purchasing department by the date and time specified in the invitation to bid. All bids shall be stamped or annotated with the date and time of receipt and secured until the designated opening time. A bid delivered late shall not be considered by the county. 
c.  Bid opening . Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses on the date and at the time and place designated in the invitation to bid. The name of each bidder, the purchase price contained in each bid and such other information as the purchasing manager deems appropriate shall be announced as the bids are opened. A record of bid information shall be recorded and available for public inspection. 
d.  Modification of bid. Any clerical mistake that is patently obvious on the face of a bid, subject to the limitations described below may be corrected if the purchasing manager determines the correction to be in the county's best interest. Omissions affecting or relating to price information or any required bonding shall be deemed material and may not be corrected after bid opening. 
e.  Withdrawal of bid. Bids may be withdrawn at any time prior to the bid opening. After bids have been publicly opened, a bid may be withdrawn only in accordance with the following procedures: 
• The bidder shall give notice in writing of his or her intent to withdraw his or her bid due to an error within two business days after the conclusion of the bid opening procedure. 
• A bid may be withdrawn from consideration if the price was substantially lower than the other bids due solely to a mistake therein, provided the bid was submitted in good faith, and the mistake was a clerical mistake as opposed to a judgment mistake, and was actually due to an unintentional arithmetic error or an unintentional omission of a quantity of work, labor or material made directly in the compilation of the bid, which unintentional arithmetic error or unintentional omission can be clearly shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of the original work papers, documents and materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to be withdrawn. 
• The bidder's original work papers shall be the sole acceptable evidence of error and mistake if a request is made to withdraw the bid. 
• If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this provision, the lowest remaining responsive bid shall be deemed to be the low bid. 
f.  Bid cancellation. An invitation to bid may be canceled prior to opening date. Thereafter, any or all bids may be rejected in whole or in part when it is in the best interest of the county. 
g.  Bid evaluation. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation to bid. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that is not specifically set forth in the invitation to bid. 
h.  Bid award. Subject to approval by the Walton County Board of Commissioners, bid(s) shall be awarded to the responsible bidder(s) who have submitted the lowest cost responsive bid(s), highest revenue responsive bid(s), or whose bid(s) represent the best value to the county. 
The purchasing manager may reject bids or may defer bid awards to allow time for additional evaluation or review, consistent with the best interest of the county. 
The following types of bids shall be disqualified for consideration for a bid award: (i) a bid which is incomplete in any material aspect, element or fact; (ii) a bid submitted without required bonds; (iii) a bid submitted by an individual, firm or business on the ineligible source list; and (iv) a bid submitted by a person in violation of the ethical requirements of this division. 
In the event two responsive bids are tied for the lowest price and the other terms and conditions of the two are substantially the same, the bid shall be awarded to the local firm if only one of the bidders has its principal place of business in Walton County. If both or neither of the tied bidders are local firms, then the bid award shall be made to the winner of a coin toss by purchasing department staff in a public session where bidders will be invited to attend and one or more witnesses may be present. 
Prices received through the bid process shall be in effect for 60 days after the bid opening. If a second purchase is needed within six months of the bid opening, it is not necessary to re-bid for the second purchase provided the bid price does not change. 
(2)  Competitive sealed proposal method. When use of competitive sealed bidding is either impractical or not advantageous to the county for a purchase where either (i) the costs of materials, supplies, equipment, services or project is expected to be greater than $50,000.00 or (ii) revenue is expected to be greater than $50,000.00, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposal method. The following factors may be considered in determining whether to use the competitive sealed proposal method: 
1.  Whether quality, availability or capability is overriding in relation to price in procurement of technical supplies or technical or professional services; 
2.  Whether the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with subsequent maintenance and service capabilities and what priorities should be given these requirements in the county's best interest; 
3.  Whether fixed price or cost type contract is more advantageous; and 
4.  Whether the market place will respond better to a solicitation permitting not only a range of alternate proposals, but evaluation and discussion of them before making the award. 
a.  Dissemination of request for proposal. Public notice of a request for proposal shall be advertised as required by Georgia law to the extent applicable. The public notice shall contain a general description of the purchase, shall state the location where documents may be obtained and the date, time and place of proposal opening. Notice of any required bonding and insurance shall be included in the public notice. A copy of such notice shall be advertised online and by the front door of the Walton County Courthouse. Any other methods of advertisement identified as likely to result in additional competition may be used in addition to the required advertisement, at the discretion of the purchasing manager. 
b.  Receipt of proposal . No written proposal shall be eligible for consideration by the county unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the purchasing department by the date and time specified in the request for proposal. All proposals shall be stamped or annotated with the date and time of receipt and secured until the designated opening time. A proposal delivered late shall not be considered by the county. 
c.  Proposal opening. Proposals shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses on the date and at the time and place designated in the request for proposal. Only the name of the person submitting the proposal shall be announced. 
d.  Proposal cancellation. A request for proposal may be canceled prior to opening date. Thereafter, any or all proposals may be rejected in whole or in part when it is in the best interest of the county. 
e.  Proprietary information. Information submitted with a proposal that is specifically marked "proprietary" shall not be disclosed outside of the purchasing department without prior notification to the person submitting the proposal. Walton County is required to comply with the Georgia Open Records Act, O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 and therefore may not be able to protect information submitted with a proposal. Entire proposals may not be deemed "proprietary." 
f.  Proposal evaluation. Each proposal shall be evaluated to determine whether it is responsive to the specifications and other terms and conditions contained in the request for proposal. The evaluating team may communicate with anyone who submitted a proposal in order to clarify a proposal. No information concerning a proposal shall be communicated in any way to anyone other than the person who submitted the proposal. Additional information may be requested from anyone who submitted a proposal. 
g.  Proposal award. Subject to approval by the Walton County Board of Commissioners, award shall be made to the responsive and responsible person whose proposal is determined to be the most advantageous to the county based upon the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal. 
The purchasing manager may reject proposals or may defer proposal awards to allow time for additional evaluation or review, consistent with the best interest of the county. 
The following types of proposals shall be disqualified for consideration of award: (i) a proposal which is incomplete in any material aspect, element or fact; (ii) a proposal submitted without required bonds; (iii) a proposal submitted by an individual, firm or business on the ineligible source list; and (iv) a proposal submitted by a person in violation of ethical requirements of this division. 
(b)  Purchases of $50,000.00 or less. Purchases of $50,000.00 or less are considered informal purchases and do not justify the administrative time and expense of competitive sealed bidding or the competitive sealed proposal method; however, the processes used for this type of procurement shall include as much competition as is consistent with the anticipated cost of the procurement and the best interest of the county. The purchasing manager is authorized to establish the methods and procedures to be used in handling informal purchases. Unless otherwise specifically provided, such purchases shall be obtained competitively through telephone quotations or informal written solicitations. Purchases may not be artificially divided as to constitute an informal purchase, thereby circumventing the dollar limit requirement for competitive sealed bidding or the competitive sealed proposal method. 
Each county department is granted the authority, at the discretion of the department director, to handle purchases of commodities and services where the cost does not exceed $1,000.00. These purchases may be made by use of a payment voucher. Such purchases may be reviewed for compliance by the purchasing manager, and departmental authority may be revoked for misuse and violation of procedures. 
Each county department is granted the authority, at the discretion of the department director, to obtain pricing for commodities and services where the cost is more than $1,000.00, but not more than $50,000.00. These purchases may be made by use of a purchaser order. For purchases of commodities totaling more than $1,000.00, but less than $5,000.00, the county department must obtain a minimum of three oral quotes, unless adequate source supply is not available, and the approval of the purchasing manager. For purchases of commodities totaling $5,000.00 or more, the county department must obtain a minimum of three written quotes, unless adequate source supply is not available, and the approval of the purchasing manager and the Walton County Board of Commissioners.

Sec. 6-42. - Bring your own bottle "brown bagging" prohibited. 
It is prohibited for any person to bring in his own alcoholic beverage (brown bag) in any establishment either licensed or unlicensed to serve alcoholic beverages. 
(Ord. of 12-1-2009) 
Sec. 6-43. - Types of entertainment, attire and conduct prohibited. 
(a)  Preamble and purpose: 
(1)  Based upon the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas; Amarillo, Texas; St. Paul, Minnesota; Indianapolis, Indiana; Phoenix, Arizona; El Paso, Texas; Newport News, Virginia; St Mary's, Georgia; Toledo, Ohio; Fort Worth, Texas and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; (as outlined also in the adult entertainment ordinance) which experiences the board of commissioners believes are relevant to the problems faced by the county and based upon the evidence and testimony of the citizens and experts who have appeared before such bodies, the board of commissioners takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. 
(2)  Moreover, it is the finding of the board of commissioners that public nudity and seminudity, under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances relating to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment," "adult entertainment," or "erotic entertainment" begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude or seminude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity or seminudity. 
(b)  Any establishment licensed under the provisions of this chapter is prohibited from permitting or engaging in the following activities: 
(1)  The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or of any portion of the pubic hair, anus, cleft of the buttocks, vulva or genitals; or 
(2)  Live entertainment, which provides or features nude or seminude or erotic dancing, or the performance of obscene acts or acts, which simulate: 
a.  Sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation or any sexual acts which are prohibited by law or: 
b.  The touching, caressing or fondling of the breast, buttock, anus or genitals; or 
c.  The displaying of the pubic hair, anus, vulva or genitals; or 
(3)  The showing of any film, still pictures, electronic reproduction or other visual reproductions depicting any of the acts described in subsection (2) above which are obscene under state law; or 
(4)  The holding, promotion or allowance of any contest, promotion, special night or any other activity where patrons of the licensed establishment are encouraged or allowed to engage in any of the above-prohibited conduct. 
(c)  Mainstream activity excluded. Notwithstanding the prohibitions in subsection (b) above, nothing in this chapter shall or is intended to apply to theatrical or motion picture performance houses, museums, or the like where the consumption or service of alcohol is not a primary purpose or mainstream activity of such establishment.

Employee means an individual whose work is performed under the direction and supervision of an employer who withholds FICA, federal income tax, or state income tax from such individual's compensation or issues to such individual for purposes of documenting compensation a form I.R.S.

The site of real property which is rented or leased to another does not constitute a location or office for the real property's owner, lessor, or the agent of the owner or lessor unless the real property's owner, lessor, or the agent of the owner or lessor, in addition to showing the property to prospective lessees or tenants and performing maintenance or repair of the property, otherwise conducts the business of renting or leasing the real property at such site or otherwise conducts any other business, profession, or occupation at such site.

(Ord. of 7-1-14, § 1) 
Sec. 18-32. - Purpose and scope of tax. 
The occupation tax levied herein is not for regulatory purposes, but rather revenue purposes only. Occupation tax payment is not a condition precedent for transacting business or practicing a profession or occupation in the unincorporated part of the county.

(e)  A business or practitioner that is subject to occupation tax by more than one local government in Georgia shall only be subject to occupation tax by the county for the number of employees who are employed within the unincorporated part of the county.

ARTICLE VI. - PAIN MANAGEMENT CLINICS 

Sec. 18-163. - Findings; public purpose; legal authority. 
(a)  Based upon the experience of other municipalities, counties and states, which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems potentially faced by Walton County, Georgia, we take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the indiscriminate dispensing of massive amounts of powerful prescription drugs by unconventional pain clinics, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Illegal pain management clinics commonly known as "pill mills" dispense large quantities of Schedule II, III and IV drugs for cash, with little examination of the patient conducted. Moreover, it is the finding of the Walton County Board of Commissioners that the indiscriminate dispensing of massive amounts of powerful prescription drugs by unconventional pain clinics begets criminal behavior, tends to create an undesirable community, and constitutes a danger to the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Walton County. Among the undesirable community conditions identified are drug addiction, drug overdoses, drug abuse, the illicit use of pharmaceutical drugs and other associated illegal activities. The Walton County Board of Commissioners finds that such conditions increase expenditure for the allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increase the burden on the judicial system as a consequence hereof, and lead to a potentially dangerous condition for the citizens of Walton County. Therefore, this article is established to ensure that anyone dispensing or prescribing drugs within the unincorporated portions of Walton County is doing so in compliance with local, state and federal law. Preliminary information will be gathered from pain management clinics prior to the issuance of an occupation tax certificate. This article is created in the interest of public welfare and as a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the negative impact on Walton County as set forth herein. 
(b)  This article is adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. Title 48, Chapter 13. 
(c)  This article is further adopted to protect the public safety, health and welfare of the citizens of Walton County. 
(d)  This article is further adopted pursuant to the police power of Walton County.

(c)  Method of calculation. 
(1)  Any development impact fee imposed pursuant to this ordinance shall not exceed a project's proportionate share of the cost of system improvements, shall be calculated on the basis of the establishment of service areas, and shall be calculated on the basis of levels of service for public facilities that are the same for existing development as for new growth and development, as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
(2)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this ordinance, the calculation of impact fees shall be net of the present value of ad valorem tax or other revenues such revenues shall be as established in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan, and are those which: 
a.  Are reasonably expected to be generated by new development; and 
b.  Are reasonably expected on the basis of historical funding patterns to be made available to pay for system improvements of the same category and in the same service area for which an impact fee is imposed. 
(3)  The method of calculating impact fees for public facilities under this ordinance shall be maintained for public inspection as a part of the official records of Walton County, Georgia, and may be amended from time to time by official act. 
(4)  In addition to the cost of new or expanded system improvements needed to be built to serve new development, the cost basis of a development impact fee shall also include the proportionate cost of existing system improvements to the extent that such public facilities have excess service capacity and new development will be served by such facilities. 
(5)  Development impact fees shall be based on actual system improvement costs or reasonable estimates of such costs, as set forth in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. of 3-1-2005, § 4) 
Sec. 26-55. - Fee assessment and payment. 
(a)  Fee schedule. 
(1)  Payment of a development impact fee pursuant to section 26-65, fee schedule, for a property located inside of Walton County, shall constitute full and complete payment of the project's proportionate share of system improvements and shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this ordinance. 
(2)  When a land development activity for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two or more buildings, structures or other land uses in any combination, including two or more uses within a building or structure, the total development impact fee shall be the sum of the fees for each and every building, structure, or use, including each and every use within a building or structure. 
(3)  In the event that an applicant contends that the land use category of the proposed development is not shown on the fee schedule or fits within a different category, then: 
a.  The administrator in his or her sole discretion shall make a determination as to the appropriate land use designation and the appropriate development impact fee. 
b.  In making such determination, the administrator may require such additional information from the applicant as necessary to form a logical fee determination relative to the impact fees shown on the adopted fee schedule.

(1)  Development impact fees shall be assessed at the time of application for a building permit. 
(2)  All development impact fees shall be collected no later than the time of issuance of a building permit. 
(3)  For projects not involving issuance of a building permit, all development impact fees shall be collected at the time of approval of the development permit or such other authorization to commence construction or to commence use of a property. 
(4)  If the final use of a building cannot be determined at the time of the initial building permit, the administrator shall have the authority to assess a development impact fee based on the most likely use of the building, and shall adjust the fee in accordance with the actual use prior to issuance of an interior finishes permit or approval of a certificate of occupancy. An adjustment may result in a refund to the feepayor or payment of the marginal increase of the adjusted fee over the amount already paid. 
(5)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, any future change in demand for public facilities in excess of the average demand anticipated at the time of issuance of the building permit shall be assessed such additional fee as would otherwise have been due. Future changes in demand may result from a change in the land use category of the occupant of the building or property, the expansion of a building or use on a property that results in an increase in the units of development (as defined herein), or the subsequent discovery of facts unknown or misrepresented at the time of issuance of the building permit. 
(c)  Individual assessment determinations. Individual assessments of development impact fees may be established as follows:

(a)  Credits; restrictions. 
(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (2) below, no credit shall be given for construction, contribution, or dedication of any system improvement or funds for system improvements made before the effective date of this ordinance. 
(2)  If the value of any construction, dedication of land, or contribution of money made by a developer (or his or her predecessor in title or interest) for system improvements that are included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of Walton County Comprehensive Plan, prior to the effective date of this ordinance, is greater than the impact fee that would otherwise have been paid for the project, then the developer shall be entitled to a credit for such excess construction, dedication, or funding.

(3)  In no event shall credit be given for project improvements, or for system improvements not included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan. 
(b)  Granting of credits. 
(1)  Credit shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements, contribution or dedication of land, or payment of money by a developer (or his or her predecessor in title or interest) for system improvements of the same public facilities category and in the same service area for which a development impact fee is imposed, provided that: 
a.  The system improvement is included for impact fee funding in the capital improvements element of [the] Walton County Comprehensive Plan;

c.  The board of commissioners shall have explicitly approved said improvement, contribution, dedication, or payment and the value thereof prior to its construction, dedication, or transfer. 
(2)  The credit allowed pursuant to this section shall not exceed the impact fee due for such system improvement unless a greater credit is allowed under a private agreement executed under the provisions of this ordinance.

(c)  Guidelines for credit valuation. Credits under this section shall be valued using the following guidelines: 
(1)  For the construction of any system improvements by a developer (or his or her predecessor in title or interest) and accepted by the county, the developer must present evidence satisfactory to the administrator of the original cost of the improvement, from which present value may be calculated. 
(2)  For any contribution or dedication of land for system improvements by a developer (or his or her predecessor in title or interest) and accepted by the county, the original value of the land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the validated tax appraisal at the time of dedication, from which present value may be calculated. 
(3)  For any contribution of capital equipment that qualifies as a system improvement by a developer (or his or her predecessor in title or interest) and accepted by the county, the value shall be the original cost to the developer of the capital equipment or the cost that Walton County, Georgia, would normally pay for such equipment, whichever is less. 
(4)  For any contribution of money for system improvements from a developer (or his or her predecessor in title or interest) accepted by the county, the original value of the money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution, from which present value may be calculated. 
(5)  In making a present value calculation, the discount rate used shall be the net of the interest returned on a State of Georgia, AA rated or better municipal bond less average annual inflation, or such other discount rate as the board of commissioners in its sole discretion may deem appropriate.

(1)  Credits shall be given only upon written request of the developer to the administrator. A developer must present written evidence satisfactory to the administrator at or before the time of development impact fee assessment. 
(2)  The administrator, in his or her sole discretion, shall review all claims for credits and make determinations regarding the allowance of any claimed credit, and the value of any allowed credit. 
(3)  Any credit approved by the administrator shall be acknowledged in writing by the administrator and calculated at the time of impact fee assessment. 
(e)  Credits; abandoned building permits. In the event that an impact fee is paid but the building permit is abandoned, credit shall be given for the present value of the impact fee against future impact fees for the same parcel of land, upon submission of adequate evidence to the administrator that an impact fee was received by the county, the amount paid, and that the building permit was abandoned.

3.  All curves and turns in a flume must be: 
a.  Designed so that the impact of users with the walls of the flume does not present a hazard; and 
b.  Banked so that the forces on the bathers keep them safely inside the flume under all foreseeable circumstances of operation. Bathers must not become airborne. 
4.  In curved sections of a flume, the design of the wall of the flume must cause the outward thrust of the body of the bather to be dissipated towards the centerline of the flume. 
5.  All slopes in a flume must be designed so that the speed of the bathers does not reach a point at which a safe equilibrium of dynamic forces cannot be maintained on any curve or turn in the flume. 
6.  In sections of a flume where bathers can stop, provision must be made by design or modification to prevent bathers from falling out of the flume. 
7.  The construction, dimensions and methods of mechanical attachment of a flume must provide a smooth and continuous surface through the entire length of the flume. Any misalignment of joints in a sectional flume must not exceed one-eighth inch. 
8.  The walls of any flume must be designed so that the continuous and combined action of hydrostatic, dynamic and static loads, as well as normal environmental deterioration do not damage the flume bed to the extent of creating a structural failure that presents a hazard of injury to users or that requires frequent patch repairs that may weaken the structural integrity of the flume. 
(f)  Flume exit. 
1.  The exit of any flume must be designed to ensure that bathers enter the falling-entry pool or slide runout at a safe speed and angle of entry.

2.  The flume must be designed with an exit system that provides for safe entry into the falling-entry pool or slide runout with an exit grade for the last ten feet that does not exceed ten percent. Present practices for safe entry include a water backup, a deceleration distance, and body attitude control. Other methods are acceptable as long as safe exit velocities and proper body altitudes are assured under normal use; 
3.  The flume exit must be flush with the vertical wall of the pool at the point of exit and not more than two inches above, nor less than six inches below, the normal operating level of the pool; and 
4.  The distance between: 
a.  The side wall of the pool and that portion of the flume exit nearest the wall must be not less than five feet at the point of exit; 
b.  The centerline of the flume and the centerline of any adjacent flume must not be less than six feet at the point of exit; 
c.  The point of exit and the side of the pool opposite the bathers as they exit, excluding any steps, must not be less than 20 feet if the flume ends above or below the normal operating water level of the pool. 
(h)  Falling-entry pools. 
1.  If a splash pool is used at a water slide, it must be located at the base of the slide. 
2.  Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the water depth in a falling-entry pool at the end of the flume must be a minimum of 3½ feet from the normal operating water level to the floor. This depth must be maintained for distance of not less than 20 feet from the point of exit from the flume or other falling-entry feature, or not less than 30 feet if the point of exit is even with the normal operating water level. The health authority may waive these requirements if a special exit system is used that ensures a safe exit from the flume and safe entry to the falling-entry pool. 
3.  Beyond the area of level floor required above, in the area of the pool opposite the point of exit from the flume or other falling-entry feature, the floor of the falling-entry pool may have a constant slope upward of not more than one foot in seven feet. 
4.  If steps are provided instead of exit ladders or stepholes with handrails, a handrail must be provided at the steps opposite the point of exit from each flume or falling-entry feature. 
a.  Decks. A deck must be provided along the exit side of the falling-entry pool and along one or more of the other sides of the pool. The pump and reservoir must be accessible by a deck not less than three feet wide.

ARTICLE III. - SPEED HUMP PROGRAM 

Sec. 50-51. - Introduction and general standards. 
(1)  Function of the Walton County Speed Hump Program and ordinance. In response to numerous complaints about speeding problems in neighborhoods, the Walton County Public Works Department (the "department") has studied other similar communities and how those communities have addressed residential speeding problems. One popular and cost effective measure is the installation of speed humps. When properly designed and installed, and with strong community support, speed humps are effective at reducing speeds in neighborhoods. After much experimentation and testing, the use of speed humps has been formally endorsed by transportation authorities worldwide. In the United States, a policy on the use of speed humps has been developed by a special committee of the Institute of Transportation Engineers. The following program and ordinance has been established for the citizens of Walton County who want to pursue the installation of speed humps in their neighborhoods. 
(2)  Street classification. Walton County will only consider installation of speed humps on streets classified as local, residential streets with a speed limit of 25 mph. Traffic engineering studies may indicate that speed humps would be unnecessary or unsafe at certain locations. Data obtained from traffic engineering studies of physical and traffic related factors should be used in determining where speed humps are appropriate. A preliminary field investigation performed by the department prior to the traffic study may find that speed humps are not warranted due to existing conditions such as but not limited to horizontal and vertical alignment, sight distance, length and width of roadway. 
(3)  Legal authority. Speed humps shall be placed only by the authority of the board of commissioners in accordance with the authority vested in the board of commissioners by O.C.G.A. §§ 32-4-40 et seq., 36-1-20, 40-6-371. 
(4)  Standardization of application. In keeping with the general recommendation of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), uniformity aids in the recognition and understanding of traffic control devices. 1 Strict adherence to the standards and guidelines outlined in this article will help ensure that any given speed hump installation will be equally recognizable and require the same action on the part of the motorists regardless of where it is encountered. 
(Res. of 12-5-2006, § 1) 
Note— 1 MUTCD, current edition, U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. 
Sec. 50-52. - Program elements. 
(1)  Initial request from community. The process for speed hump installation begins with letter from the community desiring speed humps requesting a traffic study by the department. Such letter (the "initial request") should come from a community representative, homeowners' association, or individual that certifies that the request is on behalf of at least a majority of the lot owners in the subject area (such initial request need not contain signatures of the majority of lot owners; rather the individual submitting the initial request must certify that the request is on behalf of a majority of lot owners). Following receipt of the initial request, the department will perform a preliminary field inspection. If the street, grade and other fixed factors do not meet the necessary requirements for speed humps, the initial request will fail and no further action will be taken. If the street, grade and other fixed factors qualify for the speed hump program, the department will notify the person or persons who submitted the initial request. Then the department shall conduct a traffic study to determine whether the subject street meets the hereinbelow established criteria. 
(1.1)  Speed criteria. Traffic studies must find that a speeding problem exists, based on the standard of an 85th percentile speed of at least five mph over the posted speed limit of 25 mph. 2 The 85th percentile speed is an excellent indicator of street character. 
(a)  Below speed criteria. Since research has determined that speed humps reduce 85th percentile speeds to approximately 28—30 mph, installing humps on streets with an 85th percentile below criteria speed does not meet generally accepted cost/benefit ratios, and is not recommended. Streets with 85th percentile speeds less than 30 mph will not be considered for the speed hump program. 
(b)  Speed criteria. The Walton County Public Works Department recommends limiting the use of speed humps to residential streets where excessive speeding can be documented. Streets with 85th percentile speeds over 35 mph will require a 70 percent approval of the homeowners in the defined service area, via petition as described in subsection 50-52(4). Streets with 85th percentile speeds of 30—35 mph require a 90 percent approval of the homeowners in the defined service area, via petition as described in subsection 50-52(4). 
(c)  Design speed over 25 mph. The application of a speed reduction device which lowers the 85th percentile speed more than 15 mph will tend to create a pronounced "sine wave-type" velocity profile. Such a velocity profile may be inappropriate in regards to traffic safety. Since research has determined that speed humps reduce 85th percentile speeds to approximately 28—30 mph, installing humps on streets with design speed of 45 mph or greater is not recommended. 
(2)  Establishment of a special assessment district. If a street or street section meets or exceeds the speed criteria (set forth in subsection 50-52(1) above) and meets the street classification criteria (set forth in subsection 50-51(2) above), the department will create a special assessment district which will consist of those properties which directly abut the street on which the proposed speed humps will be located and that are located in the immediate vicinity of the proposed speed humps. Properties should be excluded from special assessment district if the department determines (in its experience and discretion) that such properties would receive no, or only a remote, benefit from the proposed speed humps. Properties should not be added to or deleted from special assessment districts in an attempt to alter voting ratios. 
(3)  Speed hump proposal. Department personnel will create a speed hump proposal by planning the placement of speed humps on streets meeting program criteria using the following guidelines 3 : 
(a)  Grade. Speed humps should not be installed on street sections with grades greater than eight percent. 
(b)  Number of humps in a series. Speed humps are not to be used to slow traffic at a given "point," but rather to reinforce a safe speed along a street or street section. For this reason, a single hump is not recommended. Usually, a series of humps should not exceed three-quarters of a mile. If the street or section of street on which the proposed speed humps will be located exceeds one mile, speed humps can be used in conjunction with other traffic calming devices, such as traffic circles, thus reducing the number of speed humps necessary to achieve targeted speed reduction. 
(c)  Spacing. Research indicates that spacing humps between 350 and 500 feet apart is most effective at lowering the 85th percentile speed to the targeted speed range. 
(d)  Location. The first hump in a series should normally be placed in a position where it cannot be approached at high speed from either direction. To achieve this objective, the first hump in a series is typically installed within 100 and 200 feet of a small-radius curve or stop sign. Care should be taken so that humps are not placed in a location that impedes or impairs access to any utility, manhole cover, and/or driveway cuts. 
(4)  Petition for speed humps. Upon request, the department will forward the speed hump proposal, along with petition forms, to the homeowners' representative. Property owners, who are interested in pursuing the installation of speed humps, shall submit to the department a petition cover letter and a petition form. The following rules and requirements, which will be included with the petition forms, help ensure the fairness and integrity of the petition process: 
(a)  The objective of the Walton County Speed Hump Program is to provide a process pursuant to which speed humps are installed on county maintained neighborhood roads, where engineering studies indicate that their use would meet the desired results of reducing neighborhood speeds and their installation is favored by a majority of the property owners in the area. 
(b)  To have speed humps installed in Walton County, a petition must be submitted to the department. All of the property owners in the special assessment district should be contacted and given an opportunity to sign the petition, indicating their approval or disapproval concerning the installation of speed humps in the proposed location. Only the signature of the legal owner of the property will be proper for purposes of the petition. If both husband and wife are joint legal owners, both signatures are required. A "Mr. and Mrs." signature is not acceptable. All property owners must sign individually, including the owners of undeveloped lots. The signature of tenants to the property shall not be acceptable. No signature will be withdrawn from the petition after it is filed with the department. Each signature should also have the signature of a witness. The purpose of the witness' signature is to verify the signatures of the property owners, if in question. The percentages will be calculated, based on individual lots where owners sign affirmatively, divided by the total number of lots in the special assessment district. Each lot shall count as one vote, regardless of the number of owners signing the petition for that lot. Percentages of the homeowners as shown in subsection 50-52(1) must vote in favor. 
(c)  The completed petition must be signed, by an authorized representative of the subdivision, notarized, and then returned to the department, where it will be checked against tax records and land lot maps to insure that it meets all requirements. It will be returned to the sender if it does not meet the requirements. Petitions that do meet the requirements will be presented to the commissioners at a public meeting. In the case of a petition that fails to meet the requirements set forth herein, property owners must wait one year from the date of the initial request before requesting another study of that same street(s). 
(5)  Public hearing before board of commissioners. A public hearing before the board of commissioners will be announced following submission of a petition meeting the requirements set forth in subsection (4) above. At the public hearing, the petition will be approved or disapproved by the board of commissioners in their sole discretion and contingent upon availability of funds for this purpose. 
(6)  Miscellaneous program provisions. 
(a)  The time span from receiving the petition to installation of the speed humps will be approximately four to six months. It is recognized, however, that factors beyond the county's control may delay the installation of the speed humps. 
(b)  Speed hump program fee schedule is as follows: If preliminary field inspection and the traffic study warrant speed humps, and if approved by the board of commissioners, then the installation of the speed humps shall initially be funded and installed by the department. Thereafter, an annual fee for the installation, maintenance, repair and removal of the speed humps shall be $20.00 per year per each lot located in the special assessment district. Such assessment may be amended from time to time by the public works department, upon the written approval of the chairman of the board of commissioners and the chief of operations. In the event that the position of public works director is vacant, the amount of the assessment may be amended from time to time by the chief of operations, upon the written approval of the chairman of the board of commissioners. 
(c)  The removal of speed humps may proceed or occur if the county is presented with a petition requesting that speed humps be removed. Percentages of the homeowners as shown in subsection 50-52(1) must vote in favor of removing the speed humps. Such a petition must be signed by property owners in accordance with the criteria set forth in paragraph (b) above, and the approval percentage will be calculated in the manner set forth in paragraph (b) above. Such a petition for speed hump removal will only be considered after speed humps have been in place for a period of at least one year after final installation. Walton County reserves the authority to remove the speed humps at any time for reasons of safety, changes in: regulatory requirements, laws, guidelines and any new construction. All previously paid assessments are non-refundable upon removal of the speed humps. 
(d)  For subdivisions not completely built out or complete, a minimum of 60 percent of the total units must be occupied before a petition for the installation of speed humps may be considered.
