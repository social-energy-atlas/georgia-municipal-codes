PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Long County, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order within each subpart, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

This publication was under the direct supervision of Julie E. Lovelace, Code Attorney, and Rebecca Evans, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

Chapter 1 - GENERAL PROVISIONS

Generally.

In all interpolations the courts shall look diligently for the intention of the board of commissioners, keeping in view, at all times, the old law, the evil and the remedy. Grammatical errors shall not vitiate, and a transposition of words and clauses may be resorted to when the sentence or clause is without meaning as it stands. While subpart A is a codification of general ordinances and subpart B is a codification of ordinances pertaining to land development, provisions in subpart A may also apply to land development and provisions in subpart B may also apply to activities other than land development. The failure to include in subpart B provisions that relate to land development does not excuse noncompliance with such provisions. The inclusion in subpart B of provisions that relate to activities other than land development does not excuse noncompliance with such provisions.

(Ord. of 12-5-2006, § IV(A)) 
Sec. 18-47. - Best management practices. 
(a)	Best management practices as set forth in this section and section 18-48 shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director, or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b) of this section, or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this section, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(b)	A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm-water fisheries, or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale, unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(c)	Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority, or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(d)	The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.

Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation, as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat, and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat, and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and 
b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream, cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.	Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.	Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)	There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. title 12, ch. 5, art. 2, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer, or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.	No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer, and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time, as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat, and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and 
b.

Mandatory subscription ensures that residential solid waste is properly collected and disposed of in a manner that protects the health and safety of county residents. Likewise, the franchisee is required to provide curbside collection services to all county residents, both permanent and temporary. For renter-occupied properties, as feasible, curbside residential solid waste collection fees will be billed to and collected from the owner of the property in the same manner as owner-occupied properties.

In this event, the mobile home park owner will pay for dumpster service under the terms of the franchise agreement. 
(c)	In the event of an exclusive franchise, residents that do not compensate the franchisee for provided solid waste collection services are subject to termination of service. Because the county governing authority may be liable for outstanding subscriber collection fees, these fees may be collected through the county governing authority through the annual real property tax bill. 
(d)	All residential solid waste, less bulky waste, yard trash, and other items prohibited by the franchisee, shall be placed in county-approved containers provided by the franchisee. 
(e)	The county governing authority reserves the discretion and authority to grant, revoke, or rescind any franchise, in the interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the county citizens. 
(f)	Prior to engaging in solid waste handling in the county, a franchisee must have obtained a solid waste handling permit from the director of the environmental protection division of the state department of natural resources, or any successor agency authorized to issue permits pursuant to state law. 
(g)	All franchisees must meet minimum insurance requirements as determined at the discretion of the county governing authority. 
(h)	The franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the county, its officers, boards, commissions, employees, and agents, against any and all claims, suits, actions, liability, and judgments from third parties for damages which may be a result of willful, negligent, or tortuous conduct arising out of the business of collection, transportation, or disposal of solid waste. 
(i)	Franchisees shall provide an adequate number of vehicles for regular collection services, and these vehicles must conform to all applicable state laws and requirements of the state department of transportation and state department of natural resources. 
(j)	The franchisee shall maintain, at its place of business, records showing the names and addresses of all property owners and tenants with whom the franchisee contracted for solid waste collection services, including street addresses of properties served. The franchisee shall submit, upon reasonable request of the county governing authority, to a customer audit. 
(k)	All franchisees shall dispose of collected solid waste only at an approved, state-permitted disposal location. 
(l)	In lieu of a franchise fee, the franchisee shall apply any ordinary annual fee payable to the county for any franchise granted, pursuant to this section, to reduce the cost of collection services for county residents. 
(m)	The county governing authority at all times reserves the right to direct and control the time, place, and manner of solid waste collection and handling. 
(n)	The franchisee will be required to provide back door collection services for disabled and elderly customers under certain conditions. Any person who is incapable of moving his refuse to the curbside shall obtain a physician's certificate as to such disability. The physician's certificate must be presented to the county clerk prior to the franchisee providing this service. Back door collection will only be provided if no other able-bodied adults reside with the disabled or elderly individuals requesting this service.

(b)	Any accumulation of litter or rubbish items on any lot, property, premises, public street, alley or other public or private place not permitted by this chapter is hereby declared to be a nuisance.

All property owners in the county who wish to gain access to their property, whether for residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, or other purposes, by crossing a county-owned right-of-way, must utilize a driveway containing an appropriate-size culvert pipe as described in this article. In addition to future right-of-way crossings, this article applies to properties where existing driveways transverse the county right-of-way.

(b)	Installation and maintenance of culverts. In order to ensure consistency in the quality and type of material, the property owner must purchase all driveway culvert pipe, at cost, from the county clerk. Upon purchase of the pipe, the county road department will be responsible for installing and maintaining the pipe at no additional cost to the property owner. In the event that culvert pipe is damaged by the property owner or becomes unsuitable for use as determined by the county road superintendent, the property owner is responsible for purchasing replacement pipe through the county board of commissioners. Any culvert pipe damaged as a result of right-of-way maintenance activities by the county road department will be replaced at no charge by the county. 
(c)	Driveways along state-maintained routes. Only after: 
(1)	The property owner receives an appropriate right-of-way permit from the state department of transportation; and 
(2)	The permit is presented, along with payment for the pipe required by the state department of transportation permit, to the county clerk; 
the county road department will install driveway culvert pipe along state-maintained routes, at no cost for installation to the property owner.

Solar energy system means a system capable of collecting and converting solar radiation into heat or mechanical or electrical energy, and transferring these forms of energy by a separate apparatus to storage or to a point of use, including, but not limited to, water heating, space heating or cooling, electric energy generation, or mechanical energy generation. The term "solar energy system" shall include solar thermal, photovoltaic, and passive solar systems. 
Solar glare means the potential for solar panels to reflect sunlight, with an intensity sufficient to cause annoyance, discomfort, or loss in visual performance and visibility. 
Solar panel (or module) means a device for the direct conversion of sunlight into useable solar energy (including electricity or heat). 
Solar photovoltaic (solar PV) systems means solar systems consisting of photovoltaic cells, made with semiconducting materials, that produce electricity (in the form of direct current) when they are exposed to sunlight. A typical PV system consists of PV panels (or modules) that combine to form an array; other system components may include mounting racks and hardware, wiring for electrical connections, and power conditioning equipment, such as an inverter and/or batteries. For the purposes of this article, a solar PV system is defined as generating capacity of not more than 25 kilowatts for residential facilities, and not more than two megawatts for nonresidential facilities. 
Solar process heat means technologies that provide industrial specific applications, including ventilation air preheating, solar process heating, and solar cooling. 
Solar-ready means the concept of planning and building with the purpose of enabling future use of solar energy generation systems. Solar-ready buildings, lots, and developments make it easier and more cost-effective to utilize passive solar techniques and adopt active solar technologies in the future. Solar-ready buildings are built anticipating future installation of active solar energy systems (including structural reinforcement, pre-wiring or plumbing for solar, and east-west building orientation). Solar-ready lots are oriented to take maximal advantage of a location's solar resource. Solar-ready developments expand this concept to entire subdivisions. 
Solar thermal system (solar hot water or solar heating systems) means a solar energy system that directly heats water or other liquid using sunlight. A solar thermal system consists of a series of tubes that concentrate light to heat either water or a heat-transfer fluid (such as food-grade propylene glycol, a nontoxic substance) in one of two types of collectors (flat-plate collectors and evacuated tube collectors). The heated liquid is used for such purposes as space heating and cooling, domestic hot water, and heating pool water. 
Thin film solar PV means thin film solar PV cells capable of generating electricity from the sun, consisting of layers of semiconductor materials (made from amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride, and copper indium gallium diselenide, among other materials) a few micrometers thick, which allow for greater flexibility. Thin film is made by depositing one or more thin layers of photovoltaic material on a substrate; products include rooftop shingles and tiles, building facades, the glazing for skylights, and other building integrated materials. 
Tilt means the angle of the solar panels and/or solar collector relative to their latitude. The optimal tilt to maximize solar production is perpendicular, or 90 degrees, to the sun's rays at true solar noon. True solar noon is when the sun is at its highest during its daily east-west path across the sky (this is also known as 0 degrees azimuth). Solar energy systems can be manually or automatically adjusted throughout the year. Alternatively, fixed-tilt systems remain at a static tilt year-round 
Watts (W) means a measure of the use of electrical power (power (watts) = voltage (volts) X current (amps)). 
Wiring. Specified by electrical codes, solar PV system wires are routed from the panels or micro-inverters through conduit into the inverter and buildings meter.

ARTICLE IV. - APPLICATION AND PROCEDURE 

Sec. 118-98. - Subdivision process. 
(a)	Five-step review process. The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of five separate steps. These are: 
(1)	Step 1: Review of the sketch plan by the planning board/governing authority/designee. 
(2)	Step 2: Review and recommendation of the preliminary plat by the planning board. 
(3)	Step 3: Review and approval of the preliminary plat by the governing authority. 
(4)	Step 4: Review and approval of the proposed development plan by the governing authority or its designee. 
(5)	Step 5: Review and approval of the final plat by the governing authority. 
(b)	Step 1 may be, and steps 2 and 3 and 4 shall be, completed prior to making any street improvements, or installing any utilities. Step 5 shall be completed prior to the sale of any lots in the proposed subdivision. The site proposed to be subdivided must be zoned in the appropriate residential, commercial, industrial, planned development or other zoning district prior to the completion of step 2. 
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 6.12) 
Sec. 118-99. - Review procedure. 
The following procedure shall be followed in the submission, review, and action upon all subdivision plats: 
(1)	Sketch plan review procedures. Prior to the filing of a preliminary plat, the subdivider shall submit to the code enforcement official a simple sketch plan of the proposed subdivision. The sketch plan may be a simple freehand drawing. Included with the sketch plan should be a sketch map, which shows the subdivision in relation to the surrounding area. The purpose of the sketch plan is to assist the subdivider prior to extensive site planning for the preparation of the preliminary plat, and enable the subdivider to become familiar with the regulations affecting the land to be subdivided. The code enforcement official shall coordinate for the review of the sketch plan for zoning measures and approve, disapprove, or approve with modification the sketch plan zoning within 15 days from the meeting at which it is presented. Pertinent comments and recommendations shall be noted in the minutes of the planning board meeting. The secretary shall also forward copies of the sketch plan to the governing authority for review. 
(2)	Preliminary plat procedures. Application for preliminary approval of a subdivision plat shall be submitted to the code enforcement office at least 25 days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting date of the planning board. The plat of the subdivision shall be submitted in six blackline or blueline prints and shall be such as to meet the minimum requirements contained herein, as well as one electronic copy in a read-only format acceptable to the planning board. Any preliminary plat submitted to the planning board shall contain the name and address of the subdivider (or subdivider's designee) to whom a notice of hearing may be sent, and no preliminary plat shall be acted upon by the planning board without affording a hearing thereon, notice of the time and place of which shall be sent to said address not less than five days before the date of the hearing. 
a.	The code enforcement official may request additional copies of the plat and supplemental information. The person or agency to which a copy of the preliminary plat is directed shall review the preliminary plat and indicate any required changes or comments on the plat and submit to the planning board prior to the formal presentation of the preliminary plat. The local governing authority shall approve the preliminary plat following action by the planning board. 
b.	The code enforcement official shall examine the preliminary plat to determine if it meets all requirements of these regulations and shall place a preliminary plat on the agenda of the planning board for its action. 
c.	The subdivider must provide written assurance of availability of adequate water and sewer service from a public or private provider. If water and/or sewer service is available through the City of Ludowici and/or Long County, the subdivider shall be required to obtain services through local means. If water and/or sewerage systems not connected to a municipal system are to be installed, the subdivider is to indicate who will own the system, who will operate the system, and what assurance will be given to the governing authority for continued operation. 
d.	The planning and zoning board shall act on the preliminary plat within 45 days after formal submission and having received confirmation of all necessary approvals as described in subsections (2)a, b, and c of this section. Failure of the planning board to act within 45 days after formal submission of the complete preliminary plat shall be deemed to constitute approval, and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the planning board on demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of such period. The action of the board shall be recorded in the minutes of the board meeting. 
e.	The planning and zoning board shall vote to approve or disapprove the preliminary plat. Failure of a subdivider to initiate any development within 18 months from the approval of the preliminary plat will require the preliminary plat to be resubmitted to the planning board for approval. The developer shall not initiate action to change any of the existing conditions reported on the preliminary plat as required by section 118-161 until the preliminary plat has been approved by the governing authority and a proposed development plan approved by building official or his designee. 
f.	Approval of a preliminary subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plat. Preliminary approval shall constitute approval of the proposed widths and alignments of streets, location of other required easements, and the dimensions and shapes of lots. Application for approval of the final plat will be considered only after the requirements for the final plat approval as specified herein have been fulfilled, and after all other specified conditions have been met. Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plat by the planning board and the governing authority, the subdivider may proceed to comply with the other requirements of these regulations and the preparation of the final subdivision plat. 
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 6.13) 
Sec. 118-100. - Modification of requirements. 
(a)	Modification of requirement for sketch plan review. Where the governing authority determines that the additional step of requiring submittal and review of a sketch plat is unnecessary in the case of a specific application, it may allow the applicant to submit a final plat upon approval of a preliminary plat. Care should be taken that all of the issues addressed by the sketch plat review are adequately addressed in the final plat review. 
(b)	Modification of requirement for family conveyance subdivision. Where the governing authority determines that the proposed subdivision represents a division of land with the bona fide intent of transferring land to a member of the subdivider's family, it may modify requirements relative to the construction and dedication of public roads and other public improvements. The subdivider is cautioned that this does not relieve him of any obligations for access, and that consideration should be given to the future ability to develop land without adequate roads or improvements. For the purposes of this provision, a family member shall include a spouse, sibling, parent, or child of at least one owner of record of the subject property. 
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, §§ 6.10, 6.10.1) 
Sec. 118-101. - Sketch plans and preliminary plats not required. 
Subdivisions which do not involve platting, construction or opening of new streets, new facilities or improvements to municipal, public, or community water, or sewer facilities, or improvement of existing streets, shall be accepted by the planning board in the form of a final plat. Such plat shall comply in all respects to these regulations. Sketch plans and preliminary plats are not required in such cases, but construction drawings of selected existing improvements may be required by the staff. The following exceptions are included for the purpose of authorizing that the building official may approve such subdivisions: 
(1)	Family conveyance exception. When the applicant certifies to the planning board that the applicant's intended division of the land is only for conveyance to one or more family members for single-family residential or agricultural use in lands currently zoned for agricultural or agricultural and rural residential uses, the secretary of the planning board may receive the final plat as information and indicate the final plat may be recorded. The term "family member" is defined as the applicant's spouse, natural or adopted children, stepchildren, father, mother, sister, brother or grandchildren. To satisfy the requirements for a family conveyance exemption, one of the two following conditions must be met: 
a.	Condition one: 
1.	The division of land must be into 15 or fewer parcels, and conveyed to one or more family members; 
2.	No new public streets or other public infrastructure improvements are involved; and 
3.	The resulting lots are a minimum of one acre, and meet the required frontage for the zoning of the property, except when a single parcel is subdivided into two new parcels of at least one acre each. In these cases each of the two new parcels must have the maximum feasible direct frontage on an existing county or public road, but in no case shall the frontage be less than 30 feet; or 
b.	Condition two: 
1.	The division of land must be into 15 or fewer parcels, and conveyed to one or more family members; 
2.	No new public streets, or other public infrastructure improvements, are involved; 
3.	If the resultant lots are a minimum of one acre, but all lots do not have direct access that meet the required frontage for the zoning district to an existing public street or way, then the plat shall include a permanent, nonexclusive 60-foot access easement from an existing public street to all lots which do not have access with required frontage to existing public streets or ways, and are otherwise equal to the standard of the governing authority in which the division of land is being made; and 
4.	All lots or parcels abutting any platted access easement following this exception shall include a disclosure that the easement or street is not a publicly maintained street, and the street shall be maintained by the owners of the property within such subdivisions, and the governing authority has no responsibility whatsoever for their maintenance and repair, until and unless improved to approved street standards and dedicated and accepted by the governing authority. 
The resulting family subdivision in these cases shall be restricted from further subdivision, unless the further subdivision meets all requirements of this chapter. 
(2)	Minor rural land conveyance exception. When the applicant certifies to the planning board that the applicant's intended division of the land is only for subdivision of rural lands currently zoned for agricultural (A-1) or agricultural and rural residential (R-R) uses, the secretary of the planning board may receive the final plat as information, and indicate the final plat may be recorded. The conditions required to meet the requirements for a minor rural land conveyance exemption are as follows: 
a.	The land may be divided into no more than ten parcels; 
b.	Minimum parcel size shall be five acres, and the minimum lot width shall be 150 feet; 
c.	If all parcels do not have direct access that meet the required 150-foot frontage to an existing public street or way, then the plat shall include a permanent, non-exclusive 60-foot access easement from an existing public street to all lots which do not have access with required frontage to existing public streets or ways, and are otherwise equal to the standard of the governing authority in which the division of land is being made; 
d.	The parcels that result from this exemption shall be restricted from further subdivision or extension, until all requirements of this chapter are met; 
e.	The future paving of any street in the subdivision will be at the abutting property owner's expense; and 
f.	In order to ensure the proper provision of emergency or other services by the county or other entities, when any dwelling units are constructed on any parcel served by the easement described in subsection (2)c of this section, no certificate of occupancy shall be given until a roadway meeting the standards contained in section 118-313 for unpaved minor streets is constructed by the property owners. All such streets or roadways shall be private streets and meet all requirements for a private street exception, other than paving. 
(3)	Shared access conveyance exception for rural areas. The secretary of the planning board or building official may approve a final plat when the applicant seeks to create a minimum 30-foot wide exclusive driveway access easement to serve not more than two lots in agriculture/forestry or rural residential zoned areas. The two resulting lots shall share the common exclusive driveway access easement, and shall not be further subdivided in the future, unless the driveway easement is upgraded to the county standards for a public or private road. 
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 6.14) 
Sec. 118-102. - Final plat procedure. 
(a)	After completion of the physical development of public water, nonpotable reuse water lines, sewer, drainage, and roadway base and curb and gutter as shown on the approved development plan, the subdivider may submit to the secretary of the planning board copies of the final plat, and one electronic copy in a format acceptable to the planning board, prepared in accordance with the provisions of these regulations, along with the required certificates executed by the appropriate officials. Application for approval of a final plat shall be submitted to the secretary of the planning board. A bond or letter of credit for an amount necessary to complete any remaining primary and secondary improvements shall be submitted at least ten days prior to the regularly scheduled meeting date of the governing authority. Remaining primary improvements must be completed within six months from the date of final plat approval by the governing authority. Remaining secondary improvements must be completed within two years from the date of final plat approval by the governing authority. 
(b)	Until a final plat of a subdivision has been submitted to, reviewed and approved, and signed by the planning board and governing authority, the clerk of the county superior court shall not record the plat of such subdivision, nor shall the owner or agent of such subdivision transfer title to any lot within the subdivision by reference to the subdivision plat. For large subdivisions the final plat may be submitted for approval in contiguous sections satisfactory to the governing authority. 
(c)	The installation of streets, sidewalks, drainage systems, water, nonpotable reuse water lines, and sewerage systems, and other improvements shall be in compliance with the governing authority's standard specifications for materials and installation procedures on file with the planning board and the governing authority's flood regulations. The elevation of fill and the installation of streets, drainage systems, water, nonpotable reuse water lines and/or sewerage systems shall be certified by the developer's registered engineer as being in compliance with applicable requirements before approval of the final plat. 
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 6.13.4) 
Sec. 118-103. - Final approval. 
Final approval of the plat shall be by the governing authority. 
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 6.13.5)

(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 6.15) 
Sec. 118-106. - Approval of subdivision in floodprone area and developments adjacent to state waters. 
Standards for floodprone area uses. All subdivisions must be designed to minimize flood damage; all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems shall be located, elevated, and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; adequate drainage must be provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; water supply systems and/or sanitary sewage systems must be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into the floodwaters; on-site waste disposal systems must be located so as to avoid impairment of them or contamination from them during flooding. These additional standards shall also apply to floodprone areas: 
(1)	Structures (temporary or permanent). 
a.	All structures shall be designed consistent with all federal flood insurance standards. 
b.	Structures shall have a low flood damage potential. 
c.	The structure, if permitted, shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of floodwater. 
1.	Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow; and 
2.	So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately on the same flood flow lines as those adjoining structures. 
d.	Structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation which may result in damage to other structures, restriction of bridge openings and other narrow sections of the stream or river. 
e.	Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall be constructed at or above the 100-year floodplain elevation for the particular area, or be floodproofed. 
(2)	Storage of material and equipment. 
a.	The storage or processing of materials that are in time of flooding buoyant, flammable, explosive or could be injurious to human, animal or plant life is prohibited. 
b.	Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not subject to major damage by floods, and firmly anchored to prevent flotation, or readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning. 
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, §§ 6.16.1—6.16.3) 
Sec. 118-107. - Standards for areas adjacent to state waters. 
All subdivisions or planned developments must be designed to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff from development that may affect the state waters as defined in the governing authority's Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Ordinance in chapter 18, article II of subpart A. Stormwater should meet the stormwater runoff quality minimum standard number 2 of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual before it is discharged. A plan for any buffers and handling of stormwater shall be included with all preliminary plats or site development plans. This plan may be included as an attachment to the proposed development plan and must be reviewed and approved by the governing authority staff. 
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 6.16.4) 
Sec. 118-108. - Resubdivision of land. 
(a)	Whenever a parcel of land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land, and it is intended that such lots will eventually be resubdivided into small building sites, the governing authority shall require that such parcel of land allow for the future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of such streets may be made a requirement of the plat, and the code enforcement official shall determine. 
(b)	Procedure for resubdivision. Whenever a developer desires to resubdivide an already approved final subdivision plat, the developer shall first obtain approval for the resubdivision by the same procedures prescribed for the subdivision of land. 
(c)	Resubdivision includes: 
(1)	Any change in any street layout or any other public improvement; 
(2)	Any change in any lot line; 
(3)	Any change in the amount of land reserved for public use or the common use of lot owners; 
(4)	Any change in any easements shown on the approved plat. 
(d)	Waivers. Whenever the governing authority, in its sole discretion, makes a finding on the record that the purposes of these regulations may be served by permitting resubdivision by the procedure established in this subsection, the governing authority may waive the requirement of subsection (a) of this section. The governing authority, after an application for resubdivision that includes an express request for waiver, shall publish notice of the application in a local newspaper of general circulation and shall provide personal notice to property owners in the subdivision. The notice shall include: 
(1)	The name and legal description of the subdivision affected by the application; 
(2)	The proposed changes in the final subdivision plat; 
(3)	The place and time at which the application and any accompanying documents may be reviewed by the public; 
(4)	The place and time at which written comments on the proposed resubdivision may be submitted by the public; and 
(5)	The place and time of the public meeting at which the governing authority will consider whether to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the proposed resubdivision. 
(e)	Procedure for subdivisions when future resubdivision is indicated. Whenever land is subdivided and the subdivision plat shows one or more lots containing more than one acre of land and there is reason to believe that such lots eventually will be resubdivided, the governing authority may require that the applicant allow for the future opening of streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. Easements providing for the future opening and extension of streets may be made a requirement of plat approval.

ARTICLE VI. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS 

Sec. 118-212. - Installation; exceptions. 
A well designed subdivision or development includes improvements that provide for the safety and security of all citizens, includes adequate open spaces for recreation and circulation, preserves and protects wetlands, streams and marshes, and promotes the overall public good. A subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until such buyer can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise, a subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed and provide adequate levels of service. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get useable products, and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community, the subdivider shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by these regulations necessary to serve the subdivision prior to the approval of the final plat. Any request for an exception to these required improvements must be documented by the developer, and address the reason for the exception and why it meets the spirit and intent of these regulations. 
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 6.19.1) 
Sec. 118-213. - Natural gas. 
When gas lines are located in a street right-of-way, where possible, such lines shall be located outside the portion of the street to be surfaced as per the typical roadway detail to prevent having to cut into the paved surface to serve abutting properties. 
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 6.19.1.1) 
Sec. 118-214. - Water supply. 
All lots, tracts or parcels must be served by a water source. The water source may be an individual water system, a municipal/county water system, or a community water system. The water source must be approved by the governing authority, the health department and, when necessary, the environmental protection division of the state department of natural resources. All required improvements must meet the requirements of these agencies. Individual wells shall be installed in accordance with the rules and administrative regulations of the county health department. 
(1)	Subdivisions located in any municipality, or near or adjacent to an existing municipal/county water supply, shall connect to that municipal/county water supply, unless the municipality/county certifies that it will not supply water to the proposed development. 
(2)	Subdivisions not located within and served by a municipality/county owned water system and located adjacent to an existing private water supply may connect to that water supply provided that the owner agrees to the connection in writing, that the proposed system is approved as mentioned above, and that the existing system is capable of providing an adequate supply of water. 
(3)	When the water main is located in the street to serve the abutting lots, a water service line shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot before the street is surfaced. The location of each service line shall be marked clearly on the record drawings and submitted to the governing authority. 
(4)	All developments shall address provisions for fire protection.

(5)	The governing authority must be able to draw the outstanding balance of money upon presentation of a signed statement by the governing authority as a cash bond to secure continued adherence to the terms of the agreement. This clause would be utilized in the event the lending institution chooses not to extend the expiration date and improvements are not complete. 
(6)	The lending institution will receive the original letter of credit marked "Cancel" upon tender of payment or upon completion of improvements to the satisfaction of the governing authority. 
(7)	The lending institution must agree to be responsible for the governing authority's court costs and attorney fees in the event the governing authority initiates a suit under the letter of credit. 
(8)	The letter of credit must state that the letter of credit is specifically governed by the uniform commercial code (or similar code) in force in the state. 
(9)	An example of an irrevocable letter of credit is available in the office of the zoning administrator. Other types of bonding, guarantees, sureties or other similar security arrangements may be accepted if approved by the governing authority's attorney.

DIVISION 9. - QUALITY DEVELOPMENTS 

Sec. 118-502. - Intent. 
It is not the intent of these regulations to freeze new developments into any single type of design. It is, however, the intent of these regulations to ensure that all new developments shall contribute to the building of economically sound, sustainable and desirable areas within the community with all necessary services and facilities. The purpose of the designation of quality developments is to allow the utilization of land while ensuring that there are little or no detrimental impacts on the environment, neighboring properties, and the public safety, welfare and interest. The intent is that all quality developments far exceed the minimum standards defined and encourage innovation in development that enhances and improves public safety and welfare. 
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 6.21.2.1) 
Sec. 118-503. - Authority to modify standards. 
(a)	In order to provide the developer with maximum flexibility in the design and character of new subdivisions and other planned developments, the planning board is hereby authorized to recommend that the governing authority modify the standards and requirements, but not the intent of these regulations and zoning standards, in the case of a plan that exhibits unique quality growth features within a planned unit, which, in the judgment of the planning board: 
(1)	Provides significant public spaces for circulation, recreation, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully developed and populated; 
(2)	Which exhibits unique "quality" features in keeping with state department of community affairs principles; 
(3)	Which addresses each of the county's quality development guidelines; and 
(4)	Which provides such covenants or other legal provisions as will ensure conformity to and achievement of the comprehensive development plan. 
(b)	Any development considered for "quality development" status shall be analyzed using these principles and the guidelines listed below. The following is a list of the county's performance guidelines against which all proposed quality developments will be analyzed: 
(1)	Does the proposed development provide an appropriate and significant amount of uplands dedicated to open space, recreational, and other public uses that are available for the use and enjoyment of the residents and users of the development and citizens of the county? 
(2)	Will the development as designed minimize impacts to, and preserve, wetlands and floodplains? 
(3)	Has the proposal minimized the impervious surfaces in order to minimize stormwater runoff, and does it include the use of measures such as low impact design or other strategies to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of all runoff? 
(4)	Are the connectivity of open spaces and wetlands maximized in such a way as to create and preserve habitat areas for wildlife? 
(5)	Does the design maximize the preservation and protection of large hardwood trees and woodlands in wetlands and uplands? 
(6)	Does the proposal minimize or include mitigation for impacts on the county's, and the neighboring governments', infrastructure systems? 
(c)	The planning board and governing authority staff shall review the proposed development in accordance with these guidelines and the principles, and may consider modification of standards and requirements should the proposed development exceed the subdivision regulations and adequately address each of these principles and guidelines. The developer or subdivider shall request that the governing authority staff consider the development for designation as a "quality development" and provide the information required by the planning board and governing authority staff in order to evaluate the request for the designation and the modification of any standards or requirements.

(1)	The boundary line of any property zoned CON, RR, R-1, R-2 or MFR; or 
(2)	Any single-family residential dwelling located upon property not zoned CON, RR, R-1, R-2 or MFR, unless the applicant can show that the denial of a permit in such a location will cause a significantly harmful and permanent degradation of service which cannot be overcome by any other means including planned or potential locations which would provide the same or similar coverage or capacity; provided, however, that a tower (or use of an alternative tower structure) may, absent such showing, be permitted within 2,000 feet of any residential dwelling located on property not zoned CON, RR, R-1, R-2 or MFR upon the written consent of the owner of such residentially used property. Applications for placement of a tower (or use of an alternative tower structure) within 2,000 feet of the external boundary line of any property zoned RR, R-1, R-2 or MFR shall be available only through the conditional use permit process. 
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 13.7) 
Sec. 122-306. - Principal or accessory use. 
A tower and/or antenna is considered a principal use if located on any lot or parcel of land as the sole or primary structure, and is considered an accessory use if located on a lot or parcel shared with a different existing primary use or existing structure. An existing use or structure on the same lot or parcel shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with zoning district requirements, including, but not limited to, set-back, buffer and other requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot or parcel shall control, even though the antenna or tower may be located on a leased area within such lot or parcel. Towers that are constructed and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this subpart shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use of structure.

Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of ten feet in width and eight feet in height at planting and located outside the fenced perimeter of the compound. 
(2)	Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be utilized. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
(3)	Landscaping shall be maintained by the provider and shall be subject to periodic review by the building official to ensure proper maintenance. Failure to maintain landscaping shall be deemed a violation of this subpart. 
(4)	Amateur radio towers and antennas, or receive-only antennas shall not be subject to this section unless specifically required by the governing authority by virtue of other provisions of the Long County-City of Ludowici Land Development Code. 
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 13.3.7) 
Sec. 122-313. - Maintenance impact. 
Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street, utilizing existing access to the property on which such facility is to be located, where possible. 
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 13.3.8) 
Sec. 122-314. - Federal requirements. 
All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the permittee, owner or the lessee of the tower and/or antenna governed by this subpart shall bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more or less stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring such tower and/or antenna into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall be deemed to be a declaration of abandonment of the tower and/or antenna and constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's, permittee's, or lessee's expense. Any such removal by the governing authority shall be in the manner provided by the Long County-City of Ludowici Land Development Code, governing unsafe or abandoned structures. 
(Ord. of 2-3-2015, § 13.3.9) 
Sec. 122-315. - Building codes and safety codes. 
To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee of a tower or alternative tower structure shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Telecommunications Industry Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the building official concludes that a tower fails to comply with all applicable codes and standards, or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon receipt of written notice by the owner, permittee or lessee of the tower, said party shall have 15 days to bring the tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance within 15 days shall be deemed a declaration of abandonment of the tower and constitute grounds for removal of the tower as provided in division 5 of this chapter. Prior to the removal of any tower, the building official may consider detailed plans submitted by the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee for repair of substandard towers, and may grant a reasonable extension of the above referenced compliance period.
