PREFACE
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Cordele, Georgia.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1977 Code, as supplemented through May 1, 1979, and
ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note
appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted
for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the
reader can locate any section of the 1977 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each
chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to
relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code
is included at the back of this Code.
Numbering System
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section
number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure
after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-
2, and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same
time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for
amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-
2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If
the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken
that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions
may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject,
and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number
shall be assigned to the new article or division.
Index
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some
of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local
government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which stand as guideposts to
direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With
this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the
appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the
publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets
are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached
instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to
avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

permit, and the employee being ineligible to reapply for such a permit.

Sec. 3-168. - Prohibition of certain types of entertainment, attire and conduct.
(a)
Findings; public purpose. Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to,
Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Richmond County, Georgia; Amarillo, Texas; Austin,
Texas; Garden Grove, California; Houston, Texas; Renton, Washington; Phoenix, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; St. Paul,
Minnesota; Tucson, Arizona; Augusta, Georgia; LaGrange, Georgia; Dalton and Whitfield County, Georgia; Carrollton,
Georgia; Smyrna, Georgia; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences the city commission believes
are relevant to the problems faced by the City of Cordele, the city commission takes note of the notorious and self-evident
conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally
comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of the city commission that public nudity (either
partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic
5/6/2019 Cordele, GA Code of Ordinances
94/489
beverages, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal
behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the
undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding
neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased
burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described, and acceleration of
community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct
in establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest,
and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated
with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. To that end, this section is hereby
adopted.
(b)
Enactment. The following types of entertainment, attire and conduct are prohibited upon any premises licensed to sell,
serve or disperse liquor by the drink.
(1)
The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of liquor by the drink while such person is
unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing, as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the
areola or any portion of the male or female pubic hair, anus, cleft or the buttocks, vulva and genitals.

The following rules and regulations are hereby adopted for all cemeteries owned and/or operated by the city, controlling
use of such cemeteries by present and future property owners, visitors within the cemeteries, and all other persons who
may be upon the premises of the cemeteries for any purpose. Such rules and regulations may be amended by the city
commission as it, in its sound discretion, may deem necessary and proper. All deeds and instruments hereafter issued by the
city conveying ownership of lots and rights of interment shall contain the stipulation that the same are subject to provisions
of this chapter, such stipulation being of the same force and effect as if this chapter, as the same may be hereinafter
amended, had been quoted verbatim in such deeds and instruments.
(1)
a.
All human remains and cremations to be buried in Sunnyside or Bethel Cemeteries shall be placed in an outer burial
container. All outer burial containers (vaults) shall be constructed of materials other than wood or cardboard, such as
concrete. No wood or cardboard containers will be allowed. All vaults must be installed in the ground with the tops thereof
not less than twelve (12) inches below the finished grade of the surrounding surface.

The city will not provide a pauper's grave space for any deceased person whose legal residence address is outside the city;
however, paupers' grave spaces will be provided for indigent deceased persons whose identities, residences and families

regulated by this chapter to furnish the city clerk with a legible copy of the burial-removal-transit permit required for such
deceased person by the Georgia Department of Human Resources. In the event the Georgia Department of Human
Resources abolishes the use of said permit then the city shall provide a city form for such burial to be filed with the city
clerk as aforesaid. In addition, such director shall also furnish the city clerk with the block, lot and grave numbers used for
the interment of such deceased persons.

All grading, landscape work and improvements of any kind, and care of the lots shall be done, and all trees and shrubs
moved and herbage of any kind, with the exception of planting grass, shall be done by the city. The planting of grasses on

planting of shrubs and flowers are made by the city and further planting may be permitted only at the discretion of the

plantings shall be under the control of the city including the following additional care: Removal of rubbish when necessary,
raking and cutting of grass, trimming of trees and shrubbery and other care that city may deem necessary. The ownership of
rights of interment in lots does not convey any right to do planting without the express approval of the city commission.
The city herewith retains supervision of all lots in the city and, upon hearing before the city commission, the city may
prohibit, modify, or cause to be removed, any structure, object, or improvement which has been placed subsequent to the
adoption of these rules and regulations, and which may be considered objectionable, unsightly or injurious to the lot upon
which the same are located, adjoining lots, or the cemetery in general.

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
Sec. 10-1. - Authorization.
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Commission of the City of Cordele, Georgia, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. No. 0-09-02, 9-15-09)
Sec. 10-2. - Findings of fact.
(a)
The flood hazard areas of Cordele, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
(b)
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(Ord. No. 0-09-02, 9-15-09)
Sec. 10-3. - Statement of purpose.
5/6/2019 Cordele, GA Code of Ordinances
158/489
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1)
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the
time of initial construction;
(2)
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which
increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(3)
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
(4)
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase
flood hazards to other lands; and
(5)
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the
accommodation of floodwaters.
(Ord. No. 0-09-02, 9-15-09)
Sec. 10-4. - Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are:
(1)
To protect human life and health;
(2)
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines,
streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(3)
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as
to minimize flood blight areas,
(4)
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(5)
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the
general public;
(6)
To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and
(7)

Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the
first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles,
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home
on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or
foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant
to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE:
accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of
construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid

before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking
place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the
structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the
appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value
of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage,"
regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed.
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply
with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure
safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an
improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude
the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation
or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and
pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise
prohibited by this chapter.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain
management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other
5/6/2019 Cordele, GA Code of Ordinances

Sec. 10-62. - Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required:
5/6/2019 Cordele, GA Code of Ordinances
168/489
(1)
New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or
substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated
no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a

(2)
Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE,
or AH Zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities,
must be designed to be water tight to one (1) foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and
the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such
certification to the official as set forth above and in section 10-43(6).
(3)
Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available:
a.
All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or
substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks
or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has
incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower
than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation.
b.
Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be
elevated so that either:
1.
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the level of the base flood
elevation; or

5/6/2019 Cordele, GA Code of Ordinances
169/489
Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days.
2.
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels
or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently
attached structures or additions); or
3.
The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation
requirements of section 10-62(3)(a) and (c) above.
(4)
Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 10-22, are areas designated as floodway. A
floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area
must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights.
Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
a.
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development
within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic
and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result
in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must
provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.
b.
Only if section 10-62(4)(a) above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all
other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article IV.
(Ord. No. 0-09-02, 9-15-09)
Sec. 10-63. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-Zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 10-22, where streams exist but no base flood data
have been provided (A-Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the
following provisions apply:
(1)
When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 10-22, then the
director shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of article IV. Only if data are not
available from these sources, then the following provisions (subsections (2) and (3)) shall apply:
(2)
No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or
twenty (20) feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one (1) foot
increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(3)
In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing
structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three (3) feet
above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one (1) foot above the
estimated base flood elevation in A-Zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed.) Openings sufficient to
5/6/2019 Cordele, GA Code of Ordinances
170/489
facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 10-61(4),
"elevated buildings."
a.
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and
other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.

designated floodways.
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 10-22, where streams with base flood elevations are
provided but no floodways have been designated (Zones AE), the following provisions apply:
(1)
No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of
special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will
not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. The
engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
(2)
New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in
accordance with section 10-62
(Ord. No. 0-09-02, 9-15-09)
Sec. 10-65. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO Zones).
Areas of special flood hazard established in section 10-62, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These
areas have base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following
provisions apply:
(1)
All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the
highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least
three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters
shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 10-61(4), "elevated buildings."
The director shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.
(2)
New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation.
The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified
FIRM flood level plus one (1) foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of
buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in
accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the
official as set forth above and as required in section 10-42(1)(c) and (2).

ARTICLE V. - VARIANCE PROCEDURES
Sec. 10-81. - Generally.
(a)
The floodplain appeals board as established by the City Commission of the City of Cordele shall hear and decide requests
for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter.
(b)
The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made
by the director in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
(c)
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the floodplain appeals board may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of
Crisp County, Georgia, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
5/6/2019 Cordele, GA Code of Ordinances
172/489
(d)
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair
or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the
minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(e)
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria
of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood
damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
(f)
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge
would result.
(g)
In reviewing such requests, the floodplain appeals board shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all
standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter.
(h)
Conditions for variances:
(1)
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
a.
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
b.
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
c.
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local
laws or ordinances.
(2)
The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards
must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(3)
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood
elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate
with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(4)
The director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency upon request.
5/6/2019 Cordele, GA Code of Ordinances
173/489
(i)
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the floodplain appeals board may attach
such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

building permit shall be issued.

upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to the provisions or to interpret the meaning of
the provision so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided, however, that such variance, modification, or
interpretation shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the provisions so that the architectural or

Sec. 13-4. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices.
(a)
5/6/2019 Cordele, GA Code of Ordinances
211/489
General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if
requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing
activities which are not exempted by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and
pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution
control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum
requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features
of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements.
Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any landdisturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES general permit.
(b)
Minimum requirements/BMPS.
(1)
Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing
activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to
any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any
substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f),
the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed"
mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment
Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b).
(2)
A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed,
installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing
authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water
Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by
more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten
(10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be
measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance
associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale
unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres.
(3)
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing
permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-
30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
(4)
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the
turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur.
(5)
The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-
7-6(c).
(c)
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of
governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit;
and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion
and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual
for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of
January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
5/6/2019 Cordele, GA Code of Ordinances
212/489
(1)
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize
erosion;
(2)
Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(3)
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential;
(4)
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
(5)
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(6)
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(7)
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(8)
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(9)
To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps,
or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is
brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.;
(10)
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping
of fills;
(11)
Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
(12)
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other
property owners;
(13)
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible,
provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
(14)
Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or
control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude
5/6/2019 Cordele, GA Code of Ordinances
213/489
sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section;
(15)
Except as provided in subsection (c)(16) of this section, there is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along the banks of all
state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave
action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the
environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a
roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the
project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term
"ephemeral stream" means a stream that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration
after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is
not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as
along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5
of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as
provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of
vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site
is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect
water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed;
provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under
contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as
protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient
quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured
from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of
not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer, and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans
and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and
(16)
There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by
normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of
Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be
constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average
annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the
discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so
long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer
requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing
activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are
implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer:
a.
No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of
vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site
is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect
water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed;
provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under
contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as
protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient
quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b.
5/6/2019 Cordele, GA Code of Ordinances
214/489
The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured
from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of
not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project
plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines.
(d)
Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and
regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in
subsections (b) and (c) of this section.
(e)
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall
neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms
of the permit.
(Ord. No. 01-11-08, 5-3-11)
Sec. 13-5. - Application/permit process.
(a)
General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal
the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding
it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage
prevention ordinance, this chapter, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development
of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only
parties who may obtain a permit.
(b)
Application requirements.
(1)
No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Cordele without
first obtaining a permit from the designated representative to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent
submitted to EPD if applicable.
(2)
The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City of Cordele and must include the applicant's erosion,
sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the
data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting
data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the
provisions of section 13-4(b) and (c) of this chapter will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless
accompanied by three (3) copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall
contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in
accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-10. Application for a permit fee is seventy-five dollars ($75.00) and shall be charged to
each applicant. In addition to the fee shown above, the applicant shall present a fifty-dollar fee payable to the Middle South
Georgia Soil and Conservation Commission.
(3)
In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such
fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid
by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the
planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land
disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be
submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to
5/6/2019 Cordele, GA Code of Ordinances
215/489
O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing
authority in the jurisdiction.
(4)
Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and
plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and
pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the
district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district
review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the
district, and any variances required by section 13-4(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and
bonding, if required as per section 13-5(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing
authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review
and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan
review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the
local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the
revised plan submittal.
(5)
If a permit applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits, this ordinance section, or the Erosion and
Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three (3) years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the
local issuing authority may deny the permit application.
(6)
The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash,
irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per acre
or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply
with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any
part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity
and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically
providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged
permit violations.
(c)
Plan requirements.
(1)
Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 13-4(b) and (c) of this chapter, or
through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices.
The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter. The plan
for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological
characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed
waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and
supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land
development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet
the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as
developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to
O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20.
(2)
Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and
pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the landdisturbing activity was permitted.

Permits.
(1)
Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt by
the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and
all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity
may be undertaken.
(2)
No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has
been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance
with this chapter, any variances required by section 13-4(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary,
as per subsection (b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of
the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant.
(3)
Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this chapter, and any
other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such
requirements upon the local issuing authority.
(4)
If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase.
(5)
The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land
affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion
and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this chapter. A holder of a permit
shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions
contained in the permit.
(6)
The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits or the
Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three (3) years prior to the date of the application, in light of
O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).
(Ord. No. 01-11-08, 5-3-11)
Sec. 13-6. - Inspection and enforcement.
(a)
The City of Cordele will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to
determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are
effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and
tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for
installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing
activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where
the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and
maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a
person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit
conditions, or with the provisions of this chapter, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice
shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be
completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be
deemed in violation of this chapter.

(b)
The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within twelve (12) months of any
amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975.
(c)
The City of Cordele shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out
duties as prescribed in this chapter, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private,
for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities.
(d)
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the
commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate
credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying
out his official duties.
(e)
The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have
been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may
provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or
municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the
division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found.
(f)
The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing
authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the
administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any,
between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or
municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not
conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall
notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or
municipality so notified shall have ninety (90) days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain
certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within
ninety (90) days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as
a local issuing authority.
(Ord. No. 01-11-08, 5-3-11)
Sec. 13-7. - Penalties and incentives.
(a)
Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a
land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this chapter without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to
revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work
activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority.
(b)

(4)
When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts
of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being
discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and
maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All
such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective
action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the
exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls.
(c)
Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to
comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the
measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be
completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be
deemed in violation of this ordinance and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance
bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 13-5(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or
any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing
activity and bring it into compliance.
(d)
Monetary penalties.
(1)
Any person who violates any provisions of this chapter, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this
chapter, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director

ARTICLE X. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
DIVISION 1. - POSTCONSTRUCTION STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
Sec. 18-435. - General provisions.
(a)
Purpose. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general
welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment
stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been
determined that proper management of postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private
property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect
water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
(1)
Establish decision-making processes surrounding land-development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed
and preserve the health of water resources;
(2)
Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their
postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, nonpoint source pollution,
and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;
(3)
Establish minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control
of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
(4)
Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be
used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards;
(5)
Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the
preservation of green space and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable;
(6)
5/6/2019 Cordele, GA Code of Ordinances
292/489
Establish provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural storm water control facilities and
nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and
pose no threat to public safety; and,
(7)
Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans,
and for the inspection of approved active projects, and longterm follow up.
(b)
Applicability. All persons proposing development and/or construction within the city shall submit a stormwater
management plan and hydrology study to the city manager for review of conformity with this article, except as provided
herein. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one (1) or more of the following
criteria:
(1)
New development that involves the creation of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of new impervious cover, or that
involves other land development activities of one (1) acre or more;
(2)
Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of new

requirements of this Ordinance. Further, no division of any parcel shall be made which creates a lot with a width or area
less than specified by the requirements stated in this Ordinance.

to the adoption of this ordinance shall be permitted to be continued or re-occupied as a non-conforming use provided that:
(1)
No such non-conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a manner that increases its nonconformity, but any
structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity, provided that any such alteration must comply
with the requirements of this Ordinance and must not in itself be non-conforming;
(2)

requirements for the district in which it is located after it is moved.

Section 675. - Floodplain Overlay District.
675.1 Intent and purpose. It is the intent and purpose of this district to promote the public health, safety and general
welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by the enactment and
enforcement of provisions designed to: require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers that are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; control filling, grading
dredging and other development that may increase erosion or flood damage.
675.2 Land within this district. This district includes all areas of "special flood hazard" as established by the Flood
Damage Prevention Ordinance of the City of Cordele and identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its
Flood Insurance Study dated March 18, 1987, with accompanying maps and other supporting data, and any revision
thereto.
675.3 Permitted uses. Land uses within this district shall be those uses permitted within the underlying zoning district. All
development within this overly zone shall comply with the regulations of the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance in
addition to the regulations set forth in this Ordinance.
Section 680. - Planned Development.
680.1 Intent and purpose. The Planned Development District is established to permit flexibility in the design and
development of land in order to promote its most appropriate use; to promote high quality, logically organized and
compatible community development by encouraging developments to be planned on a larger scale; to allow a mixture
and/or density of land uses not otherwise allowed in an established zoning district by careful site planning that ensures
compatible relationships between uses within the planned development site and uses adjacent to the site; to encourage
creative site design that seeks to preserve the open space and unique environmental features, to conserve energy through
efficient building design and clustering, to use the land efficiently, and to increase the efficiency of public service delivery;
and to ensure that such large scale planned development proceeds in a manner consistent with the Comprehensive Plan for
the City of Cordele.
A Planned Development is a zoning technique under which the text of this Ordinance provides general guidelines for
development, but the districts are mapped only when a developer makes an application for a planned development project.
The approval process for a Planned Development involves rezoning the property to the Planned Development District
designation and simultaneous approval of a detailed site plan for the property. It is not the intent of this Ordinance to utilize
the Planned Development District solely to diminish the usual application of these regulations.
680.2 Planned development defined. For the purpose of this Ordinance, a Planned Development shall mean the
development of land under unified ownership or control which is planned and developed as a whole in a single or
programmed series of operations with uses and structures substantially related to the character of the entire development. A
Planned Development must also include a program for the provision, maintenance, and operation of all areas,
improvements, facilities, and necessary service for the common use of all occupants of the Planned Development.
680.3 Uses within a planned development. Any use allowed in a conventional zoning district herein may be proposed for
inclusion in a Planned Development. Each proposed use should be consistent in application with the intent and purpose of
the conventional zoning districts in which that use is allowed. Only the specific uses proposed in an application and
approved shall be allowed in the planned development. Any addition of uses, change of plans, or increase in size or density
shall require a separate amendment to the original approved Planned Development and shall follow the same administrative
process as any other zoning ordinance amendment. Initial approval of a Planned Development by the City of Cordele does
not mean that any subsequently proposed amendments to that Planned Development have a vested right to be approved.
Unless otherwise stated in this section, the development standards and land uses that are presented with an application for
amendment shall, if approved, become the standards for the subject property and shall become a part of these zoning
regulations.
680.4 General conditions.
(a)
5/6/2019 Cordele, GA Code of Ordinances
376/489
Planning Considerations. An area may be considered for rezoning to Planned Development District if any one of the

conventional zoning districts are being proposed as a part of a planned development.
(b)
Unified Ownership or Control. The title to all land within a proposed site for a Planned Development shall be owned or
controlled by the developer submitting the application for the Planned Development. The term "controlled by" shall mean
that the developer shall have the written consent of all owners of property within the proposed site that the developer does
not wholly own. Such consent shall contain a statement that such developer is authorized to represent such owners in the
submission of an application under the provisions of this section and that such owners agree to be bound by the decision of
the City Commission in the event such application is approved.
680.5 Special Site Requirements. All proposed Planned Development District applications shall conform to the following

of new and existing tower sites, (iii) encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas
where the adverse impact on the community is minimal, (iv) encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a
way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas, and (v) enhance the ability of the providers of
telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently.
Section 810. - Applicability.
810.1 District height limitations. The requirements set forth in this Article shall govern the location of telecommunication
towers that exceed, and antennas that are installed at a height in excess of, the height limitations specified for each zoning
district. The height limitations applicable to buildings and structures shall not apply to telecommunication towers and

For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations,
including but not limited to set-back requirements, lot-coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions
5/6/2019 Cordele, GA Code of Ordinances
392/489
of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers
that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this Article shall not be deemed to
constitute the expansion of a non-conforming use of a structure.

it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in the City of Cordele Building Code and the applicable standards
for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection,
the Chief Codes Official concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to
persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to
bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said

Before proceeding with a proposed land subdivision within the City of Cordele, owners are invited and encouraged to
discuss their proposed development with the Director of Community Development. A very preliminary sketch of the
proposed subdivision together with a map of the area showing its principal features will be helpful in this discussion. The
discussion will enable the owner to insure that the proposed subdivision is in compliance with the regulations contained
herein. This should prevent undue expense to the owner in the preparation of plats that must later be altered or changed.
The Director of Community Development may also be able to provide technical assistance to the owner in the most
economical layout of streets and utilities required in the subdivision. No fee shall be charged for the pre-application review
and no formal application shall be required.

Pumping requirements.
Design new sewers in residential areas on the basis of an average daily flow of sewage of not less than 400 gallons per
household per day. A peaking factor of not less than 3.0 must be applied to the average daily flow to establish peak design
flow. Sewers shall be designed to carry peak design flow when flowing one-half full.
In non-residential developments, base sewer design on the estimated peak flow from the development but in no case less
than 0.4 gallon per square foot of gross building areas. Sewers shall be designed to carry peak flow when flowing one-half
full.
(b)
Size and Shape: The minimum size sanitary sewer shall be 8 inches. Design sewers to give mean velocities, when flowing
half full, of not less than 2.0 feet per second based on the Manning formula using an "n" value of 0.013. Table 5.3 gives the
minimum slopes which must be provided, however, where possible greater slopes are desirable.
Place sewers with a uniform slope between manholes.

(c)
Manholes: Install manholes at the following locations:
(1)
End of each sewer.
(2)
At all changes in grade, size, or alignment.
5/6/2019 Cordele, GA Code of Ordinances
464/489
(3)
At all sewer intersections.
(4)
At distances not greater than 400 feet for sewer 15 inches.
When changing pipe sizes at a manhole, align the 0.8 depth point of both sewers at the same elevation. When the same size
pipe enters and leaves a manhole, provide at least a 0.1 foot drop in elevation between the entering and the exiting inverts.
Construct a U shaped flow channel through manholes.
(d)
Relation to Water Mains: Whenever possible, lay sewers at least 10 feet horizontally from any existing or proposed water
main. Should conditions prevent a separation of 10 feet, lay the lines in separate trenches. In either case, construct the
elevation of the crown of the sewer at least 18 inches below the bottom of the water main.
When sewers cross under water mains, lay the sewer so that the top of the sewer is at least 18 inches below the bottom of
the water main. Install the two pipes such that a full length of pipe will be centered over the crossing so that all joints will
be separated as much as possible. Install ductile iron pipe for both lines when the crossing is less than two feet of
separation.
(e)
When sewers are laid in public streets, construct the sewer along the centerline of the street at a depth of not less than 5 feet
from the road surface to the top of the pipe. In curved streets, install the sewer between gutter lines to avoid conflicts with
other utilities.
(f)
State Approval: It is the developer's responsibility to obtain the approval of the Environmental Protection Division of the
Georgia Department of Natural Resources for sanitary sewer collection system additions and extensions. In addition to
other requirements, the City must receive a copy of the approval before the developer will be allowed to proceed with
construction.
Section 5.7. - Natural gas system.
The natural gas system to serve a development will be designed and installed by the City. The City's responsibility will
terminate on the customer's side of the meter/regulator set. Natural gas meter/regulator set will be furnished and installed
by the City upon payment of appropriate fees.

call of the Chairman and at such other times as the Board may determine. All meetings of the Board shall be open to the
public.
Section 9.3. - Decisions.
The concurring vote of three (3) members of the Board of Development Appeals shall be necessary to reverse any order,
requirement, decision, or determination of the Director, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is
required to pass under this ordinance or to affect any variation of this Ordinance. The Board shall keep minutes of its
proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and
shall keep records of its examinations and other official action, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the
Board and shall be a public record. On all appeals, applications, and matters brought before the Board of Development
Appeals, the Board shall inform in writing all the parties involved of its decisions and the reasons therefor.
Section 9.4. - Appeals, hearings, and notice.
Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the City.
Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the Board by filing with the officer from
whom the appeal is taken and with the Board and Development Appeals' notice of said appeal specifying the grounds
thereof. The Director shall forthwith transmit to the Board all papers constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from was taken.
An appeal stays all legal proceeding in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is
taken certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with the officer, that by reason of facts stated in
5/6/2019 Cordele, GA Code of Ordinances
470/489
the certificate a stay would, in the officer's opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings
shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on
application, on notices to the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and on due cause shown.
The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal or other matter referred to it, and give public notice
thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. At the hearing any
party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.

To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by
the Director in the enforcement of this Ordinance.
-
To authorize, upon appeal, in specific cases a variance from the terms of this Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public
interest, where, vowing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance will in an individual
case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the Ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare
secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a
finding by the Board of Development Appeals that:
(a)
there are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its
size, shape, or topography;
(b)
the application of the Ordinance to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship;
(c)
such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and
(d)
relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purpose and intent of this
Ordinance, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited
in a given district by the Zoning Ordinance.
-
To decide on other matters where a decision of the Board of Development Appeals may be specifically required by the
provisions of this Ordinance. In exercising these powers, the Board of Development Appeals may be reversed or affirm,
wholly or in part, or may modify the order, requirements, decision, or determination, and to that end shall have all the
powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit. The Board, in the
execution of the duties for which appointed, may subpoena witnesses and in case of contempt may certify such fact to the
Superior Court.
