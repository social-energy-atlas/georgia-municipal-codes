PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of Columbia County, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1979 Code, as supplemented through November 16, 1999, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1979 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Ron K. McLaughlin, Code Attorney, and Leesa Hampton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Phebe Dent, County Clerk for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

Sec. 1-2-2. - Election of commissioners; terms of office. 
Section 1-2-2. "Election of commissioners; terms of office" is amended by deleting therefrom subsections (a), (b) and (c) and replacing therewith: 
(a)  The present members of the board of commissioners shall continue to serve out the terms of office for which they were elected and until their successors are elected and qualified. As of January 1, 2003, members of the board of commissioners shall be deemed to represent the commissioner districts provided for in Section 1-2-1 as follows: the commissioner from the old District 3 shall represent the new District 4, the commissioner from the old District 4 shall represent the new District 2 and the commissioner from the old District 5 shall represent the new District 3. The commissioner representing the new District 1 was elected in November 2002 and took office January 1, 2003. 
(b)  At the general election in November 2002, the chairperson and the member of the board from commissioner district 1 were elected and took office on the first day of January following their election for terms of four years. At the general election in November 2004, members from commissioner districts 2 and 3 were elected and took office on the first day of January following their election for terms of four years. At the general election in November 2004, a member from commissioner district 4 was elected and took office on the first day of January following his election for a term of two years. Thereafter, successors shall be elected in the general election immediately preceding the expiration of the term of office, shall take office on the first day of January following their election, and shall serve for terms of four years and until their successors are elected and qualified. In order to be elected as a member of the board of commissioners from a commissioner district, a candidate shall be a bona fide resident of such district. One member of the board shall be elected by the qualified voters of that commissioner district. The chairperson of the board of commissioners may reside anywhere within Columbia County and, if elected, must receive the number of votes cast for that office, as required by general law, in the entire county. The chairperson must continue to reside within the county during that person's term of office, or that office shall become vacant. 
(c)  In all elections pursuant to this Act, with the exception of candidates for the office of board chairperson, each candidate for the office of board member shall designate the district from which such candidate is offering. To be elected as a member of the board, a candidate must receive the highest number of votes cast for the particular seat the candidate is seeking and at the same time a candidate must receive a majority of the votes cast for such seat. Failure by any candidate to receive a majority of the votes for such seat shall cause a runoff election to be held for that seat in accordance with Chapter 2 of Title 21 of the O.C.G.A., the "Georgia Election Code." 
(d)  A vacancy shall be created in the office of any member of the board of commissioners who no longer resides within the district from which he/she was elected, and in the case of the chairperson a vacancy shall be created in the office if the chairperson no longer resides within the County. 
(1983 Ga. Laws, page 4607, § 2; Ord. No. 00-10, § 1, 10-3-2000; Ord. No. 07-02, § 1, 3-6-2007)

If the cost-of-living increase or general performance based increase received by state employees, is in different percentages or different amounts as to certain categories of employees, the amount to which a member of the board of commissioners is entitled shall be increased by a percentage or an amount not to exceed the average percentage or average amount of the general increase in salary granted to the state employees.

(i)  Compensation to which a member of the board of commissioners is entitled under subsection 1-2-5(a)(1) and (2) above shall be increased by multiplying said amounts by the percentage which equals 2.5 percent times the number of completed, four-year terms of office served by such member of the board of commissioners where such terms have been completed after December 31, 2004, effective the first day of January following the completion of each such period of service. 
(ii)  For a member of the board of commissioners elected to a two year term of office, the percentage increase provided for in subsection 1-2-5(a)(3)(i) of this section shall be 1.25 percent times the number of completed two-year terms. 
(4)  On and after January 1, 1989, the members of the board of commissioners shall be entitled to reimbursement for actual expenses incurred by members of the board outside of Columbia County in carrying out official county business, provided such expenses are approved by the board.

The procedure shall then be the same as in other cases except the court may assess costs as seem just.

(c)  If the plaintiff fails to appear, the action may be dismissed for want of prosecution, the defendant may proceed to a trial on the merits, or the case may be continued as the judge may direct. If both parties fail to appear, the judge may continue the case, order the same dismissed for want of prosecution, or make any other just and proper disposition thereof, as justice may require. 
Sec. 1-5-14. - Compulsory and permissive counterclaims. 
(a)  If any defendant has a claim against the plaintiff arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim, which claim does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties over whom the court cannot obtain jurisdiction, such claim must be asserted by the defendant at or before the hearing on the plaintiff's claim or thereafter be barred. 
(b)  If any defendant has a claim against the plaintiff other than a compulsory counterclaim described in subsection (a) of this Code section, such claim may be asserted by the defendant at or before the hearing on the plaintiff's claim. 
(c)  If any defendant asserts a claim against the plaintiff, the defendant shall file with the court a statement of claim in concise form and free from technicalities. The defendant shall sign and verify the statement of claim by oath or affirmation. At the request of a defendant, the judge or clerk may prepare the statement. 
(d)  If the amount of counterclaim exceeds the jurisdictional limits of the magistrate court, the case shall be transferred to any court of the county which has jurisdictional limits which exceed the amount of the counterclaim. If there is more than one (1) court to which the action may be transferred, the parties may agree on the court to which the action shall be transferred, and, in the absence of any agreement, the judge of the magistrate court shall determine the court to which the action shall be transferred. If there is no other court to which the action may be transferred, it shall be transferred to the superior court of the county.

(b)  The judge of the magistrate court shall not be obligated to collect such deferred partial payments on judgments so rendered but, if the plaintiff so requests, he may do so at the expense of the plaintiff for clerical and accounting costs incurred thereby, not to exceed ten (10) percent of each payment. 
Sec. 1-5-16. - Effect, recordation, execution, and enforcement of money judgments; fee of recordation. 
(a)  Except where otherwise provided by law, the general laws and rules applicable to the effect, recordation, execution, and enforcement of money judgments in civil cases in the superior courts of this state shall be applicable to and govern the magistrate courts. 
(b)  Upon the issuance of any execution by the magistrate court, the clerk of the magistrate court shall immediately transmit a copy of the execution to the clerk of superior court of the county. The fee of the clerk of superior court for recording the execution on the general execution docket shall be charged and collected by the magistrate court contemporaneously with or prior to the issuance of the execution but not before the entry of judgment in the action; and such fee shall be transmitted by the clerk of magistrate court to the clerk of superior court together with the copy of the execution.

The principal and interest of such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund herein provided for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates as may be authorized by the authority, shall be payable semiannually, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding forty years from their date or dates, shall be payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority in the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds. Such revenue bonds or obligations shall be issued pursuant to, and in conformity with, the Revenue Bond Law, approved February 14, 1957 (1957 Ga. Laws, page 36), amending the law formerly known as the Revenue Certificate Law of 1937, approved March 31, 1937 (1937 Ga. Laws, page 761), as amended. All procedures pertaining to such issuance and the conditions thereof shall be the same as those contained in said Revenue Bond Law and any amendments thereto. 
Sec. 1-6-9. - Form, denominations, registration, place of payment. 
The authority shall determine the form of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form, or both. The authority may make provisions for the registration of any coupon bond, as to principal alone, or to both the principal and interest. 
Sec. 1-6-10. - Signatures; seal. 
In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds, or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon, shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the authority and attested by the secretary-treasurer of the authority, and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto. Any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of the chairman and secretary-treasurer of the authority. Any bond may be signed, sealed and attested on behalf of the authority by such persons as shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, at the actual time of the execution of such bonds, although such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office on the date of delivery and payment of such bonds. 
Sec. 1-6-11. - Negotiability, exemption from taxation. 
All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall have, and are hereby declared to have, all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the state. Such bonds are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose, and the said bonds, their transfer, and the income thereof shall be exempt from all taxation within the state. 
Sec. 1-6-12. - Sale, price. 
The authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the authority. 
Sec. 1-6-13. - Proceeds of bonds. 
The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may be issued in like manner to provide the amount of any deficit for the cost of the project or projects, which, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purposes. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into a sinking fund or used for additional construction as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture. 
Sec. 1-6-14. - Interim receipts and certificates or temporary bonds. 
Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority, under like restrictions, may issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter.

The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bond which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. 
Sec. 1-6-16. - Conditions precedent to issuance, object of issuance. 
Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified or required by this act. In the discretion of the authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular project. Any resolution, providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular, special or adjourned meeting of the authority by a majority vote of the quorum as provided in this act. 
Sec. 1-6-17. - Credit not pledged. 
Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Columbia County. Such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for, and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly or contingently obligate the said county to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for the payment of such bonds. All such bonds shall contain recitals on their face substantially covering the foregoing provisions of this section. 
Sec. 1-6-18. - Trust indenture as security. 
In the discretion of the authority any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the authority, including the proceeds derived from the sale of any surplus property of the authority, both real and personal. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the property, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies, including the proceeds derived from the sale of property of the authority, both real and personal, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other monies be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
Sec. 1-6-19. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
In the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, the authority shall provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank or trust company, which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this act and such resolutions or trust indentures may provide. 
Sec. 1-6-20. - Sinking fund. 
The revenues, fees, tolls and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued, and any monies derived from the sale of any properties, both real and personal, of the authority, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bond or the trust instrument may provide. Such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals, as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund. Said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payments of (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due; (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due; (3) the necessary charges of paying agent or agents for paying interest and principal; and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. The use and disposition of such sinking funds shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds, and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued. 
Sec. 1-6-21. - Remedies of bondholders. 
Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may protect and enforce, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the authority, or any office thereof, including the fixing, charging and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished. 
Sec. 1-6-22. - Refunding bonds. 
The authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issuance of revenue refunding bonds issued under the provisions of this act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon. The issuance of such revenue refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority in respect to the same shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this act insofar as the same may be applicable. 
Sec. 1-6-23. - Validation.

Such municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the validity of the terms thereof be determined and the contract or contracts adjudicated as security for the payment of any such bonds of the authority. The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds, against the authority issuing the same, and any municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality of the United States government if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the said Columbia County Airport Authority.

Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this act or any suit or action against such authority shall be brought in the superior court of Columbia County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall likewise be brought in said court, which shall have original jurisdiction of such actions. 
Sec. 1-6-25. - Interest of bondholders protected. 
While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties or existence of said authority or of its officers, employees or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will adversely affect the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency or authority shall be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this act shall be for the benefit of the state, the authority and the holders of any such bonds, and upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.

g.  Point of order. A motion on a point of order is always in order, but can be used only to present an objection to a ruling of the chairman or some matter of parliamentary procedure. After the mover has stated the objection, the chairman shall either sustain or deny the point of order raised. If the mover is not satisfied, he may appeal from the decision of the chairman. A majority or tie vote of those board of commissioners members voting sustains the decision of the chairman as to the point of order.

Whenever the amount of any tax, penalty or interest has been paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the county under sections 6-151—6-156, it may be offset as provided in subsection 6-154(c) or it may be refunded provided a verified claim in writing therefor, stating the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the director within three years from the date of payment. The claim shall be audited and shall be made on forms provided by the director. If the claim is approved by the director and the board of commissioners, the excess amount collected or paid may be refunded or may be credited on any amounts then due and payable from the person from whom it was collected or by whom paid, and the balance may be refunded to such person, his administrators or executors.

No. 13-06 states "Violations of this article shall be subject to penalties as outlined in section 1-9 of this Code. 

Sec. 18-242. - Purpose and administration. 
(a)  The primary purpose of this article is to enable rapid response to citizens and location of properties by law enforcement, fire, rescue, and emergency medical service personnel in Columbia County. Secondarily, this article serves to establish standardization of structure numbering to enhance county records of utility service, construction, permitting, licensing, and valuation. 
(b)  This article shall be administered by the individual/individuals, who shall be designated by the deputy county administrator, referred to herein as the "agency". The designated agent shall assign property numbers in accordance with the criteria outlined in chapter 18, article VII of the Code of Ordinances of Columbia County, Georgia (the "Code"). The agency will be responsible for maintaining official records of this article including, but not limited to, an alphabetical list of all roads with properties, listed in order of their assigned numbers.

(b)  The agency shall invite the involvement of the residents of affected areas in determining modified street numbers by public notice of such intent. However, nothing in this chapter shall be considered to usurp authority of the agency to make final decisions regarding the numbering system, numbers assigned, or compliance with this chapter without public involvement. 
(c)  Numbers shall be assigned along both sides of the road, with even numbers appearing on the left side of the road and odd numbers appearing on the right side of the road in the ascending direction. 
(d)  The following criteria shall govern the numbering system: 
(1)  All number origins shall begin from the intersection of the primary or secondary through or cross street. For dead-end roads or subdivision cul-de-sacs, numbering shall originate at the intersection of the adjacent road and terminate at the dead-end. 
(2)  The number assigned to the primary structure shall be the same number assigned to the real property in which the structure is situated. 
(3)  Every structure with more than one principle use or occupancy shall have a separate number for each use or occupancy. For example, duplexes will have two separate numbers. 
(4)  Apartments will have one property number followed by an apartment number based on the building number and apartment location within the building. For example, following the property number, building number one will be addressed with a one prefixing the apartment number, for example, 475 Belair Road, Apt. 101. 
(5)  On those streets accessed from either end, the property numbers shall originate from the end of the street carrying the greatest traffic volume. 
(6)  Notwithstanding the above, streets with the same name continuing into Columbia County from another municipality shall be numbered consistently based on beginning with the next consecutive number following the last number within the other municipality as feasible. 
(7)  Whenever any residence or other structure is constructed or developed, it shall be the responsibility of the new owner to obtain an assigned number from the agency.

(1)  Street line posting: The assigned number shall be displayed on a post, fence, wall, mailbox, or on some other structure with an approximate height of four feet at the property line adjacent to the access drive of the numbered structure. The exact height and location of the posting may vary in order to ensure that the sign remains unobstructed from view. The posted numbers shall be visible from both directions on the road.

(3)  Size and color of numbers: Properties used for residential purposes shall have posted numbers a minimum of three inches high.

No person, agency, or business shall adopt, assign, display, or cite any number other than that assigned as provided herein for the purpose of designating location of property. 
(5)  In residential instances where the property is located on a private drive where more than one residence is located, the assigned number must be posted on the main road. It must also be posted adjacent to the access drive of the property using the street line posting. 
(6)  In situations where a property is located on a private drive and has more than one structure or a structure with more than one principle use or occupancy, numbers should be posted using the structure posting, in addition to the posting requirements of subsection (5), set forth above. 
(7)  The owner, occupant, or person in charge of any house or building to which a number is assigned or modified shall be notified in writing of that assignment at any time after adoption of this article.

State of emergency is as defined by O.C.G.A. § 38-3-3(5), and means a condition declared by the governor when, in his judgment, the threat or actual occurrence of a disaster, emergency or energy emergency is of sufficient severity and magnitude as to warrant extraordinary efforts in preventing or alleviating the damage, loss, hardship or suffering threatened or caused thereby.

Sec. 30-56. - Purpose. 
The health, safety and welfare of the citizens and property of the county may be jeopardized during an emergency, disaster or the subsequent recovery period by the inability of the board of commissioners to act expediently without regard to certain formalities. The board of commissioners is authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 38-3-27(b) and 38-3-28 to take actions necessary to provide for the health and safety of persons and property during periods of emergency or disaster, provided that such actions are not inconsistent with any orders, rules or regulations promulgated by the governor of the state or his delegate. The powers and functions exercised by the board of commissioners necessary to conduct the business and affairs of the county during an emergency or disaster proclaimed as such by the appropriate state official may continue without regard to compliance with time consuming procedures and formalities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 38-3-54. In accordance with O.C.G.A. §§ 36-10-4(c)(5) and 32-4-63(6), certain formalities concerning public works contracts may be waived when necessitated by an emergency. The board of commissioners believes that it is desirable to have legislation in place authorizing the board of commissioners to waive certain formalities and procedures, as necessary, in case of an emergency, natural disaster or the subsequent recovery period.

4.  The fill shall be spread in a series of loose lifts, each not exceeding eight inches in thickness, and shall be compacted by sheepsfoot roller or other approved method after each layer is spread. The next lift shall not be placed until the compacted lift is tested or authorized by the soil testing agency. 
5.  The moisture content of the fill material shall be controlled at the time of spreading and compaction to obtain required relative compaction. 
6.  All fills shall be compacted to a minimum of 95 percent of maximum density as determined by A.S.T.M. D-1557 or other approved testing methods giving equivalent test results. If the required degree of relative compaction cannot be attained on sloped surfaces, the slope shall be over filled and cut back until the compacted inner core is exposed. Field density shall be determined by A.S.T.M. D-1556. 
7.  A sufficient number of tests shall occur to satisfy the soil testing agency that all requirements have been met. As a minimum, a field density test, as herein provided, shall be taken for each 18 inches of fill, or portion thereof, measured vertically from the lowest point of the area to be filled, and for each 500 cubic yards of fill placed. In addition, in the case of subdivisions, at least one field density test shall be taken on each lot which receives fill. One field density test shall be taken on the slope face for every four feet in elevation of the slope or every 1,000 square feet of slope for each lot. 
8.  All fills regulated by this Section shall be tested for relative compaction by a qualified soil testing agency. A certificate of compliance with the terms of this section and the grading permit, setting forth densities, relative compaction and other soil characteristics shall be prepared and signed by the soil testing agency. A compaction report shall be submitted to and approved by Columbia County before any final approval of the fill is given and before final platting of the subdivision. 
e.  All filled lots shall be denoted on the final plat, with reference made to the applicable compaction report.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 34-106. - Purpose. 
The county is authorized by the state constitution, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs I(a) and III(a)(6) thereof and state law to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, which services, systems and facilities contribute to the protection and preservation of the public health, safety and welfare, and protection of the natural resources of the county. The Federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 USC 1251 et seq.), other amendments and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the act, place increased emphasis on the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting and making available to its citizens and property owners stormwater management services which address water quality and volume impacts of stormwater runoff. The board of commissioners has determined that development in the county to date, and the outlook for continued development at an increasing rate in the future, has created and will continue to create a need for stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the county. The county has engaged a consultant to perform professional engineering and financial analyses of the county's stormwater management needs and the alternatives available to the county for dealing with stormwater management, and has received, reviewed and considered the results of the consultant's analyses which identify stormwater management needs, propose strategic program goals and priorities, estimate the cost of stormwater management services, systems and facilities, examine reasonable charges by the county for providing such services and facilities and project the rate base available within the county to support such costs. The board of commissioners finds and concludes from the professional engineering and financial analyses that it would be desirable to provide for additional stormwater management services, systems and facilities within certain more developed portions of the unincorporated areas of the county. The board of commissioners finds and concludes from the professional engineering and financial analyses that a fair and equitable rate structure for those receiving the benefits of stormwater management services, systems and facilities, the proceeds of which will be dedicated to the county stormwater utility for carrying out its purposes, will be essential if the county is to provide the level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities that would be desirable to meet the existing and future stormwater management needs of the county. 
(Ord. No. 00-6, § 1(a), 8-15-2000) 
Sec. 34-107. - Findings. 
The board of commissioners makes the following findings of fact: 
(1)  The professional engineering and financial analyses conducted on behalf of and submitted to the county assesses and defines the stormwater management issues, needs, goals, program priorities and operational opportunities of the county. 
(2)  Given the issues, needs, goals, priorities and operational opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the county, it is appropriate to authorize the establishment of an accounting unit which shall be dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities in the unincorporated areas of the county in concert with other water resource management programs. 
(3)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, but it will be appropriate to provide different levels of service in the urban and suburban areas in contrast to the rural areas. Urban and suburban area development in some portions of the county has altered the natural hydrology of such areas, with some natural elements having been replaced or augmented by manmade facilities. Other areas of the county remain less densely developed and rural in character, with natural stormwater drainage predominating, except along roads where ditches and culverts have been installed. As a result, the specific stormwater management services, systems and facilities needs differ from area to area in the unincorporated portions of the county. While the county manages, operates and improves certain stormwater management systems and facilities in the rural as well as urban and suburban areas, the need for improved stormwater management services, systems and facilities is greatest in the urban and suburban areas. A threshold level of stormwater management service, systems and facilities is needed countywide, but a higher level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities is needed in the urban and suburban areas. Therefore, at this time, a stormwater utility service area in which stormwater service and user charges would be made should encompass only those urban and suburban area portions of the unincorporated areas of the county wherein the immediate needs are greatest and it is feasible for the county to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities at a higher level. 
(4)  Given the need for a threshold level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities countywide, and a higher level of such services, systems and facilities in urban and suburban areas, it is equitable that the threshold level of such services, systems and facilities in all of the unincorporated areas of the county continue to be funded from the county's general tax revenues, and that the higher levels of stormwater management services, systems and facilities in the urban and suburban areas be funded by stormwater utility user fees and service charges on properties in such urban and suburban areas. The county should reimburse the stormwater utility fund from its general tax revenues for providing the threshold level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities countywide. 
(5)  The stormwater needs in the county include, but are not limited to, protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Provision of stormwater management services, systems and facilities and regulation of the use therefor renders and/or results in both service and benefit to individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the county, and to all properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the county concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses. 
(6)  The service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management services, systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations, including, but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed upon the stormwater management services, systems and facilities, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of properties in proportion to the longterm demands the properties owned impose on the county's stormwater management services, systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits to such properties and the owners thereof. 
(7)  The county presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed, installed and acquired through various mechanisms over many years. The future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the county, and of future additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the county to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use and enhance the stormwater management systems and facilities in the county in concert with the management and regulation of other water resources in the county. In order to do so, the county must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management services, systems and facilities. 
(8)  A stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the county, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities in the urban and suburban areas of the unincorporated portions of the county through stormwater service charges, user fees and other mechanisms as described in the professional engineering and financial analyses prepared for the county. 
(9)  A schedule of stormwater utility service charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the urban and suburban areas of the unincorporated area of the county. Such service charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the board of commissioners. 
(10)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the county stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the service charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit, and that such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the county engineer. Reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the property benefitted by such systems. 
(11)  The area of impervious surfaces on each property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services, systems and facilities provided by the county or to be provided by the county in the future, and that the area of impervious surfaces on each property is there for the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater service charge. 
(12)  It is imperative that the proceeds from all service charges for stormwater management services, systems and facilities, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems and facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and directs that such proceeds of service charges and revenues shall therefor be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the county stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and nonoperating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes. 
(Code 1979, § 2-6.1-30; Ord. No. 00-6, § 1(b)(2-6.1-30), 8-15-2000) 
Sec. 34-108. - Stormwater utility and enterprise fund established. 
(a)  There is established a stormwater utility to be known as the county stormwater utility, which shall be responsible for stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the unincorporated areas of the county, and which shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of the county's stormwater management services, systems and facilities. 
(b)  There is established a stormwater utility enterprise fund in the county budgeting and accounting systems for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the stormwater utility, including, but not limited to, rentals, rates, charges, fees and licenses, as may be established by the board of commissioners from time to time, and other funds that may be transferred or allocated to the stormwater utility. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater utility enterprise fund, and all expenses and capital investments of the stormwater utility shall be paid from the stormwater utility enterprise fund; provided, however, that other revenues, receipts and resources not accounted for in the stormwater utility enterprise fund may be applied to stormwater management services, systems and facilities as deemed appropriate by the board of commissioners. 
(c)  The board of commissioners shall place within the county stormwater utility department the responsibility for operation, maintenance and regulation of the existing stormwater management services, systems and facilities previously performed, owned and operated or maintained by the county, and other related assets, including, but not limited to, properties, other than road rights-of-way, upon which such stormwater management systems and facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access and certain equipment used solely for stormwater management. This responsibility shall be placed with the county stormwater utility department as the board of commissioners has determined that the county stormwater utility department has been sufficiently organized, staffed and funded to adequately carry out such responsibilities. The board of commissioners shall determine which division of the county's governing body organization to place the stormwater utility in, and the board of commissioners may move the stormwater utility to other divisions from time to time as it sees fit.

(c)  It is the express intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and welfare of people and property in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person, or to any specific property within or outside the boundaries of the county. The county expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages or equitable remedies upon the county, its commissioners, officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship. 
(d)  If any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the county as a condition precedent to any activity or change upon property not owned by the county pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of the county, or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit or negligent issuance of a permit, seeking the imposition of money damages or equitable remedies against the county, its commissioners, officers, employees or agents. 
(Code 1979, § 2-6.1-33) 
Sec. 34-111. - On-site systems and facilities; enforcement methods and inspections. 
(a)  Every owner of real property located in the unincorporated areas of the county, and every person which serves as a contractor for the purpose of developing real property located in the unincorporated areas of the county shall, as to the real property owned or being developed, provide, manage, maintain and operate on-site stormwater management systems and facilities sufficient to collect, convey, detain, control and discharge stormwater in a manner which is in compliance with all of the county ordinances, rules and regulations, the laws, rules and regulations of the state and the United States, and which, in any event, will not discharge stormwater in a manner which will flood, damage or otherwise harm property which is located downstream from the real property owned or being developed. A failure by an owner and/or developer to meet the obligations and requirements imposed by this article shall constitute a private nuisance and the parties damaged thereby or the county may bring an action to abate such nuisance. Any parties so damaged may include in such action a claim for the damages which such party has sustained. 
(b)  If any court of competent jurisdiction shall find that the failure of the owner and/or developer to meet the obligations and requirements imposed by this article constitutes a public nuisance, and the owner and/or developer fails to abate such nuisance within any time limit which the court might impose, the county may enter upon the property at issue and cause such work to be performed as is reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance, with the cost of such work to be charged to the owner and the developer, if any, on a joint and several basis.

(1)  Sediment which may alter natural systems, scouring vital habitat and smothering stream life; 
(2)  Increased bacteria which may pose a significant health risk; 
(3)  Excessive nutrients which may accelerate algal growth and eutrophication of receiving waters, adversely affecting flora and fauna; 
(4)  Pollutants and nutrients which may negatively affect vital habitat for fish, birds, wildlife and native plant communities; 
(5)  Metals which may be toxic to aquatic life; 
(6)  Oil and grease which may reduce oxygen levels; and 
(7)  Temperature of receiving waters may increase, which may adversely affect animal and plant habitat. 
(b)  Uncontrolled stormwater drainage may increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur, endangering roads, other public and private property and human life. 
(c)  Altered land surfaces may change the rate and volume of runoff which may result in the following: 
(1)  Streambanks may erode and slump, resulting in widening of streams; 
(2)  Tree root systems may be undercut; 
(3)  Erosion rates may increase; and 
(4)  Streambeds may become more uniform and shallow, providing less varied aquatic habitats. 
(d)  Adverse water quality and quantity consequences as set forth in this section could result in substantial economic losses. Potential losses include, but are not limited to, increased water treatment cost, as well as state and federal fines associated with water quality violations. 
(1)  Many future problems can be avoided through proper stormwater management. 
(2)  Every parcel of real property, both public and private, either uses or benefits from the maintenance of the county's storm sewer system.

(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals, or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Start of construction is the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are NOT exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally aboveground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, alteration or improvements to a structure, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. The market value of the structure should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the local code enforcement official, and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or any alteration of a historic structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state inventory of historic places provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this article. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(12)  Maintain all records pertaining to the provisions of this article, and such records shall be open for public inspection. 
The foregoing responsibilities may be performed or otherwise carried out by county employees or other appropriate designees of the administrator, as determined by the county administrator. 
(Ord. No. 14-05, § 1(Exh. A), 2-18-2014; Ord. No. 19-02, § 1(Exh. A), 3-5-2019 ) 
Sec. 42-44. - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
(a)  General standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
(2)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Anchoring methods may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top and/or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
(3)  New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
(4)  New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
(5)  Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
(6)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
(7)  New and replacement sanitary sewer systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; 
(8)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
(9)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which structure is not in compliance with the provisions of this article, shall not further or extend the non-conformity, and shall meet the requirements of new construction as contained in this article. 
(b)  Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard where basic flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in section 42-35 or subsection 42-43(9), the following standards are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than three feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (3) of this section. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than three feet above the level of the base flood elevation. Structures located in A1—30, AE, or AH zones may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated, provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. Furthermore, access to the nonresidential structure shall be constructed at an elevation equal to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that design and methods of construction are in accordance with the accepted standards of practice for meeting the standards of this subsection. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in section 42-42. 
(3)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor shall be designed as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. 
a.  Designs for complying with the requirement of this subsection (3) must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect, or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
b.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other utility connections shall be elevated a minimum of three feet above the base flood elevation. 
c.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises or entry to the elevated area. 
d.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
(4)  [Standards where data is available. ] Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than three foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than three foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement per subsection (2). 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (1), above. 
(5)  Floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-35 are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which can carry debris, potential projectiles and have erosion potential. The area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. The following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments unless certification, with supporting hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. 
b.  If the provisions of this subsection are satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section. 
(c)  Building standards for residential single-lot developments on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways. For a residential single-lot development not part of a subdivision, located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-35 where streams exist but where no base flood data have been provided, or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  The administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of the ordinance. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following subsections (2) and (3) shall apply: 
(2)  No encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be located within a distance of the stream bank equal to two times the width of the stream at the top of the bank, or 25 feet each side from the top of the bank, whichever is greater, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. In A-Zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed the lowest floor must be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (b)(2). 
a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
(4)  The administrator shall review and record the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(d)  Building standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). Areas of special flood hazard established in section 42-35, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (b)(2). 
The administrator shall review the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in section 42-43. 
(3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
(Ord. No. 14-05, § 1(Exh. A), 2-18-2014; Ord. No. 19-02, § 1(Exh. A), 3-5-2019 ) 
Sec. 42-45. - Standards for subdivision. 
(a)  Studied "A" zones, as identified in the FIS, shall be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available. 
(b)  The width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA approved flood study. If floodway data is not available, then it shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA. 
(c)  General standards. All subdivision and/or development proposals shall: 
(1)  Be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
(2)  Have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters and discharges from the systems in to floodwaters. 
(3)  Have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(4)  Provide access elevated to a minimum of one foot above the base flood elevation to residential developments. 
(5)  Provide access elevated to or above the base flood elevation to commercial developments. 
(6)  Have greater than 50 percent of each residential lot outside the limits of the special flood hazard area. In the R-A and R-1 zoning districts, the director or his/her designee may reduce the percentage of a residential lot that may be outside of the special flood hazard area, provided that the lot is of sufficient size and topography that the buildable area that remains outside the special flood hazard area is determined by the director or his/her designee to be adequate for the construction of the improvements proposed without subjecting them to unnecessary flooding risks. 
(7)  Provide the minimum lowest floor elevation for each residential lot encroached upon by the special flood hazard area. 
(8)  Provide base flood elevation data for all subdivision and other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, as determined from the FIS or a FEMA approved flood study. For subdivisions and other proposed development, including but not limited to manufactured home parks, containing land where no base flood data has been provided (A-Zone), which are either greater than 50 lots or greater than five acres, base flood elevations shall be developed using detailed methodologies for submittal to FEMA as a letter of map revision (LOMR). Prior to approval of the preliminary plat, the applicant shall submit a copy of the LOMR to the administrator for review and approval using the community consent forms. The applicant shall be responsible for forwarding the LOMR submittal package to FEMA. The LOMR must be approved by FEMA prior to the county's acceptance of the final plat. Any development activity conducted by the applicant prior to final LOMR approval by FEMA will be performed at the risk of the applicant. 
(9)  Any physical changes to the base floodplain shall be submitted and approved by FEMA as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable, prior to approval of the preliminary plat. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the administrator using the community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval from FEMA shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Prior to recording of the final plat, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys for a final letter of map revision (LOMR). 
(d)  Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of subsection 42-44(c) apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the State of Georgia and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the administrator prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within floodplain. Such study shall include: 
(1)  Description of the extent to which any floodway or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
(2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles; 
(3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all floodplain encroachments. 
(e)  Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (2) below. 
(2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and, 
(3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the administrator until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the administrator. 
(f)  Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The administrator may direct the property owner (at no cost to Columbia County) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the administrator. 
(Ord. No. 14-05, § 1(Exh. A), 2-18-2014; Ord. No. 19-02, § 1(Exh. A), 3-5-2019 ) 
Sec. 42-46. - Standard for critical facilities. 
(a)  Critical facilities shall not be located in the 100-year floodplain or the 500-year floodplain. 
(b)  All ingress and egress from any critical facility must be protected to the 500-year flood elevation. 
(Ord. No. 14-05, § 1(Exh. A), 2-18-2014; Ord. No. 19-02, § 1(Exh. A), 3-5-2019 ) 
Sec. 42-47. - Variance procedure/appeals. 
(a)  The county board of commissioners shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The board of commissioners shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of commissioners may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Columbia County Georgia, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places upon a determination that proposed repair or, rehabilitation will not result in the structure losing its historical designation and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such applications, the board of commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this article. 
(h)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board of commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

ARTICLE II. - PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL 

Sec. 74-36. - Generally. 
(a)  Review of subdivision plats helps to ensure that all subdivision and sale of land complies with the applicable requirements of the Columbia County Code of Ordinances. Review of a subdivision plat is required for any: 
(1)  Division of land into two or more lots; 
(2)  Recombination of two or more lots; 
(3)  Extension of public utilities (other than individual service lines) or other public facilities; 
(4)  Dedication of public right-of-way; 
(5)  Abandonment of existing public right-of-way; and 
(6)  Extension of public streets. 
(b)  Types of plats. There are two types of plats—Minor plats, approved by the director of planning services, and major plats, approved by the Columbia County Planning Commission. 
(1)  Minor plats. Plats meeting the following criteria are minor plats: 
a.  The subdivision will result in the creation of no more than four lots. 
b.  The subdivision does not require the extension of public utilities (other than individual service lines) or other public facilities. No substantial alteration of existing utility installations is involved. 
c.  The subdivision does not require the dedication of public right-of-way. 
d.  Each proposed lot meets the requirements of the Columbia County Code of Ordinances. 
e.  The subdivision meets the requirements of section 74-42, additional requirements for minor plats. 
(2)  Major plats. 
a.  A subdivision plat that is not a minor plat is considered a major plat. 
(c)  Major plats must be approved by the planning commission as follows: 
(1)  Submission of conceptual design . Early in the project and prior to any detailed design work, the prospective subdivider shall submit to the planning commission a conceptual design that illustrates how the proposed subdivision addresses existing site conditions, including topography, sensitive environmental and cultural features, and adjacent land uses, in accomplishing the overall development goals. Applicants or property owners proposing the subdivision of land that will not require a land disturbance permit are not required to submit for conceptual design approval. In making application for conceptual design approval, the prospective subdivider shall submit: 
a.  A survey of the existing site conditions, including existing topography, significant trees, waterways, wetlands, floodplains, and other environmentally sensitive features; existing structures, including any historic or cultural resources; utilities; and transportation facilities; and 
b.  A general land use plan illustrating proposed access points; street layout; approximate size and location of building types; recreational facilities; open space areas; and environmental protection areas. 
(2)  Submission of preliminary plat . Prior to making any street improvements or installing any utilities, the prospective subdivider shall submit to Columbia County a preliminary plat as specified in section 74-37 that meets the general layout and intent of the approved conceptual design, as well as the performance and maintenance bond required by section 74-45, and environmental bond required by section 34-70(b)(6). Where circumstances warrant, the planning commission may modify the requirements contained in this chapter in accordance with section 74-118. Approval of the preliminary plat by the planning commission constitutes authorization for the subdivider to develop the subdivision subject to the minimum standards for improvements set forth in article IV of this chapter, and the minimum standards of design set forth in article III of this chapter. 
(3)  Submission of final plat . After approval of the preliminary plat, the subdivider may proceed with the preparation of the final plat and other documents as may be required in connection therewith. A final plat, in accordance with section 74-38, may be approved by the planning commission at any point after approval of the preliminary plat, or concurrently, provided that the requirements of section 74-45 have been met. No building permits shall be issued prior to the written approval of the final plat and subsequent as-built drawings. 
(4)  Submission of plat of record . Upon approval of a final plat, the subdivider shall submit a plat of record prepared in accordance with section 74-39 to the planning commission for its approval. 
(5)  Submission of as-built drawings . Upon the completion of improvements, the subdivider shall submit to Columbia County engineered drawings that show the exact dimensions, geometry, and location of all elements of the work completed. 
(d)  Appeals. 
(1)  Minor plats. An applicant or property owner requesting minor plat approval may appeal the director's decision to the planning commission. A written request for appeal must be received within 15 days of the director's decision, and must specify the grounds for appeal. The director shall transmit to the planning commission all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken, and shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal. Planning commission shall render a decision within 30 days of receiving a request for appeal. If aggrieved by the planning commission's decision, an applicant or property owner may appeal to the board of commissioners. A request for appeal will follow the process as outlined in subsection (2) below. 
(2)  Major plats. An applicant or property owner requesting major plat approval may appeal the planning commission's decision to the board of commissioners. A written request for appeal must be received within 15 days of the planning commission's decision, and must specify the grounds for appeal. The planning commission shall transmit to the board of commissioners all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken, and shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal.

Sec. 74-42. - Additional requirements for minor plats. 
Where approval is sought for a plat which depicts the subdivision of a tract of land into not more than four lots or tracts of land, including the remaining portion of the original tract which shall be treated as one of the four lots, the following conditions must be met: 
(1)  The size and shape of each lot resulting from the subdivision must meet the minimum standards set forth in chapter 90 of this Code for the zoning district in which the land being subdivided is located, except that if the parent tract does not have 150 feet of public road frontage the subdivision may be approved if it provides access to the newly formed lots as described in subsection (2) below. 
(2)  Ingress and egress to each lot resulting from the subdivision is provided by an access road at least 30 feet in width fronting on a public road of not less than 30 feet in width, with a curb cut for the access road of not less than 18 feet in width. Such access road shall run back to some or all four of the lots in the subdivision by frontage on a private road of not less than 30 feet in width with the owners of the lots owning either fee simple title to, or a permanent easement over, a strip or strips of land not less than 30 feet in width which permanent easement or fee simple strip may be exclusive to one or more of the lots or non-exclusive for use by all of the lots; provided that all of the lots must have the required ingress and egress. Such fee simple title or permanent easement shall not serve land not included in the subdivision as shown on the plat. Under no circumstances shall there be more than two access roads serving the lots in the subdivision. The topography of such 30-foot wide strip or strips of land must be suitable for the construction and maintenance of an access road to the lots being served, and it must not be burdened with improvements, easements or other encumbrances that would interfere with its use as a right-of-way for an access road. Any access road serving the lots must consist of dirt, gravel or a higher grade paving surface at least 18 feet in width. The access road can be maintained on a surface of dirt except at the point where the access road intersects the public road where the paving of the access road must consist at least of gravel from the edge of the paved county road to the right-of-way line of the county road in order to protect the paving of the county road. 
(3)  If the deed or deeds to any of the lots do not provide for maintenance and repair of the access road(s) in accordance with the requirements set forth herein, then the cost of maintenance and repair of the access road(s) must be paid in equal shares by the owners of each of the lots depicted on the plat, and each such owner shall be responsible for seeing that such maintenance and repair is performed. If the county engineer, in his/her discretion, is satisfied that all of the conditions of this section have been met, then the plat may be submitted by the county engineer to the planning commission for approval or in those situations where permitted, to a licensed surveyor for certification. Columbia County shall not be responsible for construction, repair or maintenance of any access road unless the county has accepted ownership of the road in accordance with all requirements which have been established by the county. 
(4)  Any plat or map for which approval is sought under this section 74-42 of the Code must meet the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 15-6-67 in order that the clerk of superior court shall file and record in his/her office such maps and plats in the county. This will require approval by the county planning commission unless there is an exemption under [O.C.G.A.] § 15-6-67(d). 
(5)  Changes to plats depicting four lots or less must be made in accordance with the requirements set forth in subsection 74-40(4) of the Code. 
(6)  Lots or tracts of land resulting from the subdivision of land as depicted on a plat approved under this section, including the remaining portion of the original tract, may not be further subdivided under the provisions of this section for a period of five years after the date of the recording of the plat. If the original tract is subdivided into less than four lots as shown on the plat for which approval is sought, then the original tract may at a later date be subdivided further but only up to a grand total of not more than four lots being subdivided out of the original tract, including the original tract; provided that these subsequently subdivided lots may not be further subdivided for a period of five years after the date of the recording of the plat depicting their subdivision. The term "original tract," as used in this section, shall mean the entire tract of land as it existed immediately prior to the subdivision of any portion of such tract of land as depicted on the plat for which approval is being sought.

(1)  Private roads and the rights-of-way therefor are constructed and maintained in accordance with the requirements of this Code and minimum specifications therefor, as promulgated from time to time by the board of commissioners. 
(2)  Fee simple title to the rights-of-way for the roads are vested in the owners of the lots abutting such private roads, or a nonprofit state corporation of which all owners of lots having a right to use the roads are required by covenants running with the land to be members (referred to in this section as the "owner's association"). 
(3)  Private roads are subject to a perpetual easement for ingress and egress to all of the lots in the subdivision, which easement shall be appurtenant to and pass with title to the lots in the subdivision. 
(4)  Owner's association shall, by covenants running with the land recorded in the office of the clerk of superior court, have the obligation to maintain the private roads and rights-of-way therefor in a good, safe and well-kept condition, and shall be required to levy annual assessments on lots in the subdivision to pay the cost thereof, and to establish and maintain reasonable reserves for future significant repair, rebuilding, repaving and maintenance of such roads, not required on an annual basis, which assessments, if unpaid, when due, become and continue to be a lien on the lot against which they were levied until they are paid. 
(b)  A subdivision of land creating lots fronting on private roads shall require approval of a preliminary plat and a final plat as set forth in this chapter for subdivisions using public roads, which shall be filed with the engineering services department for processing and consideration by the planning and zoning commission and the board of commissioners if any of the improvements located in such subdivision are to be dedicated to the county. At the time of the filing of the plat for preliminary approval, the owner of the land shall also file all legal instruments, including, but not limited to, grants of easements, declarations of covenants and articles of incorporation and bylaws of the owner's association, to be reviewed by the county attorney to determine if all of the requirements of subsection (a)(2), (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section have been met. At the time of requesting final plat approval, a copy of the signed documents, with all exhibits attached, together with a certificate of incorporation for the owner's association from the secretary of state and a copy of the minutes of the organizational meeting of the owner's association certified by its secretary must be furnished to the county attorney for review. 
(c)  Subdivisions containing more than four lots, but not more than 12 lots, including the remaining portion of the original tract, access to which is provided by private roads, shall, at a minimum, provide access to the lots by not more than two private roads which must be at least 18 feet in width located within a right-of-way of not less than 30 feet in width, and built and paved in accordance with specifications established by the board of commissioners. If a subdivision is developed and access provided pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, the lots resulting from such subdivision, including the remaining portion of the original tract, may not be further subdivided without meeting all of the requirements of articles III and IV of this chapter for the development of subdivisions. Any subdivision containing more than 12 lots, access to which is provided by private roads, shall provide access to the lots by roads meeting all of the requirements of articles III and IV of this chapter for the development of subdivisions; provided, however, that if all of the lots in the subdivision are five acres or larger, the streets do not have to be paved, but must meet all other development construction standards. If all lots in the subdivision are 2.5 acres or larger, concrete curbs and gutters are not required. The term "original tract," as used in this subsection, means the entire tract of land as it existed immediately prior to the subdivision of any portion thereof as depicted on the plat for which approval is being sought. 
(d)  An appropriate permanent sign identifying the roads in the subdivision as private roads must be erected by the developer and maintained in good condition by the owner's association or the developer at all locations where private roads intersect with public roads. 
(e)  Subdivisions developed with the use of private roads must, except as specifically otherwise provided in this chapter, comply with all other requirements of this Code dealing with or relating to the subdivision of land and the construction of improvements on such land. 
(f)  No plat of a subdivision of land utilizing private roads for ingress and egress to the lots contained in such subdivision shall be approved unless it is in full compliance with the requirements of this section, unless a variance from any such requirement is granted by the board of commissioners. 
(Code 1979, § 2-13-25) 
Sec. 74-44. - Reserved. 
Sec. 74-45. - Performance and maintenance bond. 
(a)  A performance and maintenance bond, letter of credit, cash bond, or other equivalent form of security as approved by the county attorney, running in favor of the county, in a minimum amount of $5,000.00 or any amount equal to at least 30 percent of the actual construction cost of all improvements to be dedicated to the county, whichever is greater, shall be posted with the county by all subdividers or persons where street or other improvements are made and offered to the county for acceptance and maintenance except as noted in this section. The performance and maintenance bond, cash bond, letter of credit or other equivalent form of security shall guarantee all improvements against defects in design, material and workmanship and further guarantee that all such improvements shall be installed and maintained in first class condition for the required period and faithful performance by the subdivider or other person of all provisions of this chapter. 
(1)  Any bond, except cash bond, or letter of credit or other equivalent form of approved security shall be on forms supplied by the county and shall not be terminated or otherwise allowed to expire prior to the satisfactory completion of the maintenance period under section 74-46, or until released by the board of commissioners. Such bond, cash bond, letter of credit or other equivalent form of approved security along with evidence of payment of the required premiums shall be filed with the county. 
(2)  Such bond, cash bond, letter of credit or other equivalent form of security shall be posted prior to commencement of construction. No preliminary plat shall be approved or recorded by the county and no construction shall commence until and unless a satisfactory bond is posted. 
(3)  Separate bonds required by this section shall be required for each subdivision unit, phase or like entity approved by the county pursuant to this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 16-19 , § 1(Exh. A), 6-7-2016) 
Sec. 74-46. - Maintenance. 
(a)  All subdivisions in which subdivider intends to dedicate all, or a portion of, the improvements located thereon to the county shall meet the requirements of this section. The subdivider shall maintain and repair all improvements, other than water and sewer, dedicated to the county for two years, unless extended pursuant to this section, from the date of written acceptance of the as-built drawings. The subdivider shall pay the reasonable costs for the county to maintain and repair all dedicated water and sewer improvements for two years, unless extended pursuant to this section. 
(1)  The subdivider shall request in writing that the county inspect the development at least 60 days prior to the expiration of the maintenance period. Failure to notify the county in writing shall extend the maintenance period until inspection is requested and all determined improvements are made. 
(2)  If upon inspection as provided in subsection (1) of this section, the county determines that work or repairs are needed in order for the improvements to meet county specifications or requirements under this chapter, the subdivider shall be notified in writing by the department of the deficiencies, failure to comply or violations. Thereafter, for deficiencies, failure to comply or violations related to improvements other than water and sewer, the subdivider shall extend the maintenance bond one year and shall have 60 days from receipt of such notification to correct such deficiencies, noncompliance or violations. If the deficiencies, noncompliance or violations are not corrected within such time, then the maintenance bond, cash bond, letter of credit or equivalent form of approved security posted by the subdivider shall be, if approved by the board of commissioners, forfeited and called upon up to the cost of the repairs or the total amount of the bond. Should the amount of the bond be inadequate to pay for the cost of correcting the deficiencies, noncompliance or violations, then the subdivider shall pay any and all costs beyond bond coverage. For deficiencies, failure to comply or violations related to water and sewer, the subdivider shall pay the county the reasonable cost to correct the same. 
(3)  The subdivider shall pay to the county for each inspection, subsequent to the initial inspection provided under subsection (1) of this section, a reinspection fee in an amount set from time to time by resolution of the board of commissioners to defray the cost of reinspection. 
(4)  The maintenance period shall continue until such time as the county has inspected and accepted the improvements in writing. 
(5)  If a period of 30 months elapses from the commencement of the maintenance period for any subdivision and defects, noncompliance or violations still exist to the extent that the subdivision has not been accepted by the county, the county is authorized to withhold the issuance of any and all permits or to refuse inspection to subdivider on the project in dispute and any other project in which the subdivider, or officer or owner thereof, has a financial interest.

ARTICLE III. - GENERAL STANDARDS AND MINIMUM STANDARDS OF DESIGN 

Sec. 74-76. - Suitability of land. 
(a)  Land physically unsuitable for subdivision. The planning commission has found the following land to be unsuitable for development: 
(1)  Land which is subject to flooding, bad drainage, steep slopes, rock formations or other such features which may endanger health, life or property, aggravate erosion, increase flood hazard or necessitate excessive expenditures of public funds for supply and maintenance of services; and 
(2)  Land which other public agencies concerned have investigated and found, in the best interest of the public, not suitable for the type of platting and development proposed; 
such lands shall not be approved for subdivision unless adequate methods are formulated by the developer for meeting the problems created by subdivision of such land. 
(b)  Land unsuitably located for subdivision. The planning commission shall not approve what it considers to be scattered or premature subdivi-sion of land which would endanger health, safety or property because of lack of or adverse effect on water supply, schools, proper drainage, good transportation, other public services or public funds for the supply or maintenance of such services. 
(Code 1979, § 2-13-30) 
Sec. 74-77. - Name of subdivision. 
The name of each subdivision must have the approval of the planning commission. The subdivision name shall not duplicate nor closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision. 
(Code 1979, § 2-13-31) 
Sec. 74-78. - Street classifications. 
Streets and roads are classified in the county growth management plan according to the function that they are to serve the type, speed and volume of traffic they will carry, and the required standards of design. The classifications of streets and roads as used in this chapter shall be as follows: 
(1)  Primary arteries; 
(2)  Secondary arteries; 
(3)  Collector streets; and 
(4)  Land service streets. 
The designation in the county growth management plan of arterials and collectors shall not prevent other streets proposed in or adjoining subdivisions from being similarly classified. For the purposes of this chapter, land service streets are further classified by street design and use. Street classifications and subclassifications are as follows: 
(1)  Primary arteries—(PA) 
(2)  Secondary arteries—(SA) 
(3)  Collector streets—(CS) 
(4)  Land service streets—(LS) 
a.  Residential: 
1.  Small lot subdivisions (lots less than 50,000 square feet). 
2.  Large lot subdivisions (lots larger than 50,000 square feet with a minimum frontage of 125 feet). 
3.  Rural subdivisions (lots larger than 2.5 acres). 
4.  Large lot rural subdivisions (lots larger than 5.0 acres). 
b.  Industrial. 
c.  Commercial. 
d.  Service drive.

Sec. 74-79. - Relation to present, proposed and future street system. 
(a)  Location and width of streets and roads. The location and width of all streets and roads shall conform to the official major road plan as adopted by the planning commission. 
(b)  Connection of at least one existing street: At least one connecting street that terminates at, adjoins, or traverses a proposed subdivision and which will be used to provide access to the subdivision shall be a paved road not later than the approval of final plat for the first phase of the subdivision. If such access road is not a paved road it must be paved continuously in a manner meeting all of the requirements of this article from the nearest paved road on the public road system of the county, any adjoining county, any municipality located within the county or of the State of Georgia to at least one subdivision entrance. However, for those subdivisions that are creating lots under the provisions of section 74-42 of the Code, plats depicting subdivisions of four lots or less, and for those subdivisions that are creating lots larger than 15 acres under section 74-43 of the Code, subdivisions with private roads, at least one public road providing access to the subdivision shall be improved at least to the same standard as is required within the proposed subdivision from the nearest paved road on any of the public road systems described immediately above. 
(c)  Layout of new streets: The proposed street system within a subdivision shall be determined by the planning commission to adequately balance the privacy of the future occupants with the free flow of traffic within the county, and to adequately provide for access for public safety by fire, police and emergency medical vehicles, and for school buses. In making such determination, satisfaction of the following requirements shall be considered by the planning commission: 
(1)  In the opinion of the planning commission where it is necessary to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedication and improvement of right-of-way to the boundary of such property. 
(2)  Unless approved otherwise by the planning commission, a subdivision shall provide a street connection to each public street that it adjoins, and shall provide direct or indirect continuity through the subdivision between each connection. 
(3)  The proposed street layout should be designed to minimize cut and fill within the right-of-way to provide better access to the subdivision lots. The design should also minimize the area of tree removal required for installation of streets, utilities and drainage features in order to reduce the number of large trees removed during construction. 
(4)  To the greatest extent practical, cul-de-sacs should be avoided in favor of loop streets or a curvilinear or grid system of streets. 
(d)  Reverse frontage lots: 
(1)  Except in the R-A Residential-Agricultural district reverse frontage lots shall be provided along all arterial and collector roads abutting a residential subdivision unless the planning commission specifically determines that the provision of such lots would create an unusual and burdensome hardship on the property owner due to topographic or dimensional disadvantages of the property. Reverse frontage lots shall not be required in the R-A Residential-Agricultural district where lots are platted with road frontage widths greater than 150 feet and driveways are separated by more than 300 feet unless the planning commission determines that limiting access to the collector or arterial street is necessary for safety reasons. 
(2)  An easement shall be provided to the county extending along the entire line of reverse frontage across which there shall be no right of access as follows: 
a.  Equal in depth to the minimum front building setback required by the zoning district. Within the easement existing vegetation shall remain or shall be supplemented or replaced by additional planting to provide substantial natural screening between the lots and the arterial and collector roads. Existing trees with ten inches diameter at breast height (dbh) or greater shall not be removed unless removal is approved by the county to prevent danger due to injury or disease to the tree; or 
b.  No less than 25 feet in depth and in accordance with the provisions and requirements of section 90-139, buffer requirements, of the zoning ordinance. Existing trees with ten inches diameter at breast height (dbh) or greater shall not be removed unless removal is approved by the county to prevent danger due to injury or disease to the tree. 
(3)  All buffer and landscaping treatments are subject to the review and approval of the planning commission. Modifications may be approved by the planning commission to achieve equivalent screening results, depending on the topography, orientation or other physical factors of the site. 
(e)  Interval of intersection with arteries. Subdivision streets which intersect an artery shall do so at intervals not less than the following: 
(1)  Limited access primary artery, 1,200 feet; 
(2)  Other primary artery, 800 feet; and 
(3)  Secondary artery, 400 feet. 
(f)  Large parcels. When land is subdivided into parcels larger than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so as to allow for the opening of streets in the future, and for logical resubdivision.

_____
(b)  Vertical alignment of streets. 
(1)  Grades on arteries, collectors and industrial land service streets shall not exceed seven percent; grades on commercial land service streets shall not exceed ten percent; grades on residential land service streets shall not exceed 13 percent; all curbed and paved raised edge streets shall have a minimum grade of one percent. 
(2)  All changes in grade shall be connected by a vertical curve constructed so as to afford a minimum sight distance, which shall be measured from the driver's eyes, which are assumed to be 3¾ feet above the pavement surface, to an object six inches high on the pavement. The minimum sight distance shall be the minimum stopping sight distance for the rated speed of the street as follows: 

 
(c)  Horizontal alignment of streets. Where a deflection angle of more than ten degrees in the alignment of a street occurs, the radius of curvature of the centerline of such street shall be not less than the following: 

 
* The planning commission may approve a 50-foot curvature to make more efficient use of land. 
(1)  A tangent of at least 100 feet in length shall be introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. 
(2)  Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than the minimum stopping sight distance set forth in this section of the street intersected shall not be allowed. 
(3)  All streets shall intersect at right angles. Such intersecting streets shall continue as perpendicular from the center point of the intersection for not less than the minimum stopping sight distance for their respective rated speeds in accordance with this section. 
(4)  Right-of-way lines at street intersections shall have a radius of curvature of not less than 20 feet. Wherever necessary to permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radius without curtailing the sidewalk at a street corner to less than normal width, the street right-of-way line at such street corner shall be rounded or otherwise set back sufficiently to permit such construction. 
(d)  Reserved. 
(e)  Service drives. Service drives or alleys shall be provided to the rear of all lots used for business purposes, and shall not be provided in residential blocks, except where the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of the need for alleys or service drives, such as subdividing adjacent to an artery, or where specifically required by the planning commission. 
(f)  Culs-de-sac. Culs-de-sac shall not be more than 700 feet long unless necessitated by topographic or other conditions and approved by the planning commission. Such streets shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of at least 80 feet, and a street right-of-way diameter of at least 100 feet. 
(g)  Street names. Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with others already existing and named shall bear the names of existing streets. In no case shall the name for a proposed street duplicate existing street names, irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, boulevard, road, pike, drive, way, place, court or other derivatives. The planning commission can assist the subdivider in avoiding duplication and in coordinating the names of streets within the subdivision through its index list of street names and guides for naming and suffixing. 
(Code 1979, § 2-13-34) 
Sec. 74-81. - Blocks. 
(a)  Length. Blocks shall not be less than 400 feet, nor more than 1,200 feet in length, except as the planning commission considers necessary to secure efficient use of land or desired features of street patterns. In blocks greater than 800 feet in length, the planning commission may require at locations it deems necessary one or more public crosswalks of not less than ten feet in width to extend entirely across the block, or pedestrian easements in lieu thereof. (See section 74-83.) 
(b)  Width. Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two rows of lots, except where reverse frontage on major streets is provided or when prevented by topographic conditions or size of property or location next to an artery, in which case, the planning commission may approve a single row of lots. 
(Code 1979, § 2-13-36) 
Sec. 74-82. - Lots. 
(a)  Adequate building sites. Each lot shall contain a building site not subject to flood or periodic inundation. 
(b)  Arrangement. Each lot must abut a public street or road. Side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines, where practical. 
(c)  Minimum lot dimensions and areas. 
(1)  The size and shape of lots shall meet the minimum standards set forth in the county's zoning regulations, chapter 90 of this Code, and orientation of lots shall be such as the planning commission deems appropriate for the use contemplated, type of water supply and sewage disposal, soil characteristics, improvements and relation to the street system. 
(2)  The minimum depths of building setback lines for lots platted for all purposes shall be subject to the provisions of the county zoning regulations, chapter 90 of this Code, as well as the following: 
a.  Wherever fill is proposed to raise land, the building setback line shall be located not less than 25 feet from the outer edge of the fill. 
b.  To prevent infringement of sight lines at intersections, the setback distances for corner lots shall be based on the minimum stopping sight distances for automobiles approaching the intersection as set forth in section 74-80. The building setback line for the corner lot shall not be closer to the street right-of-way line than that line which connects the two points located on the centerlines of the two streets, the prescribed minimum stopping sight distance from the center of the intersection. 
(3)  Properties reserved or platted for commercial or industrial purposes shall be adequate in size to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated. Platting of individual lots should be avoided in favor of an overall design of the land to be used for such purposes. Land shall not be platted for commercial or industrial purposes unless the subdivider can demonstrate to the planning commission: 
a.  A site arrangement that prevents undue interference with through traffic. Each industrial subdivision or area shall utilize a single collector for all heavy traffic between the area and the general system of streets and roads. Industrial streets and individual industrial parcels shall be oriented at right angles with the collector and with adjacent railroads; 
b.  An on-site parking area; 
c.  An insulation against any adverse effects on any present or future adjacent residences; and 
d.  A parcel size sufficient in area to allow future expansion. 
(d)  Double and reverse frontage lots. 

Double and Reverse Frontage Lots 
(1)  Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided except where specifically required by the planning commission to provide separation of residential development from arterial and collector roads or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation of property. 
(2)  Reverse frontage lots shall be provided along all arterial and collector roads abutting a residential subdivision unless the planning commission specifically determines that the provision of such lots would create an unusual and burdensome hardship on the property owner due to topographic or dimensional disadvantages of the property. 
(3)  An easement to the county extending along the entire frontage, across which there shall be no right of access, and screening shall be provided along the line of reverse frontage lots abutting such arterial and collector roads, as follows: 
a.  In the R-A, residential-agricultural zoning district, the easement shall be equal in width to the minimum front building setback required by such zoning district. Within the easement, the existing vegetation shall be left undisturbed, but may be supplemented with additional plantings. 
b.  In all other residential zoning districts, the easement and screening shall be established as a buffer in accordance with the provisions and requirements of section 90-139 of this Code. The width of the buffer/easement for a natural buffer shall not be less than the minimum front building setback required by the zoning district in which it is located, or not less than 25 feet in width for a structural buffer if it creates an opaque screen to a height of not less than six feet. 
c.  All buffer and landscaping treatments are subject to the review and approval of the planning commission. Modifications may be approved by the planning commission to achieve equivalent screening results depending on the topography, orientation or other physical factors of the site.

Where a subdivision abuts an existing state or county road, the developer shall be required to improve such road so that it will comply with the minimum requirements of this chapter. 
(7)  Preparation and development of new streets. The preparation and development of all new streets shall comply with the county's specifications, and shall be approved by the county engineer before such streets may be developed and accepted by the county engineer and board of commissioners before final plat approval will be issued by the planning commission. 
(8)  Turn lanes. Turn lanes may be required at all entrances to subdivisions and industrial and commercial developments which front on arterial and collector streets. Turn lanes shall be 12 feet in width, plus curb and gutter, for a minimum distance of 200 feet, which distance shall be measured from the intersection of the right-of-way lines. 
(d)  Sidewalks. Sidewalks may be required where deemed by the planning commission as an integral part of a pedestrian traffic system within a one-mile radius of existing or planned schools, neighborhood recreation or commercial areas or other public places. Where provided, sidewalks shall be located not less than one foot from the property line to prevent interference or encroachment by fencing, walls, hedges or other plantings or structures placed on the property line at a later date. 
(e)  Sanitary sewerage. In the areas of the county designated for sewerage service in the master sewerage plan prepared by the county engineer, all subdivision developers shall be required to install a sanitary sewerage collection system. The layout and specifications of the system shall be in accordance with the master sewerage plan and other applicable county specifications, and shall require the approval of the county engineer. Where sanitary sewerage collection systems are not specifically required by the county engineer, all lots shall contain adequate area for the installation and safe operation of approved septic tanks and disposal fields, and must be approved by the county health officer and other agencies having jurisdiction over such matters. 
(f)  Public water systems. Each subdivision developer shall be required to provide a potable water supply subject to the approval of the county health officer. Where specifically required by the county engineer, each subdivision developer shall provide the subdivision service from the county water system. Any water lines or mains that are installed by any person which are to be attached to the water system of the county shall be constructed in accordance with county specifications and approved by the county engineer. 
(g)  Site improvements. Banks which infringe on sight lines at intersections (see section 74-82(c)(2)) shall be appropriately graded to correct the deficiency. Wherever grading or filling occurs on lots within the subdivision, the subdivider shall first stockpile the topsoil from the affected areas immediately after grading and filling, and shall redistribute to areas of disturbed soil, sufficient topsoil to support growth of lawn grass and other vegetation, and shall immediately seed such areas with appropriate vegetative cover to prevent erosion, silting of streams and other damages. Due regard shall be shown for such desirable trees which are already on the site, and grading and filling should be planned to preserve as many of such trees possible; however, no retained planting shall infringe on sight lines at intersections. If trees are planted by the subdivider, they shall be located five feet inside or behind property lines where they are less subject to injury, decrease the chances of motor accidents and enjoy more favorable conditions for growth. If trees are to be planted within a planting strip in the right-of-way, the proposed locations and species of such trees to be used must be submitted for the planning commission's approval since the public inherits the care and maintenance of such trees. The planning commission will assist the subdivider in location of trees and species to use under varying conditions. Where land is platted or reserved for commercial or industrial use bordering and across minor streets from residential lots, a suitable buffer planting of trees and shrubs which are approved by the planning commission shall be required, and such trees and shrubs shall not infringe on sight lines at intersections where planted. 
(h)  Street name signs. Appropriate street signs add sales value to land subdivisions and enable strangers, delivery concerns and potential lot buyers to find their way around. Street name signs of a type approved by the county shall be placed at all intersections.

If the permit official fails to render a decision within seven calendar days of receipt, any required permit is waived. A notice of denial or revocation shall clearly set forth in writing the grounds upon which the permit was denied or revoked and, where feasible, shall contain a proposal for measures by which the applicant may cure any defects in the application or otherwise procure a permit.

(f)  Requirements. 
(1)  Columbia County Water Utility. 
a.  On new installations, the Columbia County Water and Sewer Services will provide on-site evaluation and/or inspection of plans in order to determine the type of backflow preventer, if any, that will be required, will issue permit, and perform inspection and testing. In any case, a minimum of a double check valve with a wye strainer will be required in any new commercial construction and a minimum of a dual check on any residential. 
b.  For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the Columbia County Water and Sewer Services will perform evaluations and inspections of plans and/or premises and inform the owner by letter of any corrective action deemed necessary, the method of achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the correction to be made. Ordinarily, 90 days will be allowed, however, this time period may be shortened depending upon the degree of hazard involved and the history of the device(s) in question. 
c.  The Columbia County Water and Sewer Services will not allow any cross-connection to remain unless it is protected by an approved backflow preventer for which a permit has been issued and which will be regularly tested to insure satisfactory operation. 
d.  If the Columbia County Water and Sewer Services determines at any time that a serious threat to the public health exists, the water service will be terminated immediately. 
e.  The Columbia County Water and Sewer Services shall have on file, a list of private contractors who are certified backflow device testers. All charges for these tests will be paid by the owner of the building or property. 
f.  The Columbia County Water and Sewer Services requires all reduced pressure principle devices and double check valve backflow preventers include the installation of strainers located immediately upstream of the backflow device. The installation of strainers will preclude the fouling of backflow devices due to both foreseen and unforeseen circumstances occurring to the water supply system such as water main repairs, water main breaks, fires, periodic cleaning, and flushing of mains, etc. These occurrences may "stir up" debris within the water main that will cause fouling of backflow devices installed without the benefit of strainers. 
(2)  Owner. 
a.  The owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection of all cross-connections on his premises. 
b.  The owner, after having been informed by a letter from the department, shall at his expense, install, maintain, and test, or have tested, any and all backflow preventers on his premises. 
c.  The owner shall correct any malfunction of the backflow preventer which is revealed by periodic testing. 
d.  The owner shall inform the Columbia County Water and Sewer Services of any proposed or modified cross-connections and also any existing cross-connections of which the owner is aware but has not been found by the department. 
e.  The owner shall not install a bypass around any backflow preventer unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the bypass. Owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the device(s) must supply additional devices necessary to allow testing to take place. 
f.  The owner shall install backflow preventers in a manner approved by the Columbia County Water Utility. 
g.  The owner shall install only backflow preventers approved by the Columbia County Water and Sewer Services or the EPD. 
h.  Any owner having a private well or other private water source, must have a permit if the well or source is cross-connected to the Columbia County Water Utility's system. Permission to cross-connect may be denied by the Columbia County Water Utility. The owner may be required to install a backflow preventer at the service entrance if a private water source is maintained, even if it is not cross-connected to the Columbia County Water Utility's system. 
i.  In the event the owner installs plumbing to provide potable water for domestic purposes which is on the Columbia County Water Utility's side of the backflow preventer, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer installed. 
j.  The owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for permits, annual or semi-annual device testing, retesting in the case that the device fails to operate correctly, and second re-inspections for non-compliance with the Columbia County Water Utility. 
(g)  Degree of hazard. The Columbia County Water and Sewer Services recognizes the threat to the public water system arising from cross-connections. All threats will be classified by degree of hazard and will require the installation of approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention devices or double check valves. 
(h)  Permits. The Columbia County Water and Sewer Services shall not permit a cross-connection within the public water supply system unless it is considered necessary and that it cannot be eliminated. 
(1)  Cross-connection permits that are required for each backflow prevention device are obtained from the Columbia County Water Utility. 
(2)  Permits shall be renewed annually and are non-transferable. Permits are subject to revocation and become immediately revoked if the owner should so change the type of cross-connection or degree of hazard associated with the service. 
(3)  An initial inspection permit is required on new residential dual check backflow preventer. 
(i)  Existing in-use backflow prevention devices. Any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the Columbia County Water and Sewer Services to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer, or result in an unreasonable risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard has increased, an in the case of a residential installation converting to a business establishment, any existing backflow preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure principle device, or a reduced pressure principle device must be installed in the event that no backflow device was present. 
(j)  Periodic testing. 
(1)  All backflow devices shall be tested and inspected at least annually. 
(2)  Testing must be performed by licensed backflow tester approved by the State of Georgia. 
(3)  Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test will be repaired or replaced at owner's expense. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of the repair the device will be retested at owner's expense to insure correct operation. High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately. In other situations, a compliance date of not more than 30 days after the test date will be established. The owner is responsible for spare parts, repair tools, or a replacement device. Parallel installation of two devices is an effective means of the owner insuring that uninterrupted water service during testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires such continuity. Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than specified in subsection (1), above, in cases where there is a history of test failures and the Columbia County Water and Sewer Services feels that due to the degree of hazard involved, additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional tests will be borne by the owner.

(b)  The director shall deny or condition new or increased contributions of pollutants to the POTW by industrial users where such contributions do not meet applicable pretreatment standards and requirements, or where such contributions would cause the county to violate its NPDES permit. 
(Code 1979, § 2-7-66) 
Sec. 86-158. - Reports of potential problems. 
(a)  Any discharge, including, but not limited to, an accidental discharge, a discharge of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW that may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to human health and welfare or to the environment, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the director of the incident. Such notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(b)  Within five days following a discharge as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, the user shall, unless waived by the director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge, and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
(c)  A notice shall be permanently posted on a user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call if a discharge as set forth in subsection (a) of this section occurs. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(Code 1979, § 2-7-67) 
Sec. 86-159. - Reports from unpermitted users.

(Code 1979, § 2-7-68) 
Sec. 86-160. - Notification of violation; repeat sampling and reporting. 
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation of this article, the user must notify the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results thereof to the director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user may not be required to resample if the director monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the director samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of such sampling. 
(Code 1979, § 2-7-69) 
Sec. 86-161. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(a)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous wastes shall notify the POTW, the EPA's regional waste management division director and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA's hazardous waste number and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: 
(1)  An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; 
(2)  An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month; and 
(3)  An estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. 
All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection shall be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted as set forth in section 86-157. The notification required in this subsection does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements set forth in sections 86-153, 86-155 and 86-156. 
(b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as set forth in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as set forth in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director, the EPA's regional waste management waste division director and the state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. The provision of this subsection does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued under this article or any applicable federal or state law. 
(Code 1979, § 2-7-70) 
Sec. 86-162. - Analytical requirements. 
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques set forth in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. 
(Code 1979, § 2-7-71) 
Sec. 86-163. - Sample collection. 
(a)  Except as set forth in subsection (b) of this section, a user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. If flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that such technique will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(b)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(c)  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities, if such pretreatment facilities exist, or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment facilities exist. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards as defined in 40 CFR 403.12(b)(5). 
(Code 1979, § 2-7-72) 
Sec. 86-164. - Submission of reports. 
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked, if sent first class mail. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(Code 1979, § 2-7-73) 
Sec. 86-165. - Recordkeeping. 
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying by the director, EPD or EPA, all records or information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article, and any additional records or information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling, and the name of the person taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; the results of such analyses; and any other information required by this article. Such records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. Such period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the county, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the director.

Sec. 86-168. - Notification of violation. 
When the director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may serve upon such user a written notice of violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of such notice of violation, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the director. Submission of such plan shall in no way relieve the user of liability for any violation occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency action or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(Code 1979, § 2-7-77) 
Sec. 86-169. - Show cause hearing. 
The director may order a user which has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least 15 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on an authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against or prerequisite for taking any other action against the user. 
(Code 1979, § 2-7-78) 
Sec. 86-170. - Consent orders. 
The director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified on the documents. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as administrative orders issued pursuant to this article, and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(Code 1979, § 2-7-79) 
Sec. 86-171. - Compliance orders. 
When the director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified period of time. If the user does not come into compliance within the specified time, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user. 
(Code 1979, § 2-7-80) 
Sec. 86-172. - Cease and desist orders. 
(a)  When the director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to the user directing the user to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
(b)  Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user. 
(Code 1979, § 2-7-81) 
Sec. 86-173. - Administrative fines. 
(a)  When the director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued under this article, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may fine such user in an amount as set forth in section 1-9. Such fine shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other longterm average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of the violation. 
(b)  Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue at a rate of one percent per month. The director may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines and penalties. 
(c)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the director to reconsider the fine, along with full payment of the fine amount, within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the director may convene a hearing on the matter. If the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any penalty and accruing interest, shall be returned to the user. 
(d)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user. 
(Code 1979, § 2-7-82)

Sec. 90-53. - List of lot and structure requirements. 
The following table sets forth requirements for lot size, lot design and certain building requirements in the various residential zoning districts as indicated: 

 
   * Public water and sewer service required. 
  ** Minimum lot area is for the project as a whole and not for the individual lots within the project. 
 *** The planning commission may reduce minimum lot frontage of radial lots by one-third. After review by and upon the recommendation by the county engineer, the planning commission may further reduce the minimum frontage on radial lots to a distance at which the required minimum lot width at the building line is achieved at the minimum front setback line for the district. In no case shall the minimum lot frontage be reduced to less than 40 feet. 
**** Where the development is required to provide a buffer as required by section 90-139(a)(7) this acreage can be subtracted from the ten percent calculation for the common space requirement of this table. Where the buffer is included within the private individual lot area and where required buffers exceed the minimum required setbacks, the recorded plat will show the required buffer area and an additional ten feet to the rear or side building setback line. This requirement applies to property rezoned after January 1, 2012 only. 
Note:  In all zoning districts, common areas and utility service areas may, subject to approval of the planning commission, have a lot area less than provided in this table.

Sec. 90-90. - M-1 light industrial district. 
The M-1 light industrial district is established to provide areas for industry in locations which are served by major transportation facilities and adequate utilities, but are not feasible nor highly desirable for conventional industrial development because of their proximity to residential, recreational, commercial or related developments. The M-1 district is to permit development, compatible with uses of residential property adjoining or surrounding the district, with suitable open spaces, landscaping and parking areas. The land uses permitted in the M-1 district shall be as set forth in section 90-97, and lot and structure requirements shall be as set forth in section 90-98. 
(Code 1979, § 2-16-44) 
Sec. 90-91. - M-2 general industrial district. 
The M-2 general industrial district is established to provide areas for manufacturing, assembling, fabricating, warehousing and related activities. Such uses generate some emissions and have some adverse effects on surrounding properties, and are not compatible with primary commercial, institutional and residential uses. The land uses permitted in the M-2 district shall be as set forth in section 90-97, and lot and structure requirements shall be as set forth in section 90-98. 
(Code 1979, § 2-16-45) 
Sec. 90-92. - P-1 professional district. 
The P-1 professional district is established to provide for the development of structures for professional services which do not generate large volumes of traffic, noise or other harmful effects on adjoining residential areas.

(Code 1979, § 2-16-47; Ord. No. 09-02, § 1, 6-2-2009) 
Sec. 90-94. - PUD planned unit development district. 
The PUD planned unit development district intended to encourage innovative land planning and site design concepts that conform to community quality-of-life benchmarks and that achieve a high level of aesthetics, high-quality development, environmental sensitivity, energy efficiency, and other community goals by: 
(1)  Reducing or eliminating the inflexibility that sometimes results from strict application of zoning and development standards that were designed primarily for individual lots; 
(2)  Allowing greater freedom in providing a mix of land uses in the same development, including commercial, professional and residential with a mix of housing types, lot sizes, and densities; 
(3)  Allowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access, light, open space, and the provision of active recreational activities, for example ball fields, golf courses, swimming pools or tennis courts. 
(4)  Linking areas within the development by providing pedestrian-ways, bike-ways, and transportation systems and connecting to public sidewalks and bike paths as feasible; 
(5)  Promoting quality urban and traditional neighborhood design and environmentally sensitive development by allowing development to take advantage of special site characteristics, locations, and land uses. 
The planned unit development district may be permitted only in areas where public water and sewer are available. Proposals must be compatible with the character of surrounding land uses. It is recognized that some concepts will be more appropriate than others and the approval of an application in one location does not necessarily indicate the development will be suitable in other locations. Lot and structure requirements shall be as set forth in section 90-98. Additional requirements for the planned unit development district are contained in section 90-182. 
(Code 1979, § 2-16-48; Ord. No. 11-06, § 1(Exh. A), 3-1-2011) 
Sec. 90-95. - PDD planned development district. 
(a)  Established. The PDD planned development district is established to provide an orderly transition for inadequately buffered single-family residential development fronting an arterial street to a low-intensity commercial and office development. Suitable areas for a PDD district are those with a significant number of residential dwellings with shallow front yards, fronting an arterial street having a significant amount of existing commercial property fronting on such street. Consideration shall be given to the compatibility of new development with existing single-family homes by way of parking requirements, hours of operation, signage, lighting, exterior treatments and roof pitch. The land uses permitted in the PDD district shall be as set forth in section 90-97, and lot and structure requirements shall be as set forth in section 90-98. Additional requirements for the PDD district are contained in section 90-182. 
(b)  Special requirements. PDD districts shall be subject to the following requirements in addition to others contained in this chapter: 
(1)  Parking areas shall be located to the rear of the principal building. 
(2)  No lighted sign shall be directly visible from any residential zoning district. 
(3)  Hours of operation shall be limited to 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday. 
(4)  External security lighting on the property shall not be illuminated later than 11:00 p.m. or motion-sensitive lighting shall be installed. 
(5)  All principal buildings shall conform to the requirements of section 90-131(a)(7). 
(Code 1979, § 2-16-49) 
Sec. 90-96. - Evans Town Center overlay district. 
(a)  The Evans Town Center overlay district (the ETCO or ETCOD) is established to provide for and encourage the creation of a town center with a unique identity, to promote linkages between public, medical, retail and service uses in order to increase pedestrian activity, to provide opportunities for diversifying land uses and to improve vehicular access to the district. Urban design features such as lighting, coordinated signage, street furniture and landscaping should be used to provide visual cues that tie the district together. The architectural compatibility and aesthetic harmony of structures located within the ETCOD are important in protecting and promoting its appearance and character. The intent of the design review process is to assure respect for the character, integrity and quality of the built environment of the ETCOD; it is not intended to stifle compatible innovative architecture or beneficial economic development. 
(b)  Property located in the ETCOD shall be subject to the requirements, restrictions and limitations for the zoning district in which each property is located (i.e. C-1, C-C, C-2, C-3, etc.) subject to modifications made thereto by the requirements, restrictions and limitations set forth in this section for the ETCOD. Such property shall also be subject to the requirements, restrictions and limitations as herein set out which apply to the ETCOD. The land uses permitted in ETCOD shall be as set forth in section 90-97, and lot and structure requirements shall be as set forth in section 90-98 of this chapter. 
(c)  Proposed development shall be located and configured in a visually harmonious manner with the terrain and vegetation of the land on which the improvements are being developed and structures shall not dominate, in an incompatible manner, an adjacent building or surrounding general development that is in compliance with this chapter. 
The developer/architect is encouraged to attend a pre-development conference to demonstrate the overall architectural concept of the project. They should be able to illustrate their design intentions with renderings, photographs or other visual means. The developer/architect is required to submit a preliminary design site plan, building plan, elevations and a rendering to identify the architectural style, colors and building materials to be used. These shall be submitted for architectural review to the development services division at the design stage of the project, before any construction drawings are commenced. The developer/architect is required to submit samples of all materials and colors used for county approval at the time the full architectural plans are submitted. 
The architectural design, color and material of a proposed structure shall conform to community standards of good taste and design as expressed by this chapter. Proposed structures of inferior architectural design and/or material composition and long monotonous facade design, including those characterized by unrelieved repetition of shape or form, or by unbroken extension of line shall not be permitted. All elevations of a structure shall be in harmony with one another in terms of scale, proportion, detail, material, color and design quality. The side and rear elevations of buildings shall be as visually attractive as the front elevation, especially where those side or rear elevations are often viewed by the public. Roof lines and architectural detailing shall present a consistency in quality design. Structures within a proposed development and all canopies shall utilize a uniform architectural theme. It is not inferred that the buildings must look alike to achieve harmony. Harmony of style can be created through proper consideration of scale, proportion, detail, material, color, site planning and landscaping design. The architectural design and material finish of buildings, signs, canopies and other necessary structures shall be compatible with one another and adjacent and surrounding structures that are substantially in compliance with this chapter. Properties located in the ETCOD shall be subject to the following requirements in addition to those contained in other parts of this chapter: 
(1)  Building exterior elevations shall consist of materials that are generally equal in quality, appearance and detail to all other exterior elevations of the same structure or those structures within the same planned development. 
External building walls shall be architecturally designed and faced with bricks, stucco, structural masonry, stone or stone veneer, fiber cement board cladding, split face block, wood siding or wood shingles. Architectural metal panels and architectural glazing systems may be used as an accent and up to a maximum 25 percent of any elevation. Reflective or shiny surfaces and mirrored glass are prohibited. 
In the T-R townhouse residential, A-R apartment residential, PUD planned unit development and PDD planned development district zoning districts, herein referred to as the multi-family residential zoning districts, vinyl siding may be used, up to 50 percent of the exterior wall surface of any building excluding the front elevation. 
The M-1 light industrial and M-2 general industrial zoning districts, herein referred to as the industrial zoning districts, are exempt from the design criteria, except for elevations facing the main access roads, (Evans to Locks Road, North Belair Road, Old Evans Road.) All openings in the external walls shall be square or rectangular provided that arched or circle toped openings will be permitted. Except in the industrial zoning districts, a pedestrian arcade with a minimum depth of six feet is encouraged for all openings off of public streets or public open spaces. In commercial zoning districts C-1 neighborhood commercial, C-C community commercial, C-2 general commercial and C-3 heavy commercial zoning districts, herein referred to as the commercial zoning districts, in the P-1 professional zoning district, and in PUD planned unit development and PDD planned development district zoning districts, side and rear set back lines along the common boundary lines with property in said commercial zoning district or professional zoning district may be reduced, but not to a distance of less than three feet in the discretion of the Director of the Development Services Division of Columbia County. External building walls fronting on North Belair Road or public open space which fronts on North Belair Road shall be constructed on the set back lines which are established by this chapter which for purposes of this section shall also be build-to-lines provided that the Columbia County Planning Commission may in its discretion increase or decrease the distance between the build-to-line/set back line and the road right-of-way line or public open space boundary line. The Columbia County Planning Commission may, under subsection (c)(16) of this section, grant a variance from the preceding sentence if it finds from the evidence presented to it that features such as the topography of the land or other physical characteristics of the lot will increase the cost of construction of the project by more than ten percent and that such variance will not materially damage the appearance and character of the immediate area as it has been developed to the time such a variance is granted. 
(2)  Roofs if sloped shall be covered with shingles, tiles, standing seam metal, or other roofing material with similar appropriate texture and appearance. Flat roofs are not discouraged where they are appropriate to the design of the structure and shall be built-up on membrane. No flat roofs shall be permitted in the T-R townhouse residential and A-R apartment residential zoning districts. Sloped roofs shall be symmetrical hipped and gabled. Shed roofs may be placed against an external wall of a principal building only and must be sloped. 
(3)  Gutters for stormwater drainage which are metal and exposed and which include the gutters, downspouts and leaderheads are permitted. All exposed gutters, downspouts and leaderheads facing public streets and public open space shall be designed as an architectural element in the wall and roof design. Downspouts may connect directly to a storm drainage system or discharge on grade. 
(4)  Windows shall be clear glass with not more than a 30 percent reduction in light transmission permitted. The window frames must be metal, wood or vinyl and must be painted or vinyl clad. Except in commercial buildings with an enclosed heated area of 70,000 square feet or more, individual window openings shall be no larger than four feet horizontally and eight feet vertically. Circular, semi-circular and octagonal windows are permitted. Whether the windows shall be fixed glass or operational windows shall be coordinated with the uses of the interior and exterior spaces in the vicinity of each window. In commercial buildings with an enclosed heated area of 70,000 square feet or more, and all industrial buildings, the size of the window openings shall be appropriate for and consistent with the scale of the building. 
(5)  Doors may be solid or hollow core metal, aluminum, fiberglass or wood and may be either solid or have glass or louvers. Glass in any door shall be clear or leaded glass with not more than a 30 percent reduction in the light transmission permitted. Door frames may be metal or wood and must be painted or stained. Door openings shall be no larger than six feet horizontally and ten feet vertically. Solid doors shall have raised panels and/or louvers. Door operation shall be coordinated with the uses of the interior and exterior spaces in the vicinity of each door. Overhead doors for loading docks, delivery and distribution shall be permitted only on the rear of the building, except that in commercial buildings with an enclosed heated area of 70,000 square feet or more, and all industrial buildings, such overhead doors shall also be permitted on the side of the building. The size of door openings shall be appropriate for and consistent with the scale of the building. 
(6)  Balconies and porches shall be encouraged if they are constructed to blend with the architecture of the building. Balconies and porches at floor elevations above ground level shall be designed to create a pedestrian arcade at the ground level along public streets and public open space. 
(7)  Fences and landscaping walls may be used. Fences shall be constructed of materials coordinating with external building walls, wrought iron, vinyl or painted aluminum. Wood fences may be allowed upon the approval of the planning services director, provided that the proposed fence design is compatible with adjacent or nearby properties, provides a finished appearance on both sides of the fence, and meets the intent of this section. Where visible from a roadway or adjacent property, fence lines must be landscaped with a mix of evergreen trees and shrubs. Landscaping walls shall be constructed of materials matching external building walls, wrought iron, painted aluminum, or concrete landscape block that compliments the material used for exterior building walls. Landscaping wall surfaces shall have a minimum overall opacity of 85 percent. In the M-1 and M-2 zoning districts green or black coated or painted chain link fencing may be used provided that a solid hedge which is allowed to grow to and is maintained at the same height of such fence is planted in front of the fence along the section of fence that is visible from the road. 
(8)  Outbuildings and accessory structures may be constructed only of materials which match the external building walls of the principal structure. The layout and massing of outbuildings and accessory structures shall be designed to coordinate with the primary structure. 
(9)  Color combination or stains shall be complimentary, with generally no more than three colors per building being permitted. The exterior of any structure in the ETCOD including buildings and the doors, windows and trim thereof, fences, landscaping walls and any other type of structure may be any color provided that all color combinations are complimentary and do not exceed three colors unless expressly approved in writing by the Columbia County Planning Commission; provided, however, that no colors shall be used which are listed in a master list of excluded colors which shall be prepared by the Columbia County Planning and Development Services Division and approval by the board of commissioners. The master list of excluded colors may have colors added to it or deleted from it from time to time as the Columbia County Planning and Development Services Division with the approval of the board of commissioners shall determine. 
(10)  Heating and/or air-conditioning mechanical equipment, whether ground level, raised or roof-top must be screened from view. In addition, garbage receptacles, fuel tanks, electric and gas meters and other unsightly objects must be screened from view. Screened from view shall mean concealed from view from any abutting road or adjacent tract of land by a structure constructed of the same materials as the exterior elevation of the principle structure, and if on or attached to the principal structure front designed to be perceived as an integral part of the building. 
(11)  Structures shall be oriented, or screened in accordance with sections 90-139 and 90-140 of the Code of Ordinances of Columbia County so that loading, delivery and distribution areas are in no manner visible from residential zoning districts or existing or planned public road rights-of-way. Loading areas may be oriented toward adjoining properties that are similarly zoned, if and only if they are screened from view with fencing and landscaping in accordance with sections 90-139 and 90-140 of the Code of Ordinances of Columbia County. In areas where significant elevation differences exist such that residential zoning districts or existing or planned public road rights-of-way look down on the structures in question and screening fences or other screening devices of eight feet in height would not hide such loading, delivery and distribution areas, this shall constitute a basis on which the Columbia County Planning Commission may grant a variance under subsection (16) hereof to the requirements of the preceding two sentences. Loading docks and doors shall be situated so as to accommodate all trucks and trailers without requiring them to maneuver in (other than turning into the access drive) or protrude into a street during loading or unloading. Exceptions can be made in cases of extreme elevation differences at staff's discretion during plan review. 
(12)  Structures of symbolic design for reasons of advertising shall only be permitted when they meet the provisions of this chapter. 
(13)  Reserved. 
(14)  Reserved. 
(15)  Any buildings, structures, signs or uses in the ETCOD which are existing on November 18, 2002 which are not in conformance with the requirements for the ETCOD shall be treated as nonconforming buildings, structures, signs or uses pursuant to section 90-132 of this chapter. 
(16)  In order not to stifle compatible innovative architecture or beneficial economic development, the Columbia County Planning Commission may review site plans, building plans and landscape/tree protection plans for any project in the ETCOD which do not meet the standards and requirements of this section, and may approve variations from those standards and requirements if the planning commission finds that the variations permitted will not materially alter the unique identity and character of the ETCOD, materially interfere with the architectural compatibility and aesthetic harmony of structures located within the ETCOD or otherwise materially adversely affect the appearance or environment of the ETCOD. Prior to approving such a variation the Columbia County Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing advertised in the same manner as a public hearing for a variance application under section 90-179(c) of this chapter. Any person who appears at such public hearing and supports a position contrary to the actions taken by the planning commission may appeal the action of the planning commission to the board of commissioners of Columbia County by filing a written notice of such appeal with the clerk of the board of commissioners and the Director of the Columbia County Planning and Development Services Division. The notice of appeal must be so filed within seven days of the date of the meeting at which the planning commission voted to take the action being appealed from. The board of commissioners shall hear such appeal at a regular or special meeting within 30 days of the date the notice of appeal is filed. The action of the board of commissioners shall be final. 
(d)  The initial boundaries of the ETCOD and the land included therein shall be as shown on an Evans Town Center Overlay District Official Zoning Map prepared by the Planning and Development Services Division of Columbia County dated October 17, 2002, which is incorporated herein by reference. The then current Evans Town Center Overlay District Official Zoning Map as updated from time to time to show changes in the boundaries of the ETCOD shall be maintained as an official zoning map in accordance with the provisions of section 90-5 of this chapter. Single-family residential properties in the R-A residential-agricultural, R-1 single-family residential, R-1A single-family residential, R-2 single-family residential, R-3 single-family residential, R-3A single and two family residential and R-4 recreational residential zoning districts (the single-family residential zoning districts) are not included in the ETCOD. Any land which is in one of the single-family residential zoning districts and located in the circle with a 1¼ mile radius measured from the center of the intersection of Washington Road with North Belair Road on its southwest side and Industrial Park Drive on its northeast side as shown on the Evans Town Center Overlay District Official Zoning Map if it is rezoned so that it is no longer in one of the single-family residential zoning districts shall automatically be included in the ETCOD.

Sec. 90-99. - Corridor protection overlay district. 
(a)  A corridor protection overlay district (CPOD) can be established to provide for and encourage the creation of a corridor with a unique identity, and to protect public health, safety and welfare through the preservation of the county's transportation corridors. The adoption of standards in a CPOD for screening, landscaping and aesthetics is necessary to ensure that future development will not degrade the character of these transportation corridors and will maintain or enhance the aesthetics and function of these transportation corridors and their ability to serve as cultural assets for the residents and visitors of Columbia County. Urban design features such as lighting, coordinated signage, street furniture and landscaping should be used to provide visual cues that tie the transportation corridor together. The screening and landscaping requirements within a CPOD are important in protecting motorists by limiting distracting visual clutter and promoting corridor appearance and character. The intent of the design review process is to assure respect for the character, integrity and quality of the built environment of a CPOD; it is not intended to stifle compatible innovative architecture or beneficial economic development. 
(b)  Property located in a CPOD shall be subject to the requirements, restrictions and limitations for the zoning district in which each property is located subject to modifications made thereto by the requirements, restrictions and limitations set forth for a CPOD. Such property shall also be subject to the requirements, restrictions and limitations as herein set out which apply to a CPOD. 
(c)  Property located in a CPOD shall be subject to the following requirements: 
(1)  The building exterior elevation requirements stipulated in subsection 90-96(c)(1) of the Code, but excluding the provisions of that section pertaining to openings, arcades and setbacks. 
(2)  The provisions of subsection 90-96(c)(2) of the Code pertaining to roofs, (3) pertaining to gutters, (5) pertaining to doors, except that all commercial buildings may be allowed overhead doors on the sides regardless of building size and single-family residences are exempt from this requirement, (7) pertaining to fences and landscaping walls, (8) pertaining to outbuildings and accessory structures, (10) pertaining to screening of mechanical equipment, garbage equipment and similar objects, except single-family residences are exempt from this requirement, and (11) pertaining to screening of loading and delivery areas. 
(3)  Outdoor display of merchandise is limited to 20 percent of the entire area of a property. The percentage of area dedicated to outdoor display of merchandise may be increased up to the entire area of a property if no more than ten percent of the entire property is dedicated to outdoor display which is visible from the main thoroughfare running through the CPOD with the remainder of the outdoor display being screened from view from the main thoroughfare in the CPOD by a building, privacy fence and/or wall meeting all CPOD standards. Products for outdoor display visible from the main thoroughfare in a CPOD may not be metal sheds, metal buildings or similar metal structures. These outdoor display provisions shall not apply to automobile and truck sales and rentals. 
(d)  In order not to stifle compatible innovative architecture or beneficial economic development, the Columbia County Planning Commission may review site plans, building plans and landscape/tree protection plans for any project in a CPOD which do not meet the standards and requirements of this section, and may approve variations from those standards and requirements if the planning commission finds that the variations permitted will not materially alter the unique identity and character of the CPOD, materially interfere with the architectural compatibility and aesthetic harmony of structures located within the CPOD or otherwise materially adversely affect the appearance or environment of the CPOD. Prior to approving such a variation, the Columbia County Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing advertised in the same manner as a public hearing for a variance application under subsection 90-179(c) of this chapter. Any person who appears at such public hearing and supports a position contrary to the actions taken by the planning commission may appeal the action of the planning commission to the board of commissioners of Columbia County by filing a written notice of such appeal with the clerk of the board of commissioners and the director of Columbia County Planning Services. The notice of appeal must be so filed within seven days of the date of the meeting at which the planning commission voted to take the action being appealed from. The board of commissioners shall hear such appeal at a regular or special meeting within 30 days of the date the notice of appeal is filed. The action of the board of commissioners shall be final. 
(e)  The board of commissioners may create one or more CPODs within the unincorporated area of Columbia County by adopting an amendment or amendments to this section describing the boundaries of the CPOD being created, giving the CPOD a name and directing that it be shown by such name on the then-current official zoning map of Columbia County. 
(f)  (1)  There is established the Fury's Ferry Road corridor Protection Overlay District (Fury's Ferry Road CPOD) which shall be subject to all of the provisions of this section. The boundaries of the Fury's Ferry Road CPOD and the land included therein shall be as shown on the then current official zoning map of Columbia County, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Fury's Ferry Road CPOD shall consist of all tracts of land which front on that portion of Fury's Ferry Road beginning on its western end at the Columbia County/Richmond County boundary line and extending to the Georgia/South Carolina State boundary line on its eastern end which are not located in the R-A residential agricultural, R-1 single-family residential, R-1A single-family residential, R-2 single-family residential, R-3 single-family residential R-3A single-family residential and two-family residential and R-4 recreational residential zoning districts (the "single-family residential zoning districts"). Any land that is in one of these single-family residential zoning districts and has road frontage on the designated portion of Fury' Ferry Road shall automatically be included in CPOD when its zoning classification is changed to a district that is not one of the single-family residential zoning districts. If a tract of land which is in the Fury's Ferry Road CPOD is combined with a tract of land which is not in the Fury's Ferry Road CPOD, the entire combined tract shall automatically be included in the Fury's Ferry Road CPOD except for any portion of such combined tract which is located in any of the single-family residential zoning districts. Any building, structures, signs or uses in the Fury's Ferry Road CPOD which existed on November 15, 2005 which are not in conformance with the requirements for the Fury's Ferry Road CPOD shall be treated as nonconforming buildings, structures, signs or uses pursuant to section 90-132. 
(2)  There is established the North Washington Road Corridor Protection Overlay District ("North Washington Road CPOD") which shall be subject to all of the provisions of this section. The boundaries of the North Washington Road CPOD and the land included therein shall be as shown on the then current official zoning map of Columbia County, which is incorporated herein by reference.

(Ord. No. 05-06, § 1, 6-7-2005; Ord. No. 05-10, §§ 1, 2 10-18-2005; Ord. No. 05-11, § 1, 11-1-2005; Ord. No. 05-12, § 1, 11-15-2005; Ord. No. 06-03, § 1, 3-21-2006; Ord. No. 17-08 , § 19(Exh. S), 2-6-2018) 
Sec. 90-100. - Node protection overlay district. 
(a)  A node protection overlay district (NPOD) can be established to provide for and encourage the creation of a nodal area with a unique identity, to establish design guidelines for all development within the nodal area, to ensure compatibility of commercial development within the node as well as with nearby residential development, to reflect regional styles, to create human scaled architecture and outdoor spaces, to promote pedestrian and bicycle access to the nodal area as well as improving vehicular access and to protect public health, safety and welfare through the preservation and aesthetic enhancement of the county's nodal areas. The adoption of standards in an NPOD for design, construction, screening, landscaping and aesthetics is necessary to ensure that future development will not degrade the character of these nodal areas and will maintain or enhance the aesthetics and function of these nodal areas and their ability to serve as cultural assets for the residents and visitors of Columbia County. Urban design features such as lighting, coordinated signage, street furniture and landscaping should be used to provide visual cues that tie a nodal area together. The intent of the design review process is to assure respect for the character, integrity and quality of the built environment of a NPOD; it is not intended to stifle compatible innovative architecture within the designated style of design or beneficial economic development. A "node" is defined as the area designated by the board of commissioners which surrounds the intersection of two roads usually classified as primary arteries where concentrations of certain types of commercial, professional and in some cases residential development activity are desirable. This is designed to be a concentrated activity center for the location of more intense land uses thereby protecting abutting neighborhoods from such uses, lessening sprawl and making the most efficient use of infrastructure which serves the area. 
(b)  Property located in an NPOD shall be subject to the requirements, restrictions and limitations for the zoning district in which each property is located subject to modifications made thereto by the requirements, restrictions and limitations set forth for the NPOD. 
(c)  Property located in a NPOD also shall be subject to such requirements, restrictions and limitations as the ordinance creating that NPOD shall specify. In the event that any property located within an NPOD is also located within a Corridor Protection Overlay District ("CPOD") pursuant to section 90-99 of this Code, the provisions applicable to the NPOD shall apply to the property and the provision of the CPOD shall not apply to the property. 
(d)  In order not to stifle compatible innovative architecture or beneficial economic development, the Columbia County Planning Commission may review site plans, building plans and landscape/tree protection plans for any project in a NPOD which do not meet the applicable standards and requirements, and may approve variations from those standards and requirements if the planning commission finds that the variations permitted will not materially alter the unique identity and character of the NPOD, materially interfere with the architectural compatibility and aesthetic harmony of structures located within the NPOD or otherwise materially adversely affect the appearance or environment of the NPOD. Prior to approving such a variation, the Columbia County Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing advertised in the same manner as a public hearing for a variance application under subsection 90-179(c) of this chapter. Any person who appears at such public hearing and supports a position contrary to the actions taken by the planning commission may appeal the action of the planning commission to the board of commissioners of Columbia County by filing a written notice of such appeal with the clerk of the board of commissioners and the director of the Columbia County Planning and Development Services Division. The notice of appeal must be so filed within seven days of the date of the meeting at which the planning commission voted to take the action being appealed from. The board of commissioners shall hear such appeal at a regular or special meeting within 30 days of the date the notice of appeal is filed. The action of the board of commissioners shall be final. 
(e)  The board of commissioners may create one or more NPODs within the unincorporated area of Columbia County by adopting an amendment or amendments to this section describing the boundaries of the NPOD being created, giving the NPOD a name, setting out any requirements, restrictions and limitations which shall apply to that NPOD and directing that the NPOD be shown by its designated name on the then-current official zoning map of Columbia County. 
(f)  (1)  There is established the Evans to Locks/Furys Ferry Node Protection Overlay District ("EL/FF NPOD") which shall be subject to all of the provisions of this section 90-100. The boundaries of the EL/FF NPOD and the land included therein shall be as shown on a map of the Evans to Locks/Furys Ferry Node Protection Overlay District prepared by the Columbia County Planning and Development Services Division dated October 19, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference and which shall be incorporated into the then current official zoning map of Columbia County, which is also incorporated herein by reference. If a tract of land which is in the EL/FF NPOD is combined with a tract of land which is not in the EL/FF NPOD, the entire combined tract shall automatically be included in the EL/FF NPOD except for any portion of such combined tract which is located in any of the single-family residential zoning districts. Any buildings, structures, signs or uses in the EL/FF NPOD which existed on January 16, 2007 which are not in conformance with the requirements for the EL/FF NPOD shall be treated as nonconforming buildings, structures, signs or uses pursuant to section 90-132 of this chapter. The properties within the EL/FF NPOD shall be subject to the following requirements, restrictions and limitations: 
A)  Architectural style. The architectural style for the EL/FF NPOD is neo-traditional. Neo-traditional architecture reflects a style which is adaptable to many different building types, and is compatible with many of the residential designs nearby. Neo-traditional architecture reflects historically inspired architectural features. Some key characteristics of neo-traditional architecture are symmetry and ample, proportionate detailing. Some features of neo-traditional architecture are: 
I.  Symmetrically placed windows. 
II.  Small windows ("lights") as details over doors and at other places on the facade. 
III.  Columns or pilasters. 
IV.  Human-scaled windows and doors. 
V.  Gabled or pedimented roofs. 
The developer/architect is encouraged to attend a pre-application conference to demonstrate the overall architectural concept of the project. They should be able to illustrate their design intentions with renderings, photographs or other visual means. These shall be submitted for architectural review to the Columbia County Planning and Development Division. 
The developer/architect is encouraged to attend a pre-development conference to submit a preliminary design site plan, elevations listing the building materials to be used and renderings or photographs to illustrate the architectural style and proposed colors. These shall be submitted for architectural review to the Columbia County Planning and Development Division at the design stage of the project, before any construction drawings are commenced. If construction drawings are already started, then the developer and architect must be willing to make the necessary changes requested, following the architectural review. 
B)  Materials. Materials must be traditional construction materials such as brick, stone or stone veneer, stucco, fiber cement board cladding or natural wood. Materials that are not permitted include vinyl and metal cladding. Metal may be used for roofing materials, balconies and railings. 
C)  Colors. Colors must reflect traditional materials and colors. Predominantly neutral and earth tones are recommended, with trim colors usually in a white or black. Generally three colors are adequate for each facade. 
D)  Unique element. Each development must have a unique architectural element that serves as the defining feature for the entire development, such as a clock tower. 
E)  Massing, scale, and height. To create a human scale, large buildings must be broken into smaller masses. Each larger building must look like a collection of adjacent smaller buildings of different types. 
I.  For smaller store sizes: 
a.  The facade must have a change in setback every 40 feet minimum. This means that some storefronts will project further than others. 
b.  The storefront must also have a change in material, color, fenestration, or height along with each change in setback. 
II.  For larger store sizes: 
a.  The preferred arrangement is to have several smaller scale stores in front, hiding the large-scale facade. 
b.  As an alternative, larger stores must have a tall architectural element with a horizontal forward setback either in the center, at a major entrance or at the corner of the building. 
c.  Large-scale stores over 150 feet in length must have additional variations in massing as well. 
III.  The recommended height for most structures is two stories. The two story height creates a better sense of enclosure than one story without creating an overwhelming sense of scale. 
a.  Variations between two and three stories are encouraged. 
b.  One story buildings are permitted, but must have dormers or a similar architectural feature to create the illusion of a taller building. 
F)  Recommended uses for upper floors: 
I.  Residential uses are permitted on the upper floors. These may be in live-work arrangements in combination with the first floor or as separate spaces. 
II.  Office uses are permitted on upper floors. 
III.  Generally a mixed-use arrangement works well when the grade on the back side is higher than the grade on the front, allowing for separate ground level entrances for the various uses. 
G)  Windows and doors. Facades must have regular windows and doors to increase the architectural detail and create a human scale environment. Windows and doors create visual detail and are channels for interaction between indoor and outdoor space. Windows and doors must be framed by detailing elements such as lintels, shutters, and pediments. 
I.  Window regulations: 
a.  At least 50 percent of the storefront between three and eight feet above ground level must be transparent glass. 
b.  Upper floor windows and dormers must be evenly spaced and vertically oriented (taller than they are wide). 
c.  Upper floor windows must be double-hung and have multiple, small panes. 
d.  Shutters or balcony rails outside windows are encouraged. 
e.  Lintels and/or brick details above and below windows are required. 
II.  Door regulations: 
a.  Doors must be recessed a minimum of eight inches to create an appearance of thick walls. 
b.  Doorways must be made of wood, steel, fiberglass, composites or glass materials or other materials approved by the Director of Columbia County Planning and Development or his designee. The architectural style of the door should be complimentary to the style of the building. 
c.  Doorways must be traditional sizes. 
d.  Lights above doors and thick door surrounds are strongly encouraged. 
H)  Related regulations: 
I.  Top of the facade must be marked by a detailed cornice. 
II.  Dentils or other similar types of ornamentation are encouraged. 
III.  Small arcades and awnings are encouraged. 
IV.  If awnings are used, they must be rectangular, canvas awnings and must be maintained in good condition. 
I)  Roofs. Roofs are defining architectural features. Sloped roofs for commercial buildings will help to reinforce the neo-traditional architectural theme and will help commercial development mesh with nearby residential areas. 
(i)  Roof regulations: 
a.  All roofs must be sloped unless otherwise provided herein. 
b.  Roofs may be hipped or gabled, and a front facing pediment is encouraged. 
c.  For smaller storefront types, the minimum pitch is 4:12. 
d.  For larger storefronts, each massing element must have a distinct sloped roof which may be incorporated with flat roof components meeting the requirements set forth in (ii) immediately below. 
e.  Roofs may be made of various materials, including traditional asphalt as well as standing seam metal. 
(ii)  Sloped roofs are required for large buildings and storefronts as well: 
a.  Instead of a single, large sloped roof, the building shall have a series of smaller roofs, with the roofs corresponding to the building massing. 
b.  The sloped roof must be the only part of the roof visible from the front and the sides of the building. Flat roof components may be used where they are not visible from the front and sides of the building. No equipment installed on the roof may be visible from the front or the sides of the building. 
c.  The sloped roof must rise to a height of at least eight feet from its lowest to its highest point for the tallest roof segment. 
d.  Designs which may be used as an alternative to the sloped roof: 
1.  Incorporate into the roof design a tall architectural element such as a cupola or dome in the center, at a major entrance or at the corner of the building, in which case those portions of the roof hidden from view by a decorative cornice may be a flat roof construction; 
2.  Incorporate into the facade design a pediment feature that is at least one-third the width of the entire facade, is symmetrically placed within the facade design, usually in the center, and is integrally tied into a sloped roof structure covering the portion of the building behind the pediment. 
J)  Site design. Site design can help create a human-scaled, pedestrian-oriented experience. The site design must emphasize the interaction of indoor and outdoor space. Outdoor spaces should encourage leisurely shopping, browsing, and gathering. It is the character of outdoor gathering spaces that creates the sense of neighborhood-friendly shopping areas. 
One of two site designs is required: 
I.  Small setback site design. Small setback site design balances having a street-friendly presence with enough of a setback to buffer the noise from nearby street traffic. This site design places the building fairly close to the public sidewalk. As a result, pedestrian and bicycle access is easier and shoppers are encouraged to park once and walk between shopping destinations. 
a.  No more than one bay of parking (about 60 feet of pavement) can be placed between the retail promenade and the streetscape. 
b.  Additional parking areas can be provided in the rear and on the edges of the site. 
c.  Sidewalks of minimum five-foot width must be provided connecting any parking areas with the retail promenade area in front. 
II.  Internal main street site design. Internal main street designs are also permitted. These designs incorporate a "main street" internal to the site, with building facades and retail promenades lining both sides of the main street. The goal of the main street design is to create a quiet, pedestrian friendly outdoor area internal to the site. 
a.  No more than three bays of parking are permitted between the building facades. 
b.  Usually the main street avenues have one-way lanes with diagonal parking, to slow down traffic and encourage convenient parking. 
c.  Overflow parking is permitted on the periphery of the site, including between the public roads and the site. 
III.  The backs of the buildings that face the public right-of-way must be carefully addressed: 
a.  Facade materials and some treatments must be continued to the side or rear of buildings that face the right-of-way. For example, window and roof patterns must continue in a similar pattern on the side or rear. 
b.  Dumpsters and utilities must not be visible from rights-of-way or from residential properties. 
c.  A six-foot masonry wall is recommended between the streetscape and the rear of buildings. 
d.  Loading at grade level in the rear is encouraged when possible. 
For both types of site design, all parking areas must have at least one shade tree per every ten parking spaces. 
K)  Retail promenade. The promenade consists of the pedestrian area immediately in front of the building facade. A well-designed promenade is essential to creating inviting, pedestrian friendly common spaces. The promenade is made inviting by its width, by the use of a variety of quality materials, and by providing amenities such as lighting, planters, and seating. The promenade serves the functions of both an outdoor place for activity and for pedestrian transportation. 
I.  The retail promenade must be a minimum of ten feet in width, with an average width of 14 feet. 
II.  Landscaping and/or street furniture is required on at least ten percent of the retail promenade. 
III.  All-brick promenades are encouraged, and the promenade must consist of at least 50 percent brick or stone. 
IV.  Paved surfaces shall be of materials that blend with nearby building materials and landscaping materials. Asphalt may not be used for any part of the promenade. 
V.  Continuous pedestrian access must be available from the street sidewalk and from parking lots to the retail promenade along a minimum five-foot width sidewalk. 
VI.  If the pedestrian path leading to the promenade runs along the edge of a parking area, a minimum three-foot grass or planted buffer must be provided in addition to the five-foot walkway. This ensures that cars do not infringe upon the walkway area. 
L)  Parks and plazas. In addition to the retail promenade, large sites (over ten acres) must also incorporate parks and/or plazas as gathering places. Inviting gathering places help build a sense of community for nearby residents and encourage shoppers to linger. Parks and plazas must be integrated into shopping areas so that they are visible from actively used areas such as promenades or storefronts, and not placed in a hidden part of the site. In fact, a well-placed plaza may be an extension or expansion of the promenade area. A plaza can serve as an outdoor waiting area for a busy restaurant. Plazas and parks do not need "play" equipment - all that is needed is seating areas, trees and plants, shade, and perhaps a fountain or monument as a central element. 
I.  The minimum size for a park or plaza is five percent of the disturbed area for sites over ten acres in size. 
II.  As an alternative to a park or plaza, the developer may choose to leave at least five percent of the site land undisturbed. The undisturbed area must be forested and is subject to the approval of the planning department. 
M)  Streetscapes. Streetscapes serve to improve the public appearance of a EL/FF NPOD and to enable pedestrian and bicycle access. A consistent streetscape across different properties ties together a unified design theme for the EL/FF NPOD. 
I.  The streetscape consists of three parts: 
a.  A landscape buffer to set the pedestrian area back from the road (street buffer). 
b.  The sidewalk. 
c.  A second landscape buffer to shield the view of parking areas (parking buffer). 
II.  Streetscape regulations: 
a.  The street buffer must be a minimum of five feet in width. 
b.  The street buffer must have street trees planted every 40 feet on center, minimum. 
c.  Lights must be placed at least every 40 feet in the street buffer. 
d.  Two out of every three lights in the street buffer must be a pedestrian-style light, which are shorter, and of a design that matches the street lights. 
e.  The parking buffer must be a minimum of five feet in width. 
f.  The parking buffer must be planted with continuous shrubs or hedges a maximum of 30 inches in height. 
g.  The parking buffer must have street trees planted every 40 feet on center minimum. 
h.  The sidewalk area must be a minimum of eight feet in width and must be clear of any obstacles. 
i.  All trees planted for streetscape requirements must be four-inch caliper minimum at time of planting. 
j.  All street trees along Furys Ferry Road must be Nuttall Oaks or another tree of equal size and quality approved by the Director of Columbia County Planning and Development or his designee. 
k.  All street trees along Evans to Locks Road must be Allee Elms or another tree of equal size and quality approved by Director of Columbia County Planning and Development or his designee. 
l.  Street and pedestrian lights must be historic and decorative in character. 
III.  Alternative to streetscape development: 
a.  As an alternative to a streetscape, the developer may leave an area equal to the size of the required streetscape undisturbed. The undisturbed area must be located along the street edge of the development, must be forested, and is subject to the approval of the Columbia County Department of Planning and Development department. 
N)  Street furniture. The use of high-quality street furniture throughout the EL/FF NPOD will create a sense of long-term investment and enhance property values. Consistent street furniture will help to unify the design character of the EL/FF NPOD. Developers must select street furniture that is similar in design, materials, and color. 
Specified street furniture includes: 
I.  Street lights. 
II.  Pedestrian lights. 
III.  Planters. 
IV.  Fencing. 
V.  Bollards. 
VI.  Benches. 
VII.  Garbage cans. 
O)  Lighting. Lighting must be designed to minimize light intrusion onto neighboring properties and to preserve dark night skies. Lighting regulations: 
I.  Full cut-off light fixtures are required for all street and pedestrian lights. 
II.  Parking lot light fixtures must be no more than 26 feet in height. 
III.  Pedestrian light fixtures must be no more than 14 feet in height. 
IV.  Taller lighting is permitted along public roadways where required by the department of transportation. 
V.  White spectrum lighting that preserves true color perception is required. 
VI.  Accent lighting to highlight architectural and landscape elements is encouraged. 
P)  Sign guidelines. Signs, while important, should be subordinate to architectural and landscape features. Signs must integrate with architectural features by matching in scale and materials with surrounding buildings. 
I.  All signs must be made of quality, durable materials. 
II.  Signs must coordinate with architecture in terms of materials and scale. 
III.  Development signs mark the entrances to commercial complexes. 
a.  Monument style signs are required with a maximum height of 20 feet. 
b.  The total size of the sign face or message area shall be no more than 200 square feet, and the entire sign structure shall be no more than 300 square feet. 
c.  Listing of individual tenants is discouraged. If a list is provided, consistent foreground and background color must be used throughout the sign and must coordinate with the colors used in the commercial development. 
IV.  Wall-mounted signs are signs posted on buildings to advertise specific stores. 
a.  The maximum letter height may be no more than 15 percent of the facade height or 36 inches, whichever is smaller. 
b.  Wall-mounted signs must align with other facade elements, such as doorways and windows. 
V.  Other sign regulations: 
a.  Each business may have no more than three signs total. 
b.  Signs that are not permitted include billboards, pole signs, banners, neon signs, balloon signs, flashing signs, moveable-type signs, and search lights. 
c.  Perpendicular signs are encouraged. Generally perpendicular signs are made of wood, and may project no more than four feet from the building facade. 
d.  Glass-etched signs are also encouraged. Signs on awnings are also permitted, but the size of the lettering must not be any larger than the size permitted on the building facade. 
e.  Temporary signs are prohibited. 
Small-scale signs can actually enhance the quality of the pedestrian environment. The key to quality signs is proper scale, quality materials, and quality craftsmanship. Colors must generally be muted and natural. 
Q)  Buffers and fences. Landscaped buffers are required between any single-family use and any non-single-family use as well as between multifamily and commercial or industrial uses. 
I.  A 30-foot landscaped buffer is required between any single-family use and any non-single family use. 
II.  A 20-foot buffer is required between multifamily residential uses and commercial uses. 
III.  The landscaped buffer shall consist of a continuous wall of mature evergreen shrubs. 
IV.  Parking, storage, or other similar uses are prohibited in the buffer area. 
V.  An opaque fence six feet in height must also be used for screening at the edge of the buffer. See subsection (f)(1)(R)(II) for materials which must be used in constructing such fence. 
VI.  Barriers and buffers between commercial properties are not encouraged except where necessary for security. Provisions must be made to promote pedestrian and vehicular access between adjacent commercial developments. 
R)  Fencing regulations: 
I.  Fencing must be opaque if used for security and privacy purposes. Decorative walls/fences must compliment the architecture of the development. 
II.  Fence/wall materials can be pressure treated natural wood, brick, stucco and stone. Fence and wall finishes should compliment the materials used on the buildings in the development. 
III.  Screen walls must be high enough to screen dumpsters and utilities up to a maximum of eight feet in height. 
IV.  Fencing around detention ponds may be wrought iron, painted aluminum or black vinyl coated chain link with heavy landscaping. The Director of Columbia County Planning and Development or his designee must approve the material used based on site specific design criteria. 
S)  Other requirements. Commercial developments in the Evans to Locks/Fury's Ferry EL/FF NPOD must not present visual blight to any public right-of-way or any residential property. Preventing visual blight can best be done primarily by proper site design and secondarily by screening. 
The following regulations apply: 
I.  Utility wires must be buried for any new commercial development. 
II.  Outdoor storage of merchandise or materials is not permitted. 
III.  Utilities and dumpsters must be out of view. 
IV.  Loading and service areas must be out of view from public rights-of-way.

(2)  There is established the Belair/Columbia Node Protection Overlay District ("Belair/Columbia NPOD") which shall be subject to all of the provisions of this section 90-100. The boundaries of the Belair/Columbia NPOD and the land included therein shall be as shown on a map of the Belair/Columbia Node Protection Overlay District prepared by the Planning and Columbia County Development Services Division dated October 19, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference and which shall be incorporated into the then current Official Zoning Map of Columbia County, which is also incorporated herein by reference. If a tract of land which is in the Belair/Columbia NPOD is combined with a tract of land which is not in the Belair/Columbia NPOD, the entire combined tract shall automatically be included in the Belair/Columbia NPOD except for any portion of such combined tract which is located in any of the single-family residential zoning districts. Any buildings, structures, signs or uses in the Belair/Columbia NPOD which existed on August 7, 2007, which are not in conformance with the requirements for the Belair/Columbia NPOD shall be treated as nonconforming buildings, structures, signs or uses pursuant to section 90-132 of this chapter. The properties within the Belair/Columbia NPOD shall be subject to the following requirements, restrictions and limitations: 
A)  Architectural style. The architectural style for the Belair/Columbia NPOD is traditional southern vernacular. This style reflects native styles and local architectural models which are found in historic town centers such as downtown Augusta or Athens. Buildings would be no more than 50 feet wide without variations in massing, height, material, and facade ornamentation which is used to break up large buildings so they appear as a series of smaller buildings. Features of southern vernacular commercial architecture include: 
I.  Parapet walls. 
II.  Cornice lines at top of facade. 
III.  Decorative patterns in brick arrangements or by using varied materials. 
IV.  Columns or pilasters. 
V.  Store front windows. 
VI.  Awnings. 
VII.  Arcades. 
The developer/architect is encouraged to attend a pre-application conference to demonstrate the overall architectural concept of the project. They should be able to illustrate their design intentions with renderings, photographs or other visual means. These shall be submitted for architectural review to the Columbia County Planning and Development Division. 
The developer/architect is encouraged to attend a pre-development conference to submit a preliminary design site plan, elevations listing the building materials to be used and renderings or photographs to illustrate the architectural style and proposed colors. These shall be submitted for architectural review to the Columbia County Planning and Development Division at the design stage of the project, before any construction drawings are commenced. If construction drawings are already started, then the developer and architect must be willing to make the necessary changes requested, following the architectural review. 
B)  Materials. Materials must be traditional construction materials such as brick, stone or stone veneer, stucco, fiber cement board cladding or natural wood. Materials that are not permitted include vinyl and metal cladding. Metal may be used for roofing materials, balconies and railings. 
C)  Colors. Colors are required to reflect traditional materials. Predominantly neutral and earth tones reflecting traditional materials are recommended, with trim colors usually in a white or black. No more than three colors may be used for each facade. 
D)  Massing, scale, and height. Human-scale details are encouraged. Human-scale detail can be provided by the use of smaller scale windows and doors. Patterns of brick or patterns of materials create additional detailing. Variations in material or design at the top and bottom of columns also provide visual detail. Cornice lines and other horizontal lines provide a variation in material and color as well. To create a human-scale, large buildings must be broken into smaller masses. At the same time, buildings must have sufficient height to create an architectural presence. 
I.  Every building must have a change in height and setback every 50 feet minimum. Usually these changes should occur along with changes in the facade materials. 
II.  Storefronts wider than 70 feet must have a height element, a piece of the building that is higher than other surrounding pieces. Usually this height element should be in the center of the building, though it may also be placed at the comer. 
III.  The minimum height of the highest point on the facade must be 18 feet, while the minimum average height for the facade must be at least 15 feet. 
IV.  The use of parapet walls is encouraged to hide utilities located on the roof. 
V.  The maximum height for all buildings is 55 feet. 
E)  Facades, side, and rear. Human-scale detail and variation must be used to make facades interesting and inviting. Facades must be detailed and varied through the use of windows, doors, awnings, materials, height and pattern. The rear and sides of a building may be less detailed so long as they are not visible from the public right-of-way or other private properties. 
I.  The facade must vary a minimum of every 50 feet with a change of material, height, or decorative pattern. 
II.  A detailed cornice is required at the top of every facade. 
III.  The cornice line itself is a decorative horizontal element. 
IV.  The regular use of columns or pilasters is strongly encouraged. 
V.  Columns must have variation of material or thickness to indicate their base and capital and must occur at least every 15 feet. 
VI.  Columns must be used when the building provides an arcade. 
VII.  Other permitted materials may be used on the side and the rear so long as these areas are not visible from the public right-of-way or other private properties. 
VIII.  If the rear or side is visible from the public right-of-way or adjacent properties, the same material must be used on these sides and decorative patterns of materials, windows, awnings, and columns must be continued to these visible areas. 
F)  Windows and doors. Windows and doors are important architectural elements that create visual interest and are channels for interaction between indoor and outdoor space. Creating repetitive but varied patterns of human scaled windows and doors is an effective way to break down large-scale facades. 
I.  The main entryway must be marked with a prominent entry feature, such as columns, awnings, or a raised architectural element. 
II.  Human-scale doors are encouraged. 
III.  Doors made of glass with surrounding windows are encouraged. 
IV.  Store front displays of goods are encouraged. 
V.  Signs in store front windows that block views into the store are discouraged. 
VI.  Each building must have a minimum of 20 percent glazing (glass covered areas). 
VII.  Tinted and darkened glass is not permitted. 
G)  Roof form. Traditional Southern Vernacular architecture is often defined by the use of parapet walls. Parapet walls increase the sense of presence of the building, screen rooftop utilities, and serve as an opportunity for ornamentation. 
I.  Parapet walls must screen all roof equipment. 
II.  Parapet walls must be made of the same material as the building facade, though the cornice material may vary. 
III.  Metal parapet walls are not permitted. 
IV.  The parapet wall must vary in height at least one foot for every 50 feet of length. 
V.  Decorative variations in the shape and height of the parapet wall are encouraged. 
VI.  As an alternative to using parapet walls, sloped roofs are also permitted. All sloped roofs must meet in a clear roof line or peak. 
H)  Arcades and awnings. All buildings must have either regular arcades or awnings. These are important decorative elements that also provide shade and shelter for pedestrians. 
I.  Arcade regulations: 
a.  Arcades must span at least half of the length of the facade. 
b.  Arcades must be integrated into the building facade and be composed of the same materials as the facade. 
c.  No separate arcades that are attachments to the facade are permitted. 
d.  All arcades must be supported by decorative columns composed of material used elsewhere in the facade. 
e.  Arcades must provide at least eight feet of clear walking distance between the facade and the face of the columns supporting the arcade. 
Regular awnings may be used instead of arcades. 
II.  Awning regulations: 
a.  Awnings must cover at least half the length of the facade. 
b.  Awnings must be rectangular in shape, made of canvas, and of a single color. A second color may be used for store name. 
c.  Canvas awnings must be maintained in good condition. 
d.  The store name may be included on awnings, but no other writing is permitted. 
I)  Site design. 
I.  The main goals for site design in the Belair/Columbia NPOD are to improve the level of landscaping, improve pedestrian circulation, and to break up large parking areas. 
a.  Site designs that place a portion of the parking behind the building are encouraged to break up large parking areas. 
b.  Creating designated pathways and driveways for interparcel access between commercial parcels for pedestrians and vehicles is encouraged. 
c.  The number of curb cuts off of major thoroughfares such as Columbia Road and Belair Road should be minimized, and the distance between curb cuts should be adequate to allow efficient traffic flow. 
d.  All parking areas must have at least one shade tree for every 12 parking spaces. 
(II)  The basic components of site design at the Belair/Columbia NPOD are: 
a.  A streetscape at the front of the site, adjacent to the street. 
b.  A parking area behind the streetscape and in front of the building. 
c.  A retail promenade behind the parking area and directly in front of the building. 
d.  The commercial buildings. 
e.  Loading and other service areas behind the buildings. 
f.  Buffers where necessary at the back of the site. 
(III)  Pedestrian access. One of the goals of the Belair/Columbia NPOD is to improve the quality and safety of pedestrian access. Pedestrian access from the sidewalk and between parcels should be considered during site design, and pedestrian routes must be designated in the site plan. 
a.  Continuous pedestrian access must be provided from the sidewalk to the primary building entrance. 
b.  Pedestrian pathways must be a minimum five feet in width. 
c.  Where a pedestrian route crosses a vehicular circulation area, signs and pavement markings must be provided to indicate to drivers that they are crossing a designated pedestrian route. 
d.  Pedestrian access routes must not involve substantial grade changes or other obstacles to safe pedestrian access. 
e.  If the pedestrian path runs along the edge of a parking area, a minimum three-foot grass or planted buffer must be provided in addition to the five-foot walkway. This ensures that cars do not infringe upon the walkway area. 
J)  Retail promenade. Creating a retail promenade will enhance the shoppers' experience and improve the image of the Belair/Columbia NPOD. The retail promenade consists of a pedestrian area, plantings, and street furniture all provided immediately in front of the building facade. This creates a place for shoppers to walk and possibly take breaks during their shopping experience. 
I.  The retail promenade must be a minimum of eight feet in width, with an average width of ten feet. 
II.  Landscaping and/or street furniture is required on at least ten percent of the retail promenade. 
III.  Paved surfaces shall be of materials that blend with nearby building materials and landscaping materials. Asphalt may not be used for any part of the promenade. 
IV.  Any covered arcade area qualifies as part of the retail promenade. 
K)  Streetscapes. Streetscapes serve to improve the public appearance of the Belair/Columbia NPOD and to enable pedestrian and bicycle access. A consistent streetscape across different properties ties together a unified design theme for the Belair/Columbia NPOD and will help to define it as a gateway to the county. 
(I)  The streetscape consists of three parts: 
a.  A landscape buffer to set the pedestrian area back from the road (street buffer). 
b.  The sidewalk. 
c.  A second landscape buffer to shield the view of parking areas (parking buffer). 
(II)  Streetscape regulations: 
a.  The street buffer must be a minimum of five feet in width. 
b.  Lights must be placed every 40 feet in the street buffer. 
c.  Every other light in the street buffer must be a shorter, pedestrian-style light of a kind that matches the street lights. 
d.  Both pedestrian and street lights must be capable of accommodating decorative banners to mark events or create a sense of a gateway into Columbia County. 
e.  The parking buffer must be a minimum of five feet in width. 
f.  The parking buffer must be planted with continuous shrubs or hedges a maximum of 30 inches in height. 
g.  The parking buffer must have street trees planted every 40 feet on center minimum. 
h.  The sidewalk area must be a minimum of five feet in width, and the five-foot width must be clear of any obstacles. 
i.  All trees planted for streetscape requirements must be four-inch caliper minimum at time of planting. 
j.  Street trees are required along Belair Road and Columbia Road. The Director of Columbia County Planning and Development or his designee shall determine the type or types of trees that are required to be used based upon the site conditions and utility installations in the areas where such trees are to be planted. 
k.  Street and pedestrian lights must be historic and decorative in character. 
L)  Street furniture. The use of high-quality street furniture throughout the Belair/Columbia NPOD will create a sense of long-term investment. Consistent street furniture will help to unify the design character of the Belair/Columbia NPOD. Developers must select street furniture that is similar in design, materials, and color. Street and pedestrian lights must be capable of accommodating banners. 
Specified street furniture includes: 
I.  Street lights. 
II.  Pedestrian lights. 
III.  Planters. 
IV.  Fencing. 
V.  Bollards. 
VI.  Benches. 
VII.  Garbage cans.

III.  Pedestrian light fixtures must be no more than 14 feet in height. 
IV.  Taller lighting is permitted along public roadways where required by the department of transportation. 
V.  White spectrum lighting that preserves true color perception is required. 
VI.  Accent lighting to highlight architectural and landscape elements is encouraged. 
N)  Sign guidelines. Signs, while important, should generally be subordinate to architectural and landscape features. Signs must integrate with architectural features by matching in scale and materials with surrounding buildings. 
I.  All signs must be made of quality, durable materials. 
II.  Signs must coordinate with architecture in terms of materials and scale. 
III.  Development signs mark the entrances to commercial complexes: 
a.  Monument style signs are required with a maximum height of 20 feet. 
b.  The total size of the sign face or message area shall be no more than 200 square feet, and the entire sign structure shall be no more than 300 square feet. 
c.  Listing of individual tenants is discouraged. If a list is provided, consistent foreground and background color must be used throughout the sign and must coordinate with the colors used in the commercial development. 
IV.  Wall-mounted signs are signs posted on buildings to advertise specific stores: 
a.  The maximum letter height may be no more than 20 percent of the facade height or 48 inches, whichever is smaller. 
b.  Wall-mounted signs must align with other facade elements, such as doorways and windows. 
V.  Other sign regulations: 
a.  Each business may have no more than three signs total. 
b.  Signs that are not permitted include billboards, pole signs, banners, neon signs, balloon signs, flashing signs, moveable-type signs, and search lights. 
O)  Buffers and fences. Landscaped buffers are required between any single family residential use and any non-single family residential use as well as between multifamily residential and commercial or industrial uses. 
I.  A 20-foot buffer is required between single family residential uses and any other land use. 
II.  A 20-foot buffer is required between multifamily residential uses and commercial uses 
III.  The landscaped buffer shall consist of a continuous wall of mature evergreen shrubs. 
IV.  Parking, storage, or other similar uses are prohibited in the buffer area. 
V.  An opaque fence six feet in height must also be used for screening at the edge of the buffer. See subsection (f)(2)P.II. for materials which must be used in constructing such fence. 
VI.  Barriers and buffers between commercial properties are not encouraged except where necessary for security. In fact, provisions shall be made to promote pedestrian and vehicular access between adjacent commercial developments. 
P)  Fencing regulations: 
I.  Fencing must be opaque if used for security and privacy purposes. Decorative walls/fences must compliment the architecture of the development. 
II.  Fence/wall materials can be pressure treated natural wood, brick, stucco and stone. Fence and wall finishes should compliment the materials used on the buildings in the development. 
III.  Fencing around detention ponds may be wrought iron, painted aluminum or black vinyl coated chain link with heavy landscaping and the Director of Columbia County Planning and Development or his designee will make the determination depending on site specific design criteria. 
IV.  Screen walls must be high enough to screen dumpsters and utilities up to a maximum of eight feet in height. 
Q)  Other requirements. Commercial developments in the Belair/Columbia NPOD must not present visual blight to any public right-of-way or any residential property. Preventing visual blight can best be done primarily by proper site design and secondarily by screening. The following regulations apply: 
I.  Utility wires must be buried by the developer for any new commercial development with more than 150 feet of frontage on Columbia Road or Belair Road. High voltage utility wires arc excluded from this requirement.

(Code 1979, § 2-16-60; Ord. No. 00-8, § 4, 8-15-2000; Ord. No. 11-07, § 1, 3-1-2011; Ord. No. 17-09 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-5-2017) 
Sec. 90-132. - Nonconforming uses of land and structures. 
(a)  Intent. It is intent of this section to avoid any unreasonable invasion of established private property rights; however, this chapter recognizes that the elimination of existing structures and uses that are not in conformity with this chapter is as much a subject of health, safety and general welfare as is the prevention of the establishment of new uses which would violate the purpose, intent and provisions of this chapter. A structure, building or use which was lawfully established before the effective date of this chapter, or any amendment thereto, and which does not conform to one or more of the requirements of this chapter, is a nonconformity. 
(b)  Continuation in perpetuity. A nonconforming use, building or other structure may be continued in perpetuity, subject to the following conditions that the nonconforming use, building or sign not be: 
(1)  Changed to or replaced by another nonconforming use. 
(2)  Expanded or enlarged in any way. 
(3)  Reestablished, repaired, replaced or rebuilt after damage to the extent of 75 percent or more of its value. 
(4)  Reestablished after discontinuance of operation for one year. 
(c)  Maintenance and repairs. 
(1)  On a nonconforming structure, or portion thereof, which contains a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding 75 percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure, or portion thereof, provided that the bulk existing when such structure became nonconforming shall not be increased. 
(2)  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building, or part thereof, which is declared to be unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
(d)  Nonconforming lots. A lot that was a lot of record prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, which does not meet the minimum area, width or frontage requirements of this chapter, may be used as a building site, provided that access is provided directly from a public street or through a private easement, and provided that minimum building setbacks are not reduced more than 20 percent of the minimum building setbacks set forth in this chapter; provided, however, that the setback shall not be reduced to less than 15 feet from the right-of-way.

Sec. 90-133. - Parking. 
(a)  Off-street parking required. At the time of the establishment of or change to a permitted use as set forth in sections 90-50 and 90-97, or erection of any building, or at the time any principal building is enlarged or increased in capacity by adding dwelling units, guest rooms, seats and/or floor area, there shall be provided permanent off-street parking spaces, improved with an asphalt or concrete surface, in accordance with the following: 
(1)  Combination of required parking space. The required parking spaces for any number of separate uses may be combined in one lot, but the required parking spaces assigned to each use may not be assigned to another use, except where the parking spaces required for churches or other assembly halls whose peak attendance will be at night, on Sunday or another time, does not coincide with an adjacent use, such required parking spaces may be assigned to the adjacent use. 
(2)  Proximity of off-street parking spaces to use. All required parking spaces for all uses shall be either on the same lot or within 300 feet of the building or open use area such parking spaces are to serve; provided, however, that no required parking spaces may be located across any arterial street from the use such parking spaces are intended to serve. 
(3)  Design of parking lots. 
a.  Except for parcels of land devoted to one-family and two-family residential uses, all areas devoted to off-street parking shall be designed and of such size that no vehicle is required to back into a public street to obtain access to such public street. 
b.  Each parking space shall not be less than nine feet wide by 18 feet long, except that handicapped spaces shall comply with the requirements of the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act. 
c.  An off-street parking plan and calculations to include the number of spaces required by code and the number of spaces provided by the applicant shall be required and shall accompany all applications for development approval. 
(4)  Off-street parking by use. The minimum and maximum number of off-street parking spaces required for each type of use shall be determined by the following table, to include the number of spaces required by the Americans with Disabilities Act. The developer can provide parking spaces not less than the minimum amount or up to the maximum amount. The reference to area in square feet relates to the gross floor area of the entire building being served by the off street parking spaces.

(6)  Administrative variation of parking requirements. The number of parking spaces required by this section may be increased or decreased upon approval by the director based on the actual use of a property. 
(7)  Pervious surface requirements. The department director or his/her designee (collectively the "director") may approve an alternative permanent surface material or a substitute for concrete curbs, or both, which the director determines best fits the needs of the parking application. 
a.  In making such a determination the director must find that: 
1.  The alternative surface will not degrade the public street; 
2.  The alternative surface will adequately withstand the anticipated parking demand; and 
3.  The alternative surface will reduce the impervious surface area of the parcel or parking lot. 
b.  The following provisions apply to parking areas where a pervious surface treatment is applied to the area dedicated for surface parking spaces and drive aisles: 
1.  Parking lot areas eligible for pervious or permeable surfaces include parking spaces and access aisles but not driveways, parking lot perimeter roads or heavily used parking access drives. The design engineer is required to demonstrate to the director how the surface design will be satisfactory for the intended use. 
2.  Pervious surfaces include pervious concrete and asphalt, pervious pavers and turf block or other surface treatment approved by the director. 
3.  The stormwater reductions that result from permeable pavement may be considered in any stormwater management plans. 
b.  The following provisions apply to parking areas where a pervious surface treatment is applied to the area dedicated for surface parking spaces and drive aisles: 
1.  Parking lot areas eligible for pervious or permeable surfaces include parking spaces and access aisles but not driveways, parking lot perimeter roads or heavily used parking access drives.

(3)  Protect the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens and others within the county; 
(4)  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazard; 
(5)  Promote the aesthetic qualities of the county; 
(6)  Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
(7)  Promote economic development; 
(8)  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.

b.  For signs that have no identifiable frame or border, the smallest rectangle that includes all of the sign's words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements intended to convey the sign's message shall establish the area of the sign's face. 

c.  For signs applied to a kiosk or other cylindrical sign structure, the area of the sign face shall be computed as the largest rectangular area achieved from any one view of the sign. Measurements shall be made as a flat plane rectangle projected on the sign. 

d.  The computation of the area of a sign face shall not include the structure, supports, or uprights on which the sign face is placed or any portions of a sign structure that are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature, other than those portions contained within the rectangle that delimits the sign face or a sign module. 
e.  Automatic or manual changeable copy signs. For any sign on which any of the words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements are routinely changed or are intended to be changed from time to time, the sign face area shall include the entire area within which any words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements may be placed, together with any frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed. 
(2)  Treatment of open spaces . Any open space contained within the limits of the rectangle delimiting the sign face, sign module, or sign structure shall be included in the computation of the area of such sign face, sign module, or sign structure. For window signs, open spaces or clear backgrounds designed to allow an unobstructed view into a place of business shall not be counted toward the maximum allowable sign face area. 
(3)  Multi-faced signs . 
a.  Double-faced signs. For double-faced signs, when the sign face surfaces are parallel (back-to-back), or where the smallest angle formed between the two faces is 60 degrees or less, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area on the largest side. For double-faced signs where the interior angle formed by the faces is more than 60 degrees, the area of the sign shall be the total area of all sides. 
b.  Signs with three or more faces. For sign structures having only three faces and the interior angle formed between each of the faces is 60 degrees, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area on the largest side. For all other multi-faced signs with three or more sides, the area of the sign shall be the largest total of all faces that are joined by an interior angle of more than 60 degrees that can be viewed from any one direction. 
(i)  Measurement of sign height and distance . 
(1)  Sign height . The height of a sign shall be equal to the vertical distance from the average grade at the base of the sign, or from the crown of the roadway of the nearest street if the street is within 100 feet of any portion of the sign (when measured perpendicular to the street), to the highest point of any portion of the sign, whichever results in the greater sign height. Any earthen berms and elevated foundations supporting signs, signposts or other sign supports shall be included in the height of the sign. 

(2)  Measurement of distance . Minimum distances required hereunder shall be measured along the shortest straight line from the nearest point on a sign structure to the nearest point on a property line, sign structure, building or structure to which the minimum distance requirement applies.

(1)  New construction . Any new building or site improvement must comply with the landscaping and screening requirements of this section. 
(2)  Exceptions . These regulations shall not apply to the construction or renovation of a single-family detached dwelling or two-family dwelling. 
(3)  Maintenance and repair . An existing building or site may be repaired, maintained or modernized without providing additional landscaping or screening, provided there is no increase in gross floor area or improved site area. 
(4)  Additions . 
a.  When an existing use is increased in gross floor area or improved site area by up to 25 percent cumulatively, landscaping and screening is required for the additional floor or site area only. 
b.  When an existing use is increased in gross floor area or improved site area by more than 25 percent cumulatively, both the existing building and site area and the additional floor or site area must conform to the landscaping and screening requirements of this section. 
(5)  Change in use . A change in use only triggers the application of these requirements if a previously-developed site or building has been unused for one year or longer, or when there is a specific use standard requiring landscaping or screening for the new use. 
(b)  Landscape plan required . 
(1)  Before any building permit is issued, the building, use, or site must be found by the director of planning services to be in compliance with all requirements of this section. The director of development services cannot allow occupancy or use of a building until advised by the director of planning services that the building, use, or site meet the requirements of this section. 
(2)  Landscape design and planning must be integrated with the overall design concept for any project; therefore, site plan approval will evaluate landscaping schemes as to their relationship to the existing natural landscape, developed, or proposed landscapes on adjacent properties and the public rights-of-way, and the building or buildings existing or proposed on the subject property and adjacent sites. 
(c)  Landscape strip . 
(1)  Non-residential and multi-family developments are required to maintain a minimum ten-foot wide landscape strip adjacent to any public or private street, or along any common driveway serving the purpose of a public or private street.

e.  Landscape strips wider than ten feet shall be planted with tree and shrub quantities proportional to the width of the strip (e.g. a 20-foot wide landscape strip would require two shade trees for every 40 feet of frontage and two shrubs for every four feet of frontage). 
(3)  Parking spaces, driveway surfaces, and stormwater facilities may not encroach within the landscape strip. Driveway crossings and sidewalks may encroach at the most perpendicular angle as possible. Low-impact stormwater facilities such as bio-swales and rain gardens may encroach within the landscape strip upon the approval of the director of planning services. 
(d)  Street trees . Street trees may be provided as a substitute for a required landscape strip, upon approval by the planning services director, within the Evans Town Center Overlay District (ETCOD) or a Node Protection Overlay District (NPOD), and shall be maintained within, or adjacent to, all existing and proposed street rights-of-way in accordance with the following requirements: 
(1)  Street trees shall be planted at a spacing of 40 feet on-center for shade trees or 20 feet on-center for ornamental and understory trees along the entire length of the street frontage of the proposed development, or as approved by the planning services director based on the development plans. Ornamental and understory trees shall be used as street trees only when there is an overhead obstacle which would preclude the use of taller-growing shade trees. A list of acceptable street trees is available in section 90-145. 
(2)  Street trees shall be planted in a minimum six-foot wide tree lawn between the curb and sidewalk, and shall be planted no closer than three feet from the curb or sidewalk. The planning services director may approve an alternate planting plan to avoid conflicts with utilities. 
(3)  Street trees shall include only those trees listed in the approved list of tree species in section 90-145, unless use of an alternative species is approved by the planning services director. 
(4)  Street trees shall be located in a manner that minimizes conflicts with underground and above-ground utility lines. 
(5)  A street tree planting plan shall be included with the development plan, and shall detail species, placement, size, number of trees, and the party responsible for perpetual maintenance. 
(6)  Street trees shall be installed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the building to which the street trees closest relate. 
(e)  Interior parking lot landscaping . 
(1)  In addition to all other landscape requirements, all parking lots subject to this section shall provide and maintain landscaped planting areas within the interior of the parking lot. These standards shall not apply to parking structures. Each planting area shall consist of at least 180 square feet, or as approved by the administrator. 
(2)  In cases where the area required for the construction of the minimum parking spaces as required by section 90-135 would cause the removal of a historic or heritage tree, the administrator may modify the landscaping requirements and/or the parking requirements in order to preserve the affected historic or heritage tree. 
(3)  Interior planting areas shall be designed within parking areas as: 
a.  Islands located at the end of parking bays; 
b.  Islands located between parallel rows of cars, used to visually separate parking areas into pods;

(4)  Each interior planting area shall contain approved shade trees and be planted at the following rates: 
a.  One shade tree and eight shrubs for every 2,000 square feet, or portion thereof, of the total parking lot area, including drives and service areas. 
b.  Not more than 12 continuous parking spaces shall be allowed in a row of parking without separation by a 180-square foot median containing at least one shade tree. 
(5)  Each parking space must be located within 60 feet of a tree measured from the closest point of the parking space to the tree trunk. 
(6)  Proposed shade trees being used to meet the interior parking lot landscaping requirements shall be located no further than ten feet and no closer than four feet, from the edge of pavement. 
(7)  Existing shade trees may be used to meet the interior parking lot landscaping requirements at the discretion of the administrator if the tree(s) meet the intent of the interior parking lot landscaping requirements and the tree protection requirements. 
(8)  Trees used to comply with interior parking lot requirements shall not count toward the number of trees required to meet the street tree requirements. 
(9)  No more than 25 percent of required shrubs may be deciduous. 
(f)  Alternative landscape plan . At the discretion of the planning services director, alternate landscaping plans, plant material, planting methods, or landscape design may be used where unreasonable or impractical situations would result from application of landscaping requirements, or where necessary to protect existing vegetation, or where a more creative plan is proposed which substantially complies with the intent of these requirements. Landscaping requirements may be reduced if existing trees or other types of existing vegetation are preserved. Alternative plans, materials, or methods may be justified from natural conditions such as streams, natural rock formations, topography, and other physical conditions related to the site. Lot configuration and the presence and location of utility easements may justify an alternative landscaping plan.

1.  Consideration of whether any buildings or structures, parking areas, stormwater facilities, utilities, driveways, or other features of the proposed development can be relocated or designed to retain the specimen tree, and the additional costs of redesign, if any. 
2.  Consideration of whether the land area consumed by the proposed development can be reduced via parking structures, reduction of the building footprint by increasing the building height, placement of stormwater facilities underground, and other appropriate means to retain the specimen tree, and the additional costs involved in the surface area modifications, if any. 
b.  Planning services director approval . The director of planning services will approve or deny the application to remove a specimen tree, after review and recommendation from a certified arborist. The planning services director may issue a permit to remove one or more specimen trees after finding that one or more of the following conditions are met: 
1.  The written analysis provides convincing evidence that alternative site and building designs have been considered by the applicant, but would not result in retention of the specimen tree. 
2.  The additional cost associated with developing the site or constructing buildings as redesigned or reducing the site area consumed to retain one or more specimen trees would be disproportional to the value of the specimen tree retained, calculated at $100.00 per tree density unit. 
3.  Where more than one specimen tree is proposed to be removed, the site design results in the minimum number of specimen trees removed that are necessary to accommodate the proposed development. 
4.  The request to remove one or more specimen trees is reasonable considering the remaining specimen trees on the site that will be retained. 
5.  A variance to the dimensional requirements of the zoning district may be an appropriate remedy to preserve a specimen tree. Where, in the opinion of the planning director, one or more variances would enable a site and building design to be accomplished while saving one or more specimen trees, and where the objectives of tree protection would outweigh the purposes of the dimensional requirements that would be varied, the planning director may suggest an applicant apply for variances instead of proposing to remove one or more specimen trees. A determination by the planning director that one or more variances to the dimensional requirements would not be appropriate may support a finding by the planning director in favor of granting approval to remove one or more specimen trees. 
(3)  Removal of non-specimen trees . 
a.  Removal of non-specimen trees from a site may be allowed at the discretion of the planning services director when: 
1.  The tree is located in an area where a structure or improvement will be placed, and the tree cannot by relocated on the site because of age, species, or size; 
2.  The tree is in an irreversible state of decline, or is structurally unsound and has been rated as a high risk tree by a qualified tree risk assessor; 
3.  The tree is injured or poses an imminent danger, or has been rated as a high risk tree by a qualified tree risk assessor; 
4.  The tree interferes with existing utility service; or 
5.  The tree creates an unsafe visual obstruction for vehicular movement. 
(4)  Site clean-up required . All tree removal companies, utility companies, or persons in the business of construction or removing trees must remove from the site any trees, stumps, limbs, or debris caused by tree removal activities. 
(g)  Variances and appeals . 
(1)  Applicants with a hardship imposed by the standards for tree protection may seek a variance from the standards pursuant to section 90-179. 
(2)  Applicants dissatisfied with a staff decision regarding tree protection may appeal the decision to the planning commission pursuant to section 90-179. 
(h)  Minimum tree density . 
(1)  Minimum . All sites subject to the tree protection requirements must maintain a minimum tree density, measured in units per acre. The term "unit" is an expression of basal area, and is not synonymous with "tree." The tree density requirement must be met whether or not a site has trees prior to development. 
(2)  Required tree density units . Tree density units required vary based on the type of development. 

 
(3)  Methods of achievement . The minimum required tree unit density may be achieved by protecting existing trees and by planting new trees on the site. 
(4)  Calculation of existing tree density . Required tree density units are calculated on the basis of total (gross) area of the site or lot in question, excluding existing easements that are required to be cleared of trees. Only existing trees of not less than three inches DBH left in good growing condition and protected in tree save areas on the site count toward the minimum required tree density units. Protected trees are eligible for tree density credit based on the following table. 

 
(i)  Tree replacement . 
(1)  Tree replacement plan . Trees must be relocated or replaced on site. As many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site. This provision may require planting less trees of a larger caliper than the minimum required caliper. Tree selection and planting shall meet ANSI A300 and Z60.1 standards. 
a.  Separate drawing . A separate tree replacement plan indicating the location of all proposed trees for revegetation is required. This plan must be submitted as a separate drawing, but with the planning services director's approval, may be included as a part of the tree protection plan. 
b.  Planting schedules and species names . The tree replacement plan must include planting schedules with proposed trees species names (botanical and common), quantity, size, spacing, and any special planting notes. 
c.  Overstory/understory ratio . Replanting must be at a ratio of not less than one overstory tree for every three understory trees. Tree density credit may be met by planting all overstory trees, but not by planting only understory trees. 
d.  Diversity . No more than 40 percent of any one genus may be included in any replanting plan. Exceptions to this requirement may be authorized by the planning services director. 
e.  Approved trees . Unless otherwise approved by the planning services director, trees selected for replanting must be on the tree species selection list in section 90-145. Invasive trees are not allowed under any circumstances. Trees selected must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders, or root defects, and must be in good vigor in order to assure a reasonable expectation of survival. It is desirable that replanted trees be ecologically compatible with the site and neighboring sites. Accordingly, replanted trees must be of the same or similar species as those removed, when practical. 
f.  Flowering ornamental trees . The use of flowering ornamental trees or plants classified as large shrubs may be included in the tree replacement plan, but may not be used for the purpose of meeting minimum tree density unit requirements for the site, unless approved by the planning services director. 
g.  Transplanting trees . Standards for transplanting must be in keeping with those established in the latest edition of ANSI A300 (Part 6), and described in the published Best Management Practices: Tree Planting, developed by the International Society of Arboriculture. 
h.  Planting and staking details . Planting and staking details must be provided on the tree replacement plan using International Society of Arboriculture standards. 
i.  Practices . Columbia County encourages environmentally sustainable design practices such as drought-tolerant landscaping, keeping turf away from native trees, and planting trees strategically for energy conservation. 
j.  Debris . All debris from trees cut or substantially damaged must be removed from the site or chipped in a timely fashion, including the removal or chipping of any portion of the tree stump above the original natural grade or elevation of land. 
(2)  Calculation of replacement tree density . Newly planted trees are eligible for tree density credit based on the following table. Replacement trees may include street trees planted in public rights-of-way, either adjacent to or within the site. 

 
a.  A seven-gallon container-grown pine tree is given replacement credit of 0.5 units. 
b.  For tree relocation, replacement units will be granted to trees relocated on site. Tree relocation is subject to approval by the planning services director. 
(3)  Replacement tree size and height . 
a.  All replanted overstory trees must be a minimum of eight feet tall and have a trunk of not less than three caliper inches. 
b.  All replanted understory trees must be a minimum of six feet tall and have a trunk of not less than two caliper inches. 
(4)  Minimum root zone . 
a.  In order to provide sufficient growing area for planted trees, the following minimum criteria must be observed unless otherwise approved by the planning services director: 
1.  Overstory tree: 200 square feet of pervious root zone. 
2.  Understory tree: 75 square feet of pervious root zone. 
b.  Impervious surface area may encroach into no more than 30 percent of the pervious root zone of a tree to be protected or planted, with techniques approved by the planning services director. 
(5)  Permit . No land disturbance permit may be issued until the planning services director has approved the tree replacement plan. 
(6)  Maintenance . All replacement trees must be maintained properly to ensure their survival. 
(7)  Cut or filled slopes . Cut or filled slopes within residential developments and outside of building lots shall be replanted with evergreen trees at a rate of 20 tree density units per acre, independent of the tree density requirement for the overall development. Trees planted to meet this requirement may be counted toward the tree density requirement for the overall development. 
(j)  Tree protection during construction . 
(1)  Materials prohibited in tree save areas . No structure, improvement, or other activity, including solvents, material, construction machinery, portable toilets, construction trailers, or temporary soil deposits may encroach or be placed within a drip line or within six feet of the area immediately outside the drip line of any specimen tree or any tree within a tree save area. 
(2)  Tree protection devices . Before land disturbance, the developer is required to erect suitable protective barriers pursuant to an approved tree protection plan, including tree fences, tree protection signs, and erosion barriers. County inspection of tree protection barriers is required prior to the commencement of any land disturbance or development. Tree protection measures must remain in functioning condition until completion of site landscaping, completion of the project, or until the certificate of occupancy is issued. Authorization to remove the protective devices must be evidenced by approval in writing by the planning services director or issuance of a final certificate of occupancy. 
(3)  Active tree protection devices . Materials for active tree protection must consist of chain link, wooden post and rail fencing, or other equivalent restraining material. In addition to fencing, where active tree protection is required, each tree to be saved must be marked at the base of the trunk with blue colored water-based paint. 
(4)  Passive tree protection . Passive tree protection fencing is to be used only for areas remote from construction activity. Materials for passive tree protection must consist of orange laminated plastic or heavy plastic flagging, a minimum of four inches wide with dark letters reading "Tree Protection Area—Do Not Enter" or equivalent signage on a continuous durable restraint. 
(5)  Additional measures . The developer must take measures to ensure the health of protected trees during construction, including, but not limited to: 
a.  Water, fertilize, and treat the trees for pests or disease, as needed, in accordance with standards of the International Society of Arboriculture. 
b.  Where grading covers the trees with dust, hose them off. 
c.  Do not prune branches so that equipment or structures "fit" within the trees' protected zone. 
d.  Do not strip the topsoil or remove the natural leaf mulch or material from beneath a protected tree. 
e.  Trees should be felled away from, rather than into, tree save areas. 
f.  Provide adequate mulching and water for trees that will be retained. 
(6)  Tree damage . Any tree designated on a tree protection plan to be saved that is damaged during construction or as a result of construction, must be treated according to accepted standards, or replaced with trees equal to the tree density unit value of the tree removed or damaged. Any specimen tree removed or damaged must be replaced with twice the tree density unit value of the tree removed or damaged. Where a damaged specimen tree must be removed, the area occupied by its drip line must remain in a pervious state. A replacement plan must be approved by the planning services director. 
(k)  Tree maintenance . 
(1)  To prevent long-term harm to the health of trees or their structure, all pruning of trees within Columbia County must be done in accordance with ANSI A300 Tree, Shrub, and Other Woody Plant Management Standard Practices (Pruning). 
(2)  On a single lot that contains or is zoned and platted for purposes of constructing a detached or attached house, tree maintenance requirements only apply to specimen trees. 
(3)  "Topping," defined as reduction of tree size using intermodal cuts without regard to tree health or structural integrity, is prohibited. 
(4)  Required tree density must be maintained on the site in perpetuity. Replacement of damaged or diseased trees shall meet the requirements of this section.

If such an appeal is taken by a party directly involved in the action or decision being appealed from (i.e. an applicant, property owner, etc.) it must be filed within 15 days after the date of occurrence of the action or decision being appealed from. If such an appeal is taken by a party not directly involved in the action or decision being appealed from (i.e. a person in opposition to the action or decision being appealed from, etc.) who might not have knowledge of the filing of an application or request for an action or decision being sought by an applicant or property owner, it must be filed within 15 days after the date of the posting of notice on a sign placed on the land in question or the publication of notice of a public hearing on the matter in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, whichever shall occur first. The director shall transmit to the planning commission all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken, and shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal or other matters referred to the planning commission.

(1)  There are special circumstances or conditions unique to the property that do not generally apply in the district. 
(2)  The special circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of any reasonable use of his land. Mere loss in value shall not justify a variance. There must be a deprivation of beneficial use of land. 
(3)  Topographical or other conditions peculiar and particular to the site are such that strict adherence to the requirements of this chapter would cause the owner unnecessary hardship, and would not carry out the intent of this chapter, and that there is no feasible alternative to remedy the situation. 
(4)  If granted, the variance shall be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of this chapter, and shall not be injurious to the neighborhood or detrimental to the public welfare. 
(5)  In reviewing an application for a variance, the burden of showing that the variance should be recommended and/or granted shall be upon the person applying for the variance. 
(6)  When recommending a variance, the planning commission, or the board of commissioners, when granting a variance, may establish reasonable conditions concerning the use of such property, and may establish an expiration date for such variance. 
(7)  Any variance recommended and/or authorized is to be set forth in writing in the minutes of the planning commission and the board of commissioners, as the case may be, with the reasons for which the departure was justified, and the conditions under which the variance was granted. 
(d)  Limitations on variances. A variance shall not be considered or granted from the conditions of approval imposed on a property through a zoning change granted by the board of commissioners; nor may a minimum lot size required in the applicable zoning district be reduced; nor may any use of land or structures be granted that is not permitted by the zoning district that is applicable to the property. 
(e)  Minor waivers. The director or his designee may approve minor setback waivers when the request contains all of the following elements: 
(1)  The request is for a maximum of ten percent reduction of the required front, side and rear minimum building line. 
(2)  No side or rear setback can be less than five feet on any residential lot for detached homes. 
(3)  All minimum building codes are met. 
(4)  No utility services will be affected. 
Approvals or denials must be in writing and sent to the applicant.

1.  The development plan shall specify a phasing plan for all amenities to be provided within the development. The amenity phasing plan shall correspond with the overall development phasing schedule, and shall provide for the reasonable completion of amenities to maximize enjoyment by residents. 
2.  The following site development characteristics shall be determined and set in the approved development plan: 
(i)  Minimum lot area(s); 
(ii)  Minimum lot width(s); 
(iii)  Size(s) and location(s) of yard(s) and setback(s); 
(iv)  Maximum impervious surface ratio for individual lots and the development as a whole; 
(v)  Minimum and/or maximum building density, including total number of residential units and non-residential square footage permitted, broken down by type; 
(vi)  Maximum structure height(s); 
(vii)  Open space shall be provided with all PUDs, and minimum open space shall be set by the development plan. For PUDs incorporating multi-family residential dwellings, a portion of the open space, complementary to the proposed design and lifestyle features of the proposed development, shall be reserved as common open space that shall be designated for the recreational or leisurely use by residents. 
(viii)  Off-street and on-street parking and loading needs and dimensions; 
(ix)  Internal traffic calming strategies; 
(x)  Location, size, and/or amount of bufferyard(s), screening, landscaping, and tree save areas;

3.  Projects shall meet the following design requirements: 
(i)  The minimum side building setback shall be ten feet for all single-family detached units, and on the detached side of all single-family attached units. This minimum notwithstanding, the character of a proposed (or "the proposed" or "a particular") planned residential development may justify smaller side setbacks. Certain development types, including, but not limited to traditional neighborhood development (TND), pocket neighborhoods, and some residential infill solutions may benefit from the use of smaller setbacks to achieve the development concept. The board of commissioners may, where justified by the development concept, approve minimum side building setbacks below ten feet. 
(ii)  The minimum rear building setback will be ten feet. 
(iii)  Residential driveways shall be a minimum of 20 feet long between the garage and sidewalk or back of curb (where sidewalks are not present). 
(iv)  Streets shall be designed as a hierarchy of street types in an interconnected pattern. 
a.  Interconnecting sidewalks with a minimum width of five feet shall be installed on both sides of all streets, and shall meet Public Rights-of-Way Accessibility Guidelines (PROWAG) requirements, latest edition, at all street intersections. A walking trail with a minimum width of eight feet may be installed in lieu of sidewalks along one side of major neighborhood streets where the installation of sidewalks is unnecessary or impractical, as determined by the director of planning services. 
b.  Sidewalk or walking trail locations shall be shown on street types. 
c.  Major neighborhood streets shall converge on neighborhood centers, parks, landmarks, schools, etc. 
d.  Streets and alleys shall terminate at other streets within the development, and shall be "stubbed out" at the edge of the project site to provide linkages with future development. Connections shall be made to "stub outs" on adjacent parcels. The use of dead-end streets and culs-de-sac should be minimized and must be approved by planning commission in cases where site topography necessitates their use. 
(v)  Street trees shall be planted on both sides of all streets (except alleys). 
a.  Street trees shall be planted within a tree lawn with a minimum width of six feet, either between the back of the curb and the sidewalk, or between the sidewalk and the building.

c.  Required street trees shall be installed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the building to which the street trees closest relate. 
d.  Existing tree canopy may substitute for the installation of street trees, where practical, and may be approved by the director of planning services. 
(vi)  Roadway design and stormwater standards shall adhere to environmentally sensitive and aesthetically pleasing best management practices and development standards. 
(vii)  A minimum of ten percent of the usable project area shall be permanently allocated to open space. 
a.  A portion of the required open space shall be centrally located within the development. Location and approximate size of the open space area shall be designated and approved by the planning commission as part of conceptual approval. 
b.  For developments under ten acres, the open space requirement may be satisfied by an existing or proposed public park or trail network that is within 1,300 feet of the development boundary. 
c.  Stormwater infrastructure may not be counted toward the required open space, unless designed as part of a low-impact system that utilizes bio-swales and natural recharge areas.

(viii)  Specific architectural design criteria shall be adopted as part of the overall plan for the site. 
(ix)  Maximum impervious cover for individual building lots shall be specified in the development plan, with stormwater infrastructure designed accordingly. 
(x)  Vegetated bufferyards of a minimum width of 15 feet shall be maintained along a development's exterior boundaries. 
a.  Bufferyards shall be left undisturbed throughout development. 
b.  Bufferyards may count as part of the required open space only if located outside of a building lot. 
4.  Additional criteria for multi-family and single-family attached development: 
(i)  Density counts relate to buildable site area. 
(ii)  Fifty percent of single-family attached units must have access to an attached or detached garage. If detached, the garage must be located to the rear of the primary structure. 
5.  The site development characteristics prescribed by the approved development plan associated with a special, planned unit development, or planned development district shall supplant any conflicting standards for site development established in the Columbia County Code of Ordinances. Any site development characteristics not prescribed in the approved plans for a special, planned unit development, or planned development district shall be subject to the minimum standards, if applicable, established in the Columbia County Code of Ordinances. 
(d)  Revisions. 
1.  Minor changes. Changes proposed in writing by the applicant that do not alter district boundaries and that involve revision of minor characteristics of a PRD, such as relocation of driveways, façade details, drainage structures, number of required parking spaces, and other features that do not materially affect the approved plan concept or violate any other applicable regulations, may be approved by the planning commission. Variations to residential density less than five percent of the initially-approved density constitute minor changes. 
2.  Major changes. Changes proposed in writing by the applicant that alter district boundaries or that materially affect the characteristics or functionality of the PRD, such as changes in the general layout of buildings and their environs on the site, changes to the district regulations, or landscaping shall be submitted under the provisions of section 90-180 pertaining to zoning changes and ordinance amendments, and must be approved by the board of commissioners. Variations to residential density that are five percent or greater of the initially-approved density constitute major changes.
