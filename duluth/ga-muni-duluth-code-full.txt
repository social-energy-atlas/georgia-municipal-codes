PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Duluth, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the mayor and council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan N. Shekitka, Supervising Editor, and Ron McLaughlin, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Ken Pittard, City Clerk, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Any and all additions and amendments to this Code, when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the mayor and council to make the same a part hereof, shall be deemed to be incorporated in this Code so that reference to "The Code of Ordinances of the City of Duluth, Georgia," shall be understood and intended to include such additions and amendments. 
(b)  Manner. All ordinances passed subsequent to the adoption of this Code which amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code may be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion herein, or in the case of repealed chapters, sections and subsections or any part thereof, by subsequent ordinances, such repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby, and the subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed or omitted, in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time that this Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new code of ordinances by the mayor and council. 
(c)  Cite. All sections, articles, chapters or other provisions of this Code desired to be repealed should be specifically repealed by section number, article number, chapter or other number, as the case may be. 
(d)  Language.

The new provisions shall then be set out in full as desired.

(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier, meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement, may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code. For example, the codifier may:

(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles. 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers. 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____," inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code. 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

At the conference or hearing, if requested, the city council or its designee will consider the information presented by the taxpayer and any other information relevant to the refund claim. At the conclusion of the conference or hearing or within thirty (30) days thereafter, the city council or its designee will decide whether or not to grant all or a portion of the taxpayer's claim for a refund. The city council or its designee must then inform the taxpayer of the city's decision within ten (10) days of rendering the decision. 
(e)  Payment of refund. If the refund is allowed, the city will remit the refund to the taxpayer within sixty (60) days of the approval of the refund claim or within sixty (60) days of the entry of a final decision in any action for a refund.

(Ord. of 4-13-98) 
Sec. 2-3. - Sale of parcels of property too small to be used independently. 
The city council is hereby authorized to sell and convey parcels of property owned by the city which are narrow strips of land, so shaped or so small as to be incapable of being used independently as zoned or under applicable subdivision or other development ordinances or as streets whether this property is owned in fee by the city or has been obtained by grant of easement. The property may be sold to abutting property owners where such sales and conveyances facility the enjoyment of the highest and best use of the abutting owner's property. Such sales shall not require the use of the process of an auction or solicitation of sealed bids, however, for any such sale each abutting property owner shall be notified of the availability of the property and shall have an opportunity to present a proposal of purchase for said property to the city. 
Upon receipt of any such proposals from any abutting property owners, the city shall be authorized to negotiate with such property owners, and the city council shall by motion authorize the sale of any such property and establish the terms of such sale. 
(Ord. of 9-14-98) 
Sec. 2-4. - Insolvent list. 
The city clerk is hereby authorized to submit to the city council an insolvent list which shall contain a list of all property taxes determined to be uncollectible. Property taxes shall be considered uncollectible only after the city clerk has made every effort to collect such taxes. Property taxes may be deemed uncollectible for any valid reason including but not limited to the fact that the business or entity owing the taxes is out of business and maintains no property on which to levy, that the taxpayer has moved out of state, has no property on which to levy, and the city clerk is unable to locate the taxpayer, due to a legal decision that the taxes are not owed or that the property that was subject to taxation has been seized lawfully by another entity having priority over the city taxes, that more than seven (7) years has passed since the entry of a tax execution, or that the taxpayer has been adjudged bankrupt and the city clerk was unable to collect the taxes through the bankruptcy proceeding. 
From time to time, but not more frequently than once per year, the city clerk shall establish an insolvent list which shall contain property taxes determined to be uncollectible. Said insolvent list shall be presented to the mayor and council. Said list shall contain the taxpayer's name, the year that the taxes were due, the bill number, the amount of taxes owed, and the reason that the city clerk has determined that said taxes are uncollectible. If the city council for any reason believes that any taxes listed on the insolvent list are capable of further collection attempts, the city council shall direct the clerk to remove those taxes from the insolvent list. Once appropriate revisions have been made, the city council shall approve the insolvent list, and the city clerk shall have no further obligation to attempt to collect the taxes shown on the insolvent list. The fact that property taxes have been determined to be uncollectible and placed on the insolvent list shall in no way relieve the taxpayer of the obligations to pay said taxes provided that said taxes are otherwise lawfully collectible under state law.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 2-46. - Commencement of terms of elected officials. 
The terms of the elected officials of the city shall begin at the first organizational meeting in January following a general municipal election in accordance with the terms of O.C.G.A. § 21-3-63(b). 
(Ord. of 12-27-88) 
Sec. 2-47. - Per diem, lodging, travel and overnight expenses of employees. 
(a)  General travel guidelines. This travel policy is hereby established to facilitate reimbursement for expenses incurred while attending training, meetings, or events that are directly related and necessary to the employee performing their official duties and who will be traveling outside the immediate area for approved city business. Employees are responsible for knowing the city's travel policy and for abiding by the policy. 
Any employee traveling to or attending a training, meeting, or other event held out-of-state which has not been approved through the budget must obtain pre-approval by the department director or city manager prior to such travel. 
Reimbursement for meals within a fifty-mile radius of an employee's regular work location or residence is not allowable, unless expressly provided herein. The daily per diem allowance includes all taxes and meal tips and is divided into breakfast, lunch and dinner amounts in order to allow employees to deduct specific meals, where required. Any meal included in a conference or registration fee will not be reimbursed, and the per diem allowance must be reduced by the applicable meal rate. Any employee seeking reimbursement shall submit a copy of the meeting or conference agenda at the time of making the request in order to confirm which, if any, meals are included. 
(b)  Per diem. Per diem meals and incidental expenses will be reimbursed according to the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA Per Diem) schedule of per diem rates as found at http://www.gsa.gov/perdiem for the metro-Atlanta area. This allowance is intended to cover food, non-alcoholic beverages and out-of-pocket expenses not covered through registration fees while an employee is performing their official duties while outside of the fifty-mile radius of their regular work location or residence, and which requires an overnight stay. An employee may opt to forgo the standard federal per diem rate according to the GSA schedule of per diem and turn in actual receipts for expenses. However, the total of such receipts may not exceed the allowable amount per the GSA per diem schedule. Per diem may be advanced prior to departure based on the GSA rate and the expected number of days of travel. Unexpended per diem is not refundable to the city, unless it is received in advance and travel was less than the expected duration. Receipts need not be kept to support or justify standard per diem. 
For day seminars within the fifty-mile radius, where lunch is not included in the registration fee and prior approval of the department director has been obtained, an employee may receive the lunch per diem or use the city charge card. However, the charge must not exceed the lunch GSA per diem amount. 
For each full day of travel, all three (3) meals are reimbursable. Per diems for the first and last day travel are governed as set forth below. 

 

 
(c)  Required meal deductions. Any meal included in a conference or registration fee will not be reimbursed, and the employee shall be required to deduct the applicable meal rate from any reimbursement request. Required meal deductions include those provided by hotels, meetings, conferences or any other source. If a meal is offered as part of a conference and the employee has medical restrictions, dietary or religious convictions that restrict or prohibit consumption, the employee should make every effort to have the conference facilitate their needs. If the request is not honored, the employee is not required to deduct the applicable allowance amount from the per diem. However, the employee must include a note or other documentation with the per diem request to document this exception. 
(d)  High cost areas. All out-of-state travel should be pre-approved through the budget process. The GSA rates apply to most locations in the continental United States. All exceptions must be authorized/approved by the city manager and must follow the GSA approved per diem rate on the website referenced above for such area of travel. Examples to be considered for higher per diem rates include areas such as Washington, D.C., San Francisco, New York, Boston and Chicago. The purpose of the trip, duration of stay, individual representing the city, and reason for attendance may also be valid factors for exceptions to the standard GSA approved per diem rate. The employee traveling is responsible for requesting the per diem increase ahead of time. 
(e)  Spouse and dependent attendance. Within budget, the city encourages employees to attend functions that are in the best interest of the city. Spousal and dependent attendance can at times enhance the image of the city and is usually encouraged. However, the city cannot expend any public funds for the cost of spouse or dependent attendance while employees are attending meetings, conferences, training, conventions or other city sponsored functions. Therefore, spousal attendance is a personal expense. 
(1)  Prepayments. Where possible, known expenses for spousal or dependent attendance should be paid by the employee in advance of any function so that the city may include the payments with the initial registration. These expenses may include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Registration fees; 
b.  Travel cost; and 
c.  Specific function costs, e.g. dinners, socials, sporting functions, etc. 
(2)  Follow-up expenses. All final expenses for spousal or dependent attendance which were not paid prior to the function must be paid to the city within five (5) days of returning from the function. These typically include: 
a.  Any expenses incurred by a spouse or dependent and charged to the lodging bill; 
b.  Any unexpected travel cost charged to the city and not paid in advance; and 
c.  Any extraneous expenses incurred by a spouse or dependent while on the trip. 
(f)  Accommodations. 
(1)  Outside of fifty-mile radius. The city will pay for overnight lodging expenses outside of the fifty-mile radius of the employee's regular work location or residence for training and conferences. This reimbursement is separate from the per diem detailed above. Accommodations should be in or as close to the conference center as possible. The following procedures are required: 
a.  Employees are required to submit all room receipts. If staying at the convention headquarters hotel, charges are expected to be reasonable and within the range of similar accommodations in the immediate area visited. Employees should ask for and take advantage of special rates offered to convention attendees. If accommodations are not available at the convention headquarters hotel, the city will pay the prevailing rate at an alternate hotel recommended by the convention officials, not to exceed the rate of the headquarters hotel. 
b.  The city is exempt from certain taxes when traveling on behalf of the city and staying in a hotel within the State of Georgia. Employees are responsible for ensuring the hotel/motel tax exemption form and state tax exemption form are presented upon arrival at the hotel. The city will not reimburse for any tax that should have been exempted but for the employee's failure to follow this procedure. 
c.  Employees must check out a city credit card before leaving for a trip and present it at check-in for each overnight in-state trip, as required in order to receive tax exemptions. It is the responsibility of the employee to ensure that all tax exemptions are secured. The city will not reimburse for any tax that should have been exempted but for the employee's failure to follow this procedure. Further, only pre-approved, budgeted expenditures may be charged to the city's credit card. 
(2)  Within fifty-mile radius. The city will not pay or reimburse for overnight lodging expenses within a fifty-mile radius of the employee's regular work location or residence, unless pre-approved through the budget process or by the department director where an employee may have early morning or late night meetings. Prior approval should be obtained in advance of registration to stay at a convention hotel within the fifty-mile radius. As an exception, the city will pay for overnight lodging expenses within a fifty-mile radius when a city strategic planning conference is held and the city directly pays for the lodging. In such situation, mileage may be reimbursed for strategic conferences, using city hall as the beginning point, since reimbursement policies normally do not allow mileage for getting to a place of work. 
(g)  Unique expenses. Occasionally, while on overnight city business, unexpected events arise that are necessary to support the trip. An example of such would be a business meal. Such a function consists of a working meal where a city employee and another individual (or individuals) meet, dine and make decisions concerning issues beneficial to the city. If a business meal occurs while on per diem, a receipt must be turned in to support the claim for additional reimbursement or the charge to the city credit card. It is a judgment call on the employee's part to determine the necessity and worth of the expenditure. Whenever possible, an employee should obtain pre-approval from their immediate supervisor prior to the event. If not pre-approved, and the supervisor subsequently disagrees with the necessity, the employee will not be reimbursed. In such event, the city will be held harmless and [the] employee will remain totally responsible for the full amount of the meal. 
(h)  Reimbursements. Proper documentation is always required for expenses to be reimbursed by the city. Items for proper documentation include, but are not limited to, receipts, meeting agenda, outline of meals by day and meal, and detailed explanations for items that are not ordinary in nature. Documentation and payments with respect to lodging, travel, and the credit card charges are managed by the city clerk's office. Only pre-approved or budgeted items may be charged to the city's credit card. Absolutely no other charges to the city's credit card are permitted. 
(1)  All proper documentation must be attached to an expense report form before submittal to the department director for approval. The city clerk's office will review the reimbursement request and supporting documentation for any irregularities. If irregularities exist, the city clerk's office will address the issue immediately. If extenuating circumstances exist, each such situation will be handled on a case-by-case basis. 
(2)  To support reimbursement claims and/or extra expenses following out-of-town events, an expense reimbursement report must be submitted, along with all necessary receipts, within five (5) business days after returning from a trip. Employees may only be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses incurred while carrying out their official duties. Any unusual but necessary expenses incurred will be paid only after a written explanation is attached to the travel voucher and approved by all appropriate personnel. 
(i)  Exclusions. 
(1)  The city will not pay for any movies, entertainment or similar expenses while an employee is traveling. 
(2)  The city will not pay any fees for sports activities associated with tournaments, etc., regardless of whether such activities are a part of the conference agenda. If the employee wishes to participate, the employee must pay the cost to do so. 
(j)  Transportation and travel reimbursement. Approved modes of transportation include vehicle, air, rail, taxi and public transportation. The method selected by the employee shall be what is the most economically feasible, taking into consideration the value of time. Employees are required to utilize city vehicles when available and practical, unless approval for the use of a personal vehicle or some other form of transportation is obtained from a supervisor prior to the trip. 
(1)  Mileage. Miles traveled in personal vehicles will be reimbursed at the rate established by the Internal Revenue Service guidelines. Medical mileage shall also be reimbursed in accordance with IRS guidelines. All personal vehicle mileage must be substantiated using an internet driving map site, such a MapQuest, Rand McNally, Google Maps, etc. Mileage will be paid from the employees place of work or from the actual point of departure, whichever is less. Reimbursement requests should include the purpose of the trip. Reimbursement requests without the proper documentation will be returned to the requestor for further explanation prior to payment.

Sec. 2-48. - Travel reimbursement of elected officials. 
(a)  General travel guidelines. This travel policy is hereby established to facilitate reimbursement for expenses incurred while attending training, meetings, or events that are directly related and necessary to the elected official performing their official duties and who will be traveling outside the immediate area for approved city business. Elected officials are responsible for knowing the city's travel policy and for abiding by the policy. 
Elected officials shall only be reimbursed for expenses actually and necessarily incurred by the elected official in carrying out their official duties. Reimbursement shall never exceed the actual expenditure incurred by the elected official. 
Elected officials' attendance or travel to training, meetings, or events held out-of-state which are not related to the Georgia Municipal Association (GMA) or National League of Cities (NLC) must be pre-approved by the city council. 
(b)  Meals. Elected officials are expected to take advantage of all meals included in convention and meeting registration fees. Other meals are to be paid based on the reasonable food cost on the area being visited. The city will not pay for alcoholic beverages of any kind. Any alcoholic beverages, spouses or guest meals (including taxes and gratuities) must be deducted from receipts; only the elected official's expenses may be included on the reimbursement request. Tips shall not exceed twenty (20) percent of the meal bill. 
If a meal is offered as part of a convention or meeting and the elected official has medical restrictions, dietary or religious convictions that restrict or prohibit consumption, the elected official should make every effort to have the convention accommodate their needs. If the convention does not honor the request, the elected official may be reimbursed any cost incurred for a suitable meal. However, the elected official must include a note or other documentation with the request to document this exception. 
(c)  Spouse and dependent attendance. Within budget, the city encourages elected officials to attend functions that are in the best interest of the city. Spousal and dependent attendance can at times enhance the image of the city and is usually encouraged. However, the city cannot expend any public funds for the cost of spouse or dependent attendance while elected officials are attending meetings, conferences, training, conventions or other city sponsored functions. Therefore, spousal attendance is a personal expense. 
(1)  Prepayments. Where possible, known expenses for spousal or dependent attendance should be paid by the elected official in advance of any function so that the city may include the payments with the initial registration. These expenses may include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Registration fees; 
b.  Travel cost; and 
c.  Specific function costs, e.g. dinners, socials, sporting functions, etc. 
(2)  Follow-up expenses. All final expenses for spousal or dependent attendance which were not paid prior to the function must be paid to the city within five (5) days of returning from the function. These typically include: 
a.  Any expenses incurred by a spouse or dependent and charged to the lodging bill; 
b.  Any unexpected travel cost charged to the city and not paid in advance; and 
c.  Any extraneous expenses incurred by a spouse or dependent while on the trip. 
(d)  Accommodations. 
(1)  Outside of fifty-mile radius. The city will pay for overnight lodging expenses outside of the fifty-mile radius of the city for training and conferences. Accommodations should be in or as close to the conference center as possible. The following procedures are required: 
a.  Elected officials are required to submit all room receipts. If staying at the convention headquarters hotel, charges are expected to be reasonable and within the range of similar accommodations in the immediate area visited. Elected officials should ask for and take advantage of special rates offered to convention attendees. If accommodations are not available at the convention headquarters hotel, the city will pay the prevailing rate at an alternate hotel recommended by the convention officials, not to exceed the rate of the headquarters hotel. 
b.  The city is exempt from certain taxes when traveling on behalf of the city and staying in a hotel within the State of Georgia. Elected officials are responsible for ensuring the hotel/motel tax exemption form and state tax exemption form are presented upon arrival at the hotel. The city will not reimburse for any tax that should have been exempted but for the elected official's failure to follow this procedure. 
c.  Elected officials must check out a city credit card before leaving for a trip and present it at check-in for each overnight in-state trip, as required in order to receive tax exemptions. It is the responsibility of the elected official to ensure that all tax exemptions are secured. The city will not reimburse for any tax that should have been exempted but for the elected official's failure to follow this procedure. Further, only pre-approved, budgeted expenditures may be charged to the city's credit card. 
(2)  Within fifty-mile radius. The city will not pay or reimburse for overnight lodging expenses within a fifty-mile radius of the employee's regular work location or residence, unless pre-approved by council for circumstances where an elected official may have early morning or late night meetings. Prior approval should be obtained in advance of registration to stay at a convention hotel within the fifty-mile radius. As an exception, the city will pay for overnight lodging expenses within a fifty-mile radius when a city strategic planning conference is held and the city directly pays for the lodging. In such situation, mileage may be reimbursed for strategic conferences, using city hall as the beginning point. 
(e)  Reimbursement. Proper documentation is always required for expenses to be reimbursed by the city. Items for proper documentation include, but are not limited to, receipts, meeting agenda, outline of meals by day and meal, and detailed explanations for items that are not ordinary in nature. Documentation and payments with respect to lodging, travel, and the credit card charges are managed by the city clerk's office. Only pre-approved or budgeted items may be charged to the city's credit card. Absolutely no other charges to the city's credit card are permitted. 
(1)  All proper documentation must be attached to an expense report form before submittal to the city clerk for approval. The city clerk's office will review the reimbursement request and supporting documentation for any irregularities. If irregularities exist, the city clerk's office will address the issue immediately. If extenuating circumstances exist, each such situation will be handled on a case-by-case basis. The city clerk will then obtain one (1) other approval from another elected official and submit to the accounting department for payment. 
(2)  To support reimbursement claims and/or extra expenses following out-of-town events, an expense reimbursement report must be submitted, along with all necessary receipts, within five (5) business days after returning from a trip. Elected officials may only be reimbursed for actual and necessary expenses incurred while carrying out their official duties. Any unusual but necessary expenses incurred will be paid only after a written explanation is attached to the travel voucher and approved by another elected official. 
(f)  Exclusions. 
(1)  The city will not pay for any movies, entertainment or similar expenses while an elected official is traveling. 
(2)  The city will not pay any fees for sports activities associated with tournaments, etc., regardless of whether such activities are a part if the conference agenda. If the elected official wishes to participate, the employee must pay the cost to do so. 
(g)  Transportation and travel reimbursement. Approved modes of transportation include vehicle, air, rail, taxi and public transportation. The method selected by the elected official shall be what is the most economically feasible, taking into consideration the value of time. 
(1)  Mileage. Miles traveled in personal vehicles will be reimbursed at the rate established by the Internal Revenue Service guidelines. All personal vehicle mileage must be substantiated using an internet driving map site, such a MapQuest, Rand McNally, Google Maps, etc. Mileage will be paid from city hall or from the actual point of departure, whichever is less. Reimbursement requests should include the purpose of the trip. Reimbursement requests without the proper documentation will be returned to the requestor for further explanation prior to payment. Under no circumstances should the elected official use the city credit or fuel charge card to put gas in their personal vehicle. 
(2)  Rental cars. Expenses associated with rental cars, i.e. rental expense and fuel will be paid at cost, with receipts provided. Elected officials shall rent mid-size or smaller vehicles, or an appropriate vehicle size based upon the number of employees needing transportation. Expenses associated with exceeding this car class will be the responsibility of the elected official. Elected officials should decline additional insurance coverage offered by rental car companies as the city's insurance covers car rentals.

ARTICLE XI. - IDENTITY THEFT PREVENTION PROGRAM 

Sec. 2-250. - Findings. 
The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") requires a broad category of creditors to implement an identity theft prevention program ("ITPP"). The FTC requirement and regulation is necessary because of section 114 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ("FACT Act"). The FTC has set forth the ITPP requirement in 16 C.F.R. § 681.2. Identity theft is defined as a fraud committed or attempted using identifying information of another person without authority. The city adopts the program set forth in this section to comply with FTC rules and regulations. In drafting its ITPP, the city has considered: 
(1)  The methods it provides to open its accounts; 
(2)  The methods it provides to access its accounts; and 
(3)  Its previous experiences with identity theft. 
Based on these considerations, the governing authority of the city hereby determines that the city is a low to moderate risk entity and as a result develops and implements the streamlined ITPP set forth in this section. 
(Ord. of 7-27-09) 
Sec. 2-251. - Red flags. 
The FTC regulations identify numerous red flags that must be considered in adopting an ITPP. The FTC has defined a red flag as a pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates the possible existence of identity theft. The city identifies the following red flags from the examples provided in the regulations of the FTC: 
(1)  Notifications from consumer reporting agencies. The city does not request, receive, obtain or maintain information about its customers from any consumer reporting agency. 
(2)  Suspicious documents. Possible red flags include:

Progressive sanctions, depending on the severity of the violation, are encouraged but not required. Where the remaining term of the license is less than twelve (12) months, imposition of suspension or probation for a period in excess of the term of the existing license shall be applied to any renewal license. A subsequent violation within a probationary period shall be cause for revocation and/or denial of license renewal. A total of three (3) separate and unrelated violations within twenty-four (24) months, whether or not within a probationary period, shall be grounds for permanent revocation. 
(7)  The hearing officer's decision shall be personally served or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested to the licensee and his attorney, with a copy to the city attorney, within ten (10) business days of the close of the hearing. The decision of the hearing officer shall constitute final action by the city, subject to review upon petition for certiorari to the superior court.

Editor's note— An ordinance of December 11, 2006 amended the Code by adding a new art. V, §§ 9-83—9-86. In order to prevent duplication of section numbers, the new sections have been numbered as 9-84—9-87 at the discretion of the editor. 

Sec. 9-84. - Findings. 
(a)  The uncontrolled use of outdoor sprinkler systems when outdoor temperatures are near or below freezing, and where located near sidewalks and/or streets, present an inconvenience and danger to the safety and welfare of persons using the sidewalks and/or streets. 
(b)  Outdoor sprinkler systems which are left on for an excessive period of time so as to cause puddling of water on sidewalks and/or streets, or which over-spray or spray directly onto sidewalks and/or streets constitute an inconvenience or danger to persons using the sidewalks and/or streets, both by the puddling of water and through the accelerated deterioration of streets. 
(c)  These factors can cause dangerous accidents and accelerated deterioration of public sidewalks and/or streets resulting in additional city expense for repairs. 
(d)  The mayor and council recognize, however, that the use of outdoor sprinkler systems serves a useful purpose and contributes to the beauty of the city, and that the use of outdoor sprinkler systems should not be absolutely denied. 
(Ord. of 12-11-06) 
Sec. 9-85. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to recognize that although outdoor sprinkler systems are proper and necessary, these systems should be reasonably regulated in the interest of public safety and welfare by the establishment of standards for the timing, coverage and use of sprinkler systems. 
(b)  In order to protect the public safety, to protect the public investment in sidewalks and streets, and to provide for orderly and reasonable use of outdoor sprinkler systems, the mayor and council hereby determine that the public health, safety and welfare require the adoption of this article. 
(Ord. of 12-11-06) 
Sec. 9-86. - Operations prohibited. 
It shall be a violation of this article to operate an outdoor sprinkler system when temperatures are at or below freezing. The formation of ice on a public sidewalk or street shall create a rebuttable presumption that the temperature was at or below freezing. It shall also be a violation of this article to continually operate a sprinkler system for excessive periods of time where such sprinkling creates puddling on adjacent public sidewalks and streets, or to operate a sprinkler system in a manner that results in over-spray or spray directly onto public sidewalks and public streets so as to cause an inconvenience and danger to persons and/or result in the accelerated deterioration of public sidewalks and streets. 
(Ord. of 12-11-06) 
Sec. 9-87. - Remedies; penalties. 
(a)  When the director of planning and zoning or his designee determines that an outdoor sprinkler system is being operated in violation of this article, a written violation notice shall be issued to the owner/operator of the sprinkler system setting forth the actions deemed necessary to correct or remedy the violation. 
(1)  If the violation pertains to excessive use or over-spraying the owner/operator shall, within seven (7) days of the violation notice, take such action as is necessary to correct the violation and shall certify to the director in writing the steps that have been taken to correct the violation. 
(2)  If the violation pertains to operating a sprinkler system when temperatures are at or below freezing, the owner/operator upon receipt of oral or written notice, shall immediately discontinue operation of the sprinkler system and shall also take such action as is necessary to remove any hazardous condition from the public sidewalks and streets of the city. 
(b)  When an emergency situation exists, and it is not practical to notify the owner/operator of the violation, the director of planning and zoning or his designee may cause the city to take such action as is necessary to discontinue the operation of the sprinkler system and to remove or, to the extent possible, eliminate the hazardous condition created by operation of the system. In the event that the city removes or remediates the hazardous conditions created by operation of the system, the owner/operator of the sprinkler system shall be responsible for reimbursing the city for the cost of the removal. In the event that any removal fee remains unpaid for a period of thirty (30) days after written notice, the city may pursue any and all civil remedies available to the city at law or in equity to collect the fee. The payment of any unpaid removal fee shall not bar criminal prosecution for any violation of this article. 
(c)  Any person who is convicted of a first offense under this article shall be subject to a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00). Any person who is convicted of a second violation of this article shall be punishable by a fine of one hundred seventy-five dollars ($175.00). Any person who is convicted of a third or any subsequent violation of this article shall be punished by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), and each day that this violation occurs and continues shall constitute a separate offense.

Alarm user means any person, corporation, partnership, proprietorship, or any other entity owning, leasing or operating an alarm system, or on whose premises an alarm system is maintained for the protection of such premises. 
Automatic dial protection device means an automatic dialing device or an automatic telephone dialing alarm system and shall include any system which, upon being activated, automatically initiates to the city police department a recorded message or code signal indicating a need for law enforcement response. 
Cancellation means the process where response is terminated when the alarm company (designated by the alarm user) notifies the city police department that there is not an existing situation at the alarm site requiring police response after an alarm dispatch request.

City means the City of Duluth. 
False alarm means the activation of an alarm system through mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the alarm user, his/her employees or agents, and signals activated to summon law enforcement personnel unless law enforcement response was cancelled by the alarm user or his/her agent before law enforcement personnel arrive at the alarm location. An alarm is false within the meaning of this article when, upon inspection by the city police department, evidence indicates that no unauthorized entry, robbery, or other such crime was committed or attempted in or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a false alarm shall not include an alarm which was activated due to an electrical storm, severe winds or a power outage.

(Ord. of 5-10-10)

(b)  It shall be unlawful to install, maintain, or use an automatic dial protection device that reports, or causes to be reported, any recorded message to the city police department.

Chapter 15 - UTILITIES 
ARTICLE I. - STORMWATER UTILITY 

Sec. 15-1. - Purpose. 
This article shall serve the purpose of establishment up of the City of Duluth Stormwater Utility. 
(Ord. of 6-13-11) 
Sec. 15-2. - Findings of fact. 
The mayor and city council make the following findings of fact: 
(1)  The City of Duluth is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs I and III thereof and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the corporate boundaries of the City of Duluth (hereinafter "the City" or "Duluth"). 
(2)  In promulgating the regulations contained in this article, Duluth is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia and its City Charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal. A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city and surrounding areas. 
(3)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff may: 
a.  Cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within, and downstream of, the city. 
b.  Adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by Gwinnett County thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system. 
c.  Contribute to the potential degradation of the quality of both surface water and groundwater resources. 
(4)  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for implementation of its comprehensive stormwater management program and drainage-related capital improvement needs. 
(5)  The city is required under federal and state regulations [i.e. the Federal Clean Water Act, the city's national pollutant discharge elimination system (hereinafter "NPDES") phase I stormwater permit] to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and stormwater conveyance system into State of Georgia or United States' waters. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to establish a stormwater utility and impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4 and stormwater conveyance system, whether the property is private or public in nature. 
(6)  Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the city's NPDES phase i stormwater permit, the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District (MNGWPD), the city's comprehensive plan and the other applicable regulatory programs will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities above what is currently being spent for stormwater management program implementation, water quality management, drainage system maintenance, floodplain management, capital construction and other program activities. 
(7)  The cost of operating and maintaining the city's stormwater management system and the funding of necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the city's stormwater management program. 
(8)  The professional engineering and financing analysis and related documents prepared by the city's stormwater consultant properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and operational costs as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy. The applicable supporting, project-related documents that are incorporated herein by reference include the following: Stormwater Management Program Assessment and Cost Analysis (Technical Memorandum No. 1 dated January 28, 2011); Stormwater Utility User Fee Recommendations Memorandum (Project Memorandum dated April 25, 2011); and Stormwater Utility Implementation (Technical Memorandum Addendum dated April 25, 2011, or the most recent version). 
(9)  Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the city in concert with other water resource management programs. 
(10)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management system and service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the City of Duluth is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
(11)  The stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management program which results in services being provided to such properties and the owners thereof. The fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the user fee charge should correlate to the stormwater management services provided to that property and the runoff demand that the property imposes on the public drainage system and the city's stormwater management program. 
(12)  The stormwater management needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, businesses, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways even though the benefits may be indirect or immeasurable. 
(13)  A stormwater management program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to implement an enhanced level of service for stormwater management service delivery within the city through stormwater user fee charges, user fees and other mechanisms. 
(14)  The amount of impervious surface on each improved property is the most important factor influencing stormwater runoff characteristics and these characteristics bear a rational nexus to the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city, or to be provided by the city in the future, to that property. As a result, the amount of impervious surface on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge. 
(15)  A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Stormwater utility user fee charges may be designed with specific modifiers to further enhance customer equity, as well as customer understanding of the user fee charge rate structure, while at the same time minimizing the city's customer account management and maintenance efforts. 
(16)  Stormwater utility user fee charges may be supplemented by other types of fees and charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes (SPLOST) and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council. 
(17)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site stormwater control facilities, activities or assets which reduce, or otherwise mitigate, the impact of a particular property on the city's stormwater management program, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or a credit, and such reduction or credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility. Credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the reduction and mitigation of the stormwater runoff impacts from the property. 
(18)  It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, systems or facilities, together with any other supplemental revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems or facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and supplemental revenues shall therefore be deposited into the City of Duluth Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes. 
(19)  In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of the City of Duluth hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund. The city will enact a stormwater utility rate ordinance in the future to establish stormwater utility user fee charge rates for the provision of stormwater management services.

User is defined as any entity that owns and/or uses property, which maintains connection to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the city for stormwater management. 
(Ord. of 6-13-11) 
Sec. 15-4. - Stormwater utility and enterprise fund established. 
(a)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility to be known as the City of Duluth Stormwater Utility, which shall be responsible for stormwater management services throughout the incorporated areas of the city, and which shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of the city's stormwater management systems and facilities and stormwater management services. 
(b)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility enterprise fund in the city budgeting and accounting systems for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the city stormwater management program and stormwater utility, including, but not limited to, rates, charges, and fees as may be established by the mayor and city council from time to time, and other funds that may be transferred or allocated to the stormwater utility. 
(c)  All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater utility enterprise fund in trust; to be expended solely for stormwater management related purposes and services. Stormwater utility revenue shall be used only for operating expenses and/or capital investments of the stormwater utility. However, other forms of revenue and/or financial resources, not accounted for in the stormwater utility revenue, may be allocated as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council to provide supplemental funding to the stormwater management program and for the provision of stormwater management services. 
(d)  The city shall place responsibility with the city manager or his/her designee (hereafter referred to as the stormwater utility manager) for the operation, maintenance and regulation of the stormwater utility and stormwater management program services performed, owned and operated or maintained by the city, and other related assets, including, but not limited to, properties, other than road rights-of-way, upon which such stormwater management systems and facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access and certain equipment used solely for stormwater management. 
(Ord. of 6-13-11) 
Editor's note— City administrator changed to city manager at the direction of the city. 
Sec. 15-5. - Stormwater utility service area. 
(a)  There shall be one (1) stormwater utility service area in the city which shall encompass the municipal boundaries of the City of Duluth. The city has established that all developed parcels within the municipal boundaries receive stormwater management services from the city. Improved/developed properties within the defined service area will receive a stormwater user fee charge bill because they contribute stormwater runoff to the public drainage system; they are directly or indirectly connected to the city's drainage system; and they receive stormwater management services from the city at varying service levels from which they derive some degree of benefit even through the benefit may be indirect and immeasurable. 
(Ord. of 6-13-11) 
Sec. 15-6. - Scope of responsibility for stormwater management systems and facilities. 
(a)  The stormwater utility shall provide stormwater management services for existing and proposed public stormwater management systems and facilities as defined in this article, subject to funding availability and to policy determinations made in the best interest of the public health, welfare and safety and the environment. Additionally, the stormwater utility may accept the responsibility for providing stormwater management services to private stormwater management systems and facilities, acceptance of which conforms to policies established by the mayor and city council or those persons or entities designated by the mayor and city council to set such policies. 
(b)  The city owns or has rights established by written agreements which allow it to operate, maintain, improve and access those stormwater management systems and facilities which are located: 
(1)  Within public road rights-of-way; 
(2)  On private property but within legally dedicated easements granted to, and accepted by, the city; 
(3)  On private property where the city has been granted, by written agreements, for rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other permanent provisions for operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management system facilities located thereon; 
(4)  On land dedicated to, and accepted by, the city solely for the operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management systems and facilities located thereon; or 
(5)  On public land which is owned by the city and/or land of another governmental entity upon which the city has agreements providing for the operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management systems and facilities located thereon.

(d)  The stormwater utility may provide stormwater management services to privately owned stormwater management systems and facilities to ascertain that said facilities are functioning as designed and approved. The stormwater utility may provide for remedial maintenance of said private facilities based upon the severity of stormwater problems and potential hazard to the public health, safety, and welfare and the environment, and in cases where such remedial maintenance is required the city reserves the right to bill the owner or owners of said private facility for the costs of such maintenance. 
(e)  It is the express intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and welfare of people and property in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person, or to any specific property within or outside the municipal boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages or equitable remedies upon the city, its elected officials, officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship. 
(f)  If any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity or change upon property not owned by the city pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of the city, or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit, negligent issuance of a permit, negligent plan approval, or negligent maintenance of any permitted stormwater management system or facility not expressly dedicated to and accepted by the city for further maintenance in an action seeking the imposition of money damages or equitable remedies against the city, its city council members, mayor, officers, employees or agents. 
(Ord. of 6-13-11) 
Sec. 15-7. - Stormwater user fee charges. 
(a)  It shall be the policy of the city that user fee charges for stormwater management services to be provided by the stormwater utility in the designated service area shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services by individual properties and/or the level of service rendered by, or resulting from, the provision of stormwater management services by the city. 
(b)  The basis for calculation of the stormwater user fee charge to all developed property within the city is established in this article. The city shall assign or determine the customer class, amount of impervious area and other pertinent factors as may be needed for the fair, reasonable and equitable allocation of the costs to deliver stormwater management services and to calculate the stormwater user fee charges for all developed properties in the city. 
(c)  Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be structured so as to be uniform within the customer class, and the resultant user fee charges shall bear a reasonable connection, or rational nexus, to the cost of providing stormwater management services. User fee charge rates shall be in addition to other rates, charges, or fees employed for stormwater management within the incorporated areas of the city as defined herein. 
(d)  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater user fee charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by public and private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities, or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities. 
(e)  The stormwater user fee charges shall accrue beginning July 1, 2011 and shall be billed periodically by the city thereafter via a method established by the mayor and city council. 
(Ord. of 6-13-11) 
Sec. 15-8. - Stormwater utility customer classes. 
(a)  The stormwater utility shall establish specified customer classes within the service area to reflect differences in impervious surface and stormwater runoff characteristics; stormwater management program services provided by the city to the stormwater utility customers; and the respective demand that those customers' properties place on the city stormwater management program and drainage system components. All publically owned, developed properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties, unless otherwise exempted. The stormwater utility classes will encompass all developed and undeveloped properties within the city and are defined as follows: 
(1)  The detached single family residential (DSFR) class shall consist of all developed properties classified as DSFR customers per the applicable definition. 
(2)  The attached single family residential (ASFR) class shall consist of all developed properties classified as ASFR customers per the applicable definition. 
(3)  The non-single family residential (NSFR) class shall consist of all developed properties classified as NSFR customers per the applicable definition. 
(4)  The undeveloped class shall consist of properties classified as undeveloped per the applicable definition. 
(b)  Documentation pertaining to the stormwater utility customer classes shall be kept on file in the office of the stormwater utility manager for public inspection. 
(Ord. of 6-13-11) 
Sec. 15-9. - Stormwater utility user fee charge rates. 
(a)  The stormwater utility shall impose a stormwater user fee on all developed properties within the service area in a fair and equitable manner, including, except as otherwise provided herein. The stormwater utility shall apportion the cost of delivering stormwater services to all developed properties based on the demand the property places on the city's stormwater management program, the stormwater services provided by the city to that property and the benefits derived. 
(b)  The mayor and city council shall establish by ordinance the stormwater user fee charge rates, and the billing rates may be modified by the mayor and city council from time to time to meet the financial and operational needs of the Duluth Stormwater Utility. A schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the City Clerk for public inspection. In setting or modifying such rates, it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair, equitable and reasonable, and which, together with other funding sources available to the Duluth Stormwater Utility for services, systems, and/or facilities related to stormwater management are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management program, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other stormwater utility related costs as deemed appropriate by the city. 
(c)  Stormwater user fee charges shall be based upon the total number of equivalent residential units (ERUs) associated with developed properties within the city. Each ERU shall correspond to two thousand six hundred fifty-four (2,654) square feet of impervious surface. 
(d)  Gravel and compacted soil associated with driveways, parking areas, roads and all other areas that consist of these type surface (or near surface) conditions on developed property will be designated as impervious surface and included in the customer's ERU calculation because of the hydrologic response characteristics of these materials. The total surface area associated with these materials will be calculated at eighty-five (85) percent of the total ERUs to reflect the hydrologic response characteristics and infiltration capabilities of these materials. 
(e)  Calculation of user fee charges. The periodic stormwater user fee charges imposed on all developed properties shall be calculated by multiplying the stormwater user fee billing rate (per ERU) times the number of ERUs for each customer account. The number of ERUs that will be utilized to calculate the user fee charge for each customer account shall be in general accordance with the following: 
(1)  DSFR customer class: Each DSFR customer account shall be charged a flat rate of 1.0 ERU except as noted below: 
a.  If a DSFR customer account consists of more than seven thousand nine hundred sixty-two (7,962) square feet of impervious surface (or three 3.0 ERUs), the customer account for that parcel will be charged as per the NSFR calculation described herein. 
(2)  ASFR customer class: Each ASFR customer account shall be charged a flat rate of 0.4 ERU. 
(3)  NSFR customer class: Each NSFR customer shall be charged 1.0 ERU for each 2,654 square feet, or increment thereof, of impervious surface located on the property to establish the total number of ERUs for billing. Fractional ERUs will be rounded to one decimal place to establish the total number of ERUs for billing. 
(4)  Undeveloped land customer class: Undeveloped land shall not be charged a stormwater user fee. 
(Ord. of 6-13-11) 
Sec. 15-10. - Stormwater user fee charge exemptions. 
(a)  Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no developed public or private property located in the incorporated area of the city shall be exempt from the stormwater user fee charges. The stormwater utility user fee charge is not a tax and no exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion, disability, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management program services and facilities. 
(b)  Exemptions to the stormwater user fee charges are as follows: 
(1)  Parcels which contain five hundred (500) square feet, or less, of impervious surfaces shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
(2)  Linear railroad rights-of-way (i.e. tracks, rails, roadbed) outside of the defined yard limits shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction activities undertaken by the rail road company associated with rights-of-way and drainage conveyance systems. However, railroad stations, rail yards, maintenance buildings, and/or other improved property used for railroad operations shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
(3)  City streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges and the stormwater utility shall not charge the city a user fee charge for the city's impervious surface area resulting from the city's impervious surfaces which are owned and/or maintained by the city within the public rights-of-way.
