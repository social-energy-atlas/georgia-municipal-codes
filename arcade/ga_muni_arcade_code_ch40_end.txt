Should the planting season, at the time of removing such old trees, not be conducive to planting new ones, the person or business responsible for having these trees removed will pay the city the purchase price of such trees as are required for replacements. Such monies will be deposited by the city into a special beautification fund to be used by the beautification committee as it recommends. (s)  It shall be unlawful for any person, distributing or causing to be distributed, circulars, handbills, papers, or other printed advertising matter through the city, to throw into or place in any yard, dwelling, or place of business more than one of the circulars, handbills, papers, or printed advertising matter which such person may be distributing. It shall also be unlawful for any person distributing or causing to be distributed circulars, handbills, papers, or other printed advertising through the city, to throw or scatter the same upon any of the streets, sidewalks, alleys, or other public places in the city. (t)  It shall be unlawful for any person to paste, print, nail, tack, or otherwise fasten any card, banner, handbill, sign, poster, advertisement, or notice of any kind, or cause the same to be done, on any curbstone, lamppost, pole, fence wire, bridge, or tree upon any public property within the city, or upon any private property without the written consent of the owner of such property. (u)  No person other than the owner or driver thereof shall deposit any advertising matter in any motor vehicle or stick or otherwise fasten any advertising matter on any part of any motor vehicle. (Code 1992, § 22-101)
