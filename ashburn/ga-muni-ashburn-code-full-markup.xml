         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a complete republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Ashburn, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The number to the left of the colon represents a certain chapter of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This republication was under the direct supervision of John Dombroski, Vice-President of Supplement Services, and Janet Cramer, Electronic Publishing, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

                  Sec. 2-40. - Intent. 
                  It is essential to the proper administration and operation of the City of Ashburn that the members of its governing authority be, and give the appearance of being, independent and impartial; that public office not be used for private gain; and that there be public confidence in the integrity of the governing authority. The governing authority finds that the public interest requires that they protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of the members of the governing authority in situations where a conflict may exist.

                  (2)  Any person with whom a contractual relationship exists whereby the member may receive any payment or other benefits unless the member is receiving a benefit for goods or services in the normal course of business for which the member has paid a commercially reasonable rate;

                  (4)  To receive and hear complaints of violations of the standards required by this division; 
                  (5)  To make such investigation and response to a complaint as it deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated any provisions of this division; 
                  (6)  To hold such hearings and make such inquiries as deemed necessary to investigate and rule upon complaints; 
                  (7)  To report its findings to the governing authority for such action as the governing authority deems appropriate.

                  Sec. 2-81. - Findings. 
                  (a)  The city intends to hire employees who can provide efficient and effective service to the citizens of the city. 
                  (b)  After careful thought and consideration, the city council has determined that it is necessary to take a strong position in opposition to drug use. 
                  (c)  Drug use on the job endangers the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city and city employees. 
                  (d)  The city desires to be a drug-free workplace and intends to implement a drug policy and drug testing program. 
                  (Ord. No. 00-05, § 1, 8-3-2000) 
                  Sec. 2-82. - Policy. 
                  (a)  Purpose. 
                  (1)  The city is concerned for the well-being of all city employees. That concern has led the city to take a strong stand on drug abuse. There is ample evidence that drug use is bad for employee performance. Simply stated, drugs have no place in the city's employ. 
                  (2)  The city believes it has a responsibility to provide a safe, healthy, and productive working environment for all city employees. To accomplish this goal the city must rely on a close manager/employee relationship to surface problems. 
                  (3)  The city endorses efforts to devise high quality standards for drug testing. Such standards will reassure the public and city employees and help reinforce overall the quality of drug testing which impacts the city's ongoing program to address the problems of drug use in the workplace. 
                  (4)  The United States Congress has enacted the Drug-Free Work Place Act of 1988. The purpose of this law is to ensure that work done under federal contract or federal grants is performed in a drug-free environment. 
                  (5)  Drug abuse and use at the workplace are subjects of immediate concern in society. From a safety perspective, users may impair the well-being of all employees, the public at large, and result in damage to city property. Therefore, in addition to prohibiting employees from engaging in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of illegal drugs in the workplace, the city prohibits its employees from engaging in such illegal activities at all times and at all places. Such activities, even during nonworking hours, clearly affect an employee's ability to perform his or her public duties. 
                  (b)  Conditions. The city adopts the following as its drug free policy: 
                  (1)  No employee of this city may illegally engage in the manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance at any time or place, including while at his or her workplace. Such unlawful activity will be considered sufficient grounds for an adverse personnel action, up to and including dismissal from employment. 
                  (2)  Any employee who gives or in any way transfers a controlled substance to another person or sells or manufactures a controlled substance while on or off the job will be subject to discipline up to and including termination. 
                  (3)  The term "controlled substance" means any drug listed in 21 USC 812 and other federal regulations. Generally, these are drugs which have a high potential for abuse. They also include legal drugs which are not prescribed by a licensed physician. Drugs that are legally prescribed but are being abused are also included. 
                  (4)  Each employee is required to inform his or her department head within five days after he or she is arrested or convicted for violation of any criminal drug statute of any jurisdiction, regardless of whether the alleged violation occurred at the workplace or elsewhere. The employee must notify his or her department head and the city manager, in writing, of each conviction. A conviction means a finding of guilt, including a plea of nolo contendere, or the imposition of a sentence by a judge or jury in any federal or state court. 
                  (5)  Failure to comply with any part of this policy will result in serious adverse personnel action, including possible dismissal from employment. 
                  (6)  Any questions that any employee may have concerning this policy should be directed to the city clerk.

                  Sec. 2-83. - Abuse prohibited; right to test. 
                  (a)  Drug and alcohol abuse by city employees is prohibited. This shall include the use of illegal substances, the abuses of prescription medications, and the use or abuse of alcohol during and immediately preceding work hours or while on city premises. 
                  (b)  The city reserves the right to test any and all applicants as potential employees of the city. The determination of the positions to be tested are clearly stated in the policy and program description. Exceptions require the concurrence of the city council.

                  Sec. 2-84. - Preemployment screening. 
                  (a)  The following provisions apply to applicants considered for employment with the city: 
                  (1)  Applicants considered for employment or rehire will be screened for drugs as a routine part of the preemployment physical for specified job classes. Employees who are being considered for reinstatement or who are rehired must also receive a drug test prior to return to work after appeal or assuming new duties. 
                  (2)  Applicants will be requested to sign a consent release form authorizing the designated lab to perform the drug screening and submit the results to the city manager. 
                  (3)  Applicants who refuse to sign the consent release form or who show traces of illegal drugs will not be considered for employment for a period of six months. Applicants who subsequently reapply for employment after the six-month period will again be requested to sign a consent release form and be required to pass a drug screening test that shows no signs of illegal drugs or abuse of prescribed drugs. 
                  (4)  Applicants shall be given only one valid drug screening review within a six-month period. If the first test shows positive, the applicant may elect to pay for a confirmation test. 
                  (b)  Any employee who has been arrested for a drug or alcohol violation may be required to submit to a drug and/or alcohol test. Failure of an employee to report the arrest shall be deemed a violation of this policy and shall subject the employee to immediate disciplinary action, which may include termination of employment. 
                  (c)  Whenever an employee takes a physical exam in relation to his or her employment, continued employment, or return to work following an absence for six weeks or longer, he or she shall be tested for drugs and/or alcohol. 
                  (Ord. No. 00-05, § 1, 8-3-2000) 
                  Sec. 2-85. - Procedures. 
                  (a)  Employees who are requested to submit to a drug or alcohol test will be asked to sign a consent release from authorizing the laboratory, physician, or certified intoximeter operator to perform the test and release the results to the city manager. An employee will fill out a form listing any and all drugs he or she has been prescribed and any other over-the-counter drugs he or she is taking. All results of these tests will be held in the strictest confidence by the city manager. 
                  (b)  Employees who refuse to sign a consent release form or who are identified as having prohibited substances in their system may be disciplined up to and including termination of employment. Any employee tested under this section will be suspended with pay for up to five days pending the results of the tests. 
                  (c)  All samples of body fluids provided in compliance with this policy shall be used only to test for the presence of drugs or alcohol. 
                  (d)  For employees placed on probation following a prior positive drug test, the testing will take place without prior notice at irregular intervals throughout the term of the employee's probation. This testing will in no event be more frequent than twice in any calendar month. Probationary testings shall be directed by the city manager, who shall determine the dates of the probationary test and shall inform the employee when to report for testing.

                  Sec. 2-86. - Disciplinary actions. 
                  (a)  The following employment actions apply when an applicant or employee tests positive pursuant to this division: 
                  (1)  Applicants. Applicants testing positive shall not be employed at the time. Applicants who are denied employment for this reason may reapply for employment after six months from the date of the positive drug test. 
                  (2)  Employees. Employees testing positive shall be subject to one or more of the following employment actions: suspension without pay and/or termination of employment and/or mandatory participation in a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program. All employees not terminated following a positive test shall be placed on probation for one year following the date of testing. All positive results from a drug test will be verified by a confirmation test using the GCMS test. 
                  (b)  Any personnel action taken under this drug testing policy shall be reviewed by the city council and with the advice and counsel of the city attorney at the option of the city manager. 
                  (c)  Failure to comply with any part of the city drug testing program will result in serious adverse personnel action, including possible dismissal from employment.

                  (6)  Felony violations of drug laws. 
                  (e)  While dismissal from employment will occur in most cases, the following factors must be considered prior to taking any personnel action. Strong, mitigating circumstances may provide an opportunity for disciplinary action other than dismissal. The following guidelines shall apply: 
                  (1)  Public safety personnel will be held to a higher standard.

                  (f)  Failure to appear at the designated collection site when directed or other failure to take the test shall subject the employee or applicant to the same sanctions as if the test had been positive. Supervisors must notify the city manager immediately when an employee fails to show for drug testing.

                  Sec. 2-87. - Management and supervisory guidelines. 
                  The guidelines in this section are for use by managers and supervisors at all levels and in all departments. They are intended to provide assistance in the administration of the drug testing program. 
                  (1)  The city encourages any employee who has a drug or alcohol problem to obtain assistance. Therefore, if such an employee has not been required to submit to a drug or alcohol test or has tested negative but in good faith requires assistance for his or her problem, the employee shall be referred to a treatment and counseling program. This voluntary admission shall not be used against the employee. 
                  (2)  Each supervisor is responsible for taking appropriate action whenever an employee's demonstrated judgment or performance seems to be impaired by the possible use of alcohol or drugs. 
                  a.  Supervisors who suspect that an employee is unfit for duty should arrange, if practical, for at least one supervisor to observe and evaluate the employee's behavior. The employee's supervisor should ask the employee to explain why he or she appears unable to perform the job duties. 
                  b.  Should the employee fail to explain the impaired condition to the supervisor's satisfaction and it is still the supervisor's determination that drugs or alcohol may be involved, the supervisor may, upon consultation with designated senior staff/management, accompany the employee or make necessary arrangements for the employee to be taken by another supervisor to the designated lab, physician, or certified intoximeter operator for testing. 
                  c.  If the employee refuses to go, the employee should be warned that he or she will be held accountable for unfit behavior. Additionally, the employee would be disciplined for insubordination. Depending upon the employee's condition, the employee should be taken home and told when to report back to work. The supervisor should exercise caution in committing to any specific disciplinary action prior to consultation with the department head and staff. 
                  (3)  Supervisors will document in writing all incidents, investigations, and actions regarding suspected drug or alcohol abuse. If disciplinary action occurs, a full report by the department head/director should be sent to the city manager. 
                  (4)  When a supervisor observes the manufacture, use, sale, dissemination, or possession of illegal drugs or alcoholic beverages by employees on the job, the supervisor should take the following steps: 
                  a.  Call the sheriff. 
                  b.  Separate all parties involved and take them to a location where they can be questioned by the sheriff department's personnel about the incident, in the presence of another supervisor. 
                  c.  Report the incident to the immediate supervisor. 
                  d.  Upon completing the pending investigation, take the employee home, if necessary. 
                  Following any incident that might fall under these guidelines, it is essential that the immediate supervisor make a detailed record of all actions, observations, statements, and other pertinent facts, to include date, time, location, and witnesses to the incident. The supervisor should not record his or her opinion or conclusion (i.e., the employee appeared to be on drugs) but rather the supervisor should simply state his or her observations (i.e., the employee was hyperactive, argumentative, loud, obnoxious, sweating profusely, pupils were constricted, etc.). This report shall be forwarded to the city manager. 
                  (5)  If an employee has been arrested for a drug-related or alcohol-related offense while off duty, the employee will be required to report the arrest promptly to his or her immediate supervisor. Management should investigate the nature of the offense to determine if disciplinary action is necessary. 
                  (6)  If a supervisor reviews a report and finds that an employee has violated the city's drugs and alcohol abuse policy, the supervisor shall document all available information regarding the incident and shall forward it to the city manager. Documentation shall include, but is not limited to: 
                  a.  Suspected employee's full name. 
                  b.  Times of observed drug or alcohol usage. 
                  c.  Frequency of use, if appropriate (i.e., occasionally, in the parking lot after work). 
                  d.  Specific locations of use, such as in a specific house or car. 
                  e.  Other participants or witnesses. 
                  f.  Any unusual behavior that would indicate that the observed individual was intoxicated or under the influence of a controlled substance. 
                  (7)  The employees of the city police department, covered employees as defined by the Department of Transportation, 49 CFR 192, 193, or 195, any other person operating hazardous machinery, or anyone operating a vehicle in his or her official capacity shall be subject to additional rules and policies related to drug and alcohol testing, consistent with the general purposes of these rules and attached to Ordinance No. 00-05 and made a part of this antidrug program policies and procedures adopted August 21, 1990, and revised August 1999. Additional rules for certain employees are implemented due to the high levels of employee performance required, the public interest, and visibility of the employees, and responsibility for the protection of life and property. Additional rules and policies shall include unannounced random drug testing, including temporary employees in this category, to determine the presence of prohibited drugs. 
                  (8)  Records of all drugs/alcohol test analyses, observation records of supervisors, and any other administrative reports relating to drug and/or alcohol use or abuse by an individual employee shall be maintained in a separate locked file available only to the city manager or to the city manager's designee, or to any persons who have an official need-to-know basis for requesting these documents. This information shall not be released to any outside person, agency, or department.

                  (c)  Purchases totaling more than $500.00 but less than $2,500.00.

No purchase shall be made without the documentation of three formal proposals or comprehensive documentation of the fact that only one or two suppliers chose to respond to the request. In such cases where fewer than three formal proposals are received, the city manager should contact other local government organizations who have engaged in similar projects to determine if the proposals received are reasonable and valid. 
                  (f)  Purchases of more than $25,000.00. Purchases of more than $25,000.00 shall require a formal bidding process determined by the city manager and approved by the City Council of Ashburn. The process shall include at a minimum: the formal advertisement of specifications being available, formal requests of known suppliers of goods or services required, stringent published deadlines for submittal, published public meeting for the opening of proposals, documentation of references for firms, and acceptance of a proposal with no substitutions. 
                  (g)  Purchases which can be made through the state contract shall be assumed to be in compliance with the above guidelines and may not require any further proposals. Discretion shall be used by the city manager in the decision to utilize state contract as the procurement source for the city, making certain a good or service may not be purchased from a lower cost responsible bidder. 
                  (h)  Splitting a purchase to avoid the procurement guidelines is strictly prohibited and a cause for action against an employee under the personnel policies. Changes to contracts or purchase orders should be subjected to the same controls and approvals as the original agreement. Claims shall be made by the city against vendors regarding documented shortages, or substitutions of lesser quality.

                  The purpose of this chapter is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this chapter represents a balancing of competing interests: Reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

Additionally, a second fence 18—24 inches in distance from the inner pen must be erected around the perimeter to guarantee complete isolation of the quarantined animal from other animals and human contact. The total construction costs of this confinement area is the sole responsibility of the pet owner. Previously vaccinated dogs and cats whose rabies vaccination has lapsed from more than 30 days are considered unvaccinated and will be treated as such. 
                  (2)  Vaccinated dogs and cats exposed to rabies. Dogs and cats that are currently vaccinated (vaccinated at least one month prior to exposure) should be re-vaccinated immediately, confined, and observed for 45 days. Confinement must be coordinated with and approved by Turner County Health Department. 
                  (3)  Livestock exposed to rabies. Vaccinated livestock (vaccinated by a licensed veterinarian with a USDA approved vaccine for that species at least 30 days prior to the attack) bitten by a rabid animal should be re-vaccinated immediately, confined, and observed for 45 days. Confinement must be coordinated with and approved by Turner County Health Department. 
                  (4)  Other animals exposed to rabies. Unvaccinated animals bitten by a rabid animal should be euthanized immediately. If an animal has been vaccinated with a USDA approved vaccine for that species, the animal must be re-vaccinated immediately and placed in confinement for a minimum of 90 days. Confinement must be coordinated with and approved by Turner County Health Department.

It shall be the dog control officer's duty to investigate and classify as appropriate suspected dangerous or potentially dangerous dogs. It shall be the dog control officer's duty to investigate and classify when any report of an occurrence involving a dog that is kept or housed or lives permanently within the corporate limits of the City of Ashburn which warrants or may warrant classification as a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog is received whether that incident is alleged to have taken place within the corporate limits, within Turner County, or in some other jurisdiction.

                  (b)  In the event that the dog control officer classifies the dog under investigation as "dangerous" or "potentially dangerous," the dog control officer must notify the owner(s) by certified mail. The notice shall include a summary of the reason for which the animal has been classified and provide the owners with a form to request a hearing to contest the classification within 15 days of the notice date.

Within ten days after the hearing, the city council shall make a final determination as to the classification of the dog and provide notice of its determination by certified mail to the owners. In the event that the city council, after a hearing, classifies a dog as "dangerous" or "potentially dangerous," the effective date of such classification, which shall be the date the decision is made, must be given.

                  (c)  Owners of classified dogs must notify the dog control officer within 24 hours if the dog is on the loose, unconfined, has attacked a person, has died, or been sold or donated. If the dog has been sold or donated, the owner shall also provide the dog control officer with the name, address, and telephone number of the new owner of the dog.

                  (d)  An owner of a classified dog shall keep the dog in a proper enclosure unless restrained by a strong leash and accompanied by a responsible person. Dangerous dogs when not adequately enclosed must also be muzzled when outside the enclosure.

                  Sec. 14-180. - Management of animals that scratch or bite humans. 
                  (a)  Dogs and cats. A healthy dog or cat that bites or scratches a person or another animal should be confined and observed for ten days. This required quarantine applies to dogs and cats only. Rabies vaccine should not be administered during the observation period. While in confinement, any signs of illness should be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian. The place of confinement shall be at the veterinarian clinic or agency designated by the city as the animal shelter at the expense of the owner or person having custody of possession of the animal, the veterinarian chosen by the owner or person having the custody or possession of the animal at the owner's expense, or any other confinement location so designated and approved by the city. If symptoms suggestive of rabies are observed, the animal should be humanely killed, and a specimen should be submitted to a qualified laboratory for testing. If the animal dies during the quarantine period, the specimen should be submitted immediately for rabies testing. 
                  (b)  Stray domestic animals and other species. Any stray or unwanted animal that bites or scratches a person or domestic animal may be humanely euthanized and a specimen submitted for testing. Animals other than dogs or cats that bite or scratch a person and are suspected of being rabid should immediately be reported to the county health department. Management of animals other than dogs and cats is dependent on the animal species, the circumstances of the bite, and the epidemiology of rabies in the area and shall be at the discretion of the animal control officer or the county health department or their authorized representative. 
                  (c)  Livestock. Cattle, horses, mules, donkeys, goats, swine, and sheep are not likely to be carriers of rabies. Treatment will be weighed against the circumstances of exposure by the animal control officer or the county health department or their authorized representative. If at the time of exposure the animal is clinically ill with signs suggestive of rabies, the animal control officer or his authorized representative, or an authorized representative from the county health department, will immediately and humanely kill the animal and a specimen will be submitted to a qualified laboratory for testing. The cost of testing will be the responsibility of the animal owner, if known.

                  Sec. 14-181. - Management of animals exposed to rabies. 
                  (a)  Generally. Any animal bitten or scratched by a bat or wild carnivorous mammal (particularly bobcat, raccoon, fox, skunk, or coyote) which is not available for testing should be considered exposed to rabies. 
                  (b)  Unvaccinated dogs and cats exposed to rabies. Unvaccinated or unwanted dogs and cats bitten or scratched by a known or potentially rabid animal should be humanely euthanized immediately. If the owner of the animal is unwilling to have this done (upon approval of the department head of the county health department and the city) the exposed animal must be placed in strict isolation for six months and vaccinated one month prior to being released. The responsibility for isolation of an exposed unvaccinated animal remains with the owner. The animal must be kept in a pen that has been built to the specifications of the state rabies control manual, appendix C, and approved by the department head of the county health department and the city. Additionally, a second fence 18 to 24 inches in distance from the inner pen must be erected around the perimeter to guarantee complete isolation of the quarantined animal from other animals and human contact. The total construction cost of this confinement area is the sole responsibility of the pet owner. Previously vaccinated dogs and cats whose rabies vaccination has lapsed for more than 30 days are considered unvaccinated and will be treated as such. 
                  (c)  Vaccinated dogs and cats exposed to rabies. Dogs and cats that are currently vaccinated (vaccinated at least one month prior to exposure) should be revaccinated immediately, confined, and observed for 45 days. Confinement must be coordinated with and approved by the county health department. 
                  (d)  Livestock exposed to rabies. Vaccinated livestock (vaccinated by a licensed veterinarian with a USDA approved vaccine for that species at least 30 days prior to the attack) bitten by a rabid animal should be revaccinated immediately, confined, and observed for 45 days. Confinement must be coordinated with and approved by the county health department. 
                  (e)  Other animals exposed to rabies. Unvaccinated animals bitten by a rabid animal should be euthanized immediately. If an animal has been vaccinated with a USDA approved vaccine for that species, the animal must be revaccinated immediately and placed in confinement for a minimum of 90 days. Confinement must be coordinated with and approved by the county health department.

                  Whenever in the judgment of the city council, after consultation with the county health department, the public health and safety so require, the council shall declare and establish a quarantine zone or area consisting of the whole or any part of the city and maintain such quarantine therein until such time as they may deem it advisable to lift the same. During the existence of such quarantine, it shall be unlawful for any person to violate any of the rules and regulations prescribed by the city council with reference to such quarantine.

                  (a)  If the animal control officer or poundkeeper operating a pound for the city suspects that any animal impounded has rabies, he shall notify the county animal control department. A qualified veterinarian shall examine such animal and if the veterinarian believes such animal should be held for future observation, the veterinarian shall so inform the animal control officer. 
                  (b)  If an animal is found to be afflicted with rabies, the animal control officer or agency operating the pound for the city shall confine the animal as directed. 
                  (c)  If an animal does not have rabies, the animal control officer or agency operating a pound for the city shall release it or dispose of it in the manner prescribed in this chapter.

                  (b)  It shall be unlawful for any person to perform a cruel act on any animal; nor shall any person harm, maim, or kill any domestic animal, or attempt to do so, except that a person may: 
                  (1)  Defend his person or property, or the person or property of another, from injury or damage being caused by an animal; or 
                  (2)  Kill any animal causing injury or damage to any livestock or poultry. 
                  (c)  The method used for killing the animal in the situations outlined in subsection (b) of this section shall be designed to be as humane as is possible under the circumstances.

                  (d)  This section shall not be construed to limit in any way the authority or duty of any law enforcement officer or animal control officer. 
                  (e)  It shall be the duty of the animal owner, caretaker, or possessor to provide adequate shelter, food, water, and sanitary conditions at all times; and to provide necessary medicare care including, but not limited to, the required annual rabies inoculation.

                  Sec. 34-2. - Duty of police officers—Persons violating city ordinances. 
                  Any police officer of the city shall arrest and confine in the county jail, when necessary, any offender against ordinances of the city, where such arrest and confinement is necessary to secure such offender's appearance before the municipal court to answer for an offense, or where it is necessary to preserve the peace and good order of the city, or such police officer may take bond as otherwise provided in section 19-50 of this chapter.

                  Sec. 34-6. - Service of summons generally. 
                  Summons directed to any offender shall be served personally by some member of the police force. 
                  Sec. 34-7. - Procedure for service of process on corporations. 
                  (a)  In addition to any other means provided by law, corporations may be served in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
                  (b)  Whenever any charge shall be preferred against a corporation doing business in the city for violation of this Code or other ordinance of the city, the city clerk shall issue an original and copy notice to the defendant corporation of the charge against such corporation, specifying the time when such charge shall be heard by the municipal court of the city, which copy notice shall be served by the chief of police or any police officer of the city, or the sheriff of the county, at least ten days before the time fixed for trial in the municipal court upon any officer or such corporation to be found in the city, or upon any agent of such corporation, or employee in charge of the business of such corporation, in the city. The officer serving such copy notice shall make an entry of such service on the original notice and return the notice to the municipal court of the city.

                  (a)  If a defendant fails to appear before the municipal court at the designated date and time, the judge of the municipal court shall have the authority to charge the defendant with contempt of court, which offense shall carry a fine not to exceed $200.00, and to issue a bench warrant for the arrest and confinement of such defendant. The period of confinement shall continue until such time as the defendant posts bond and pays the fine(s) outstanding on the pending charge(s) or until the defendant's case can be heard by the court. 
                  (b)  If any person summoned as a witness before the municipal court shall fail, neglect, or refuse to attend the trial, the judge of the municipal court shall have the authority to issue a rule nisi requiring the witness to show cause at a time and place stated therein why the witness should not be held in contempt of court. After hearing from the witness, the judge shall have the authority, if in his or her judgment the reason for non-attendance is insufficient, to hold the witness in contempt of court and punish the offense by a fine not to exceed $200.00 and/or imprisonment for a time not to exceed ten days, either or both, or in the alternative. 
                  Sec. 34-10. - Continuances. 
                  Where the ends of justice may require, all cases may be continued. Applications for continuance shall be addressed to the sound discretion of the court, under the rules governing in the superior courts of the state. All motions in the municipal court for a continuance of any case where the defendant is at liberty on bond shall be made by the defendant, the defendant's attorney at law or attorney in fact, which designation shall not include the surety of defendant's appearance bond. Where an appearance bond has been forfeited and the forfeiture is subsequently set aside for cause, no further motion to continue the case for trial shall be entertained until a forfeiture fee as set forth in schedule of fees and charges has been paid. 
                  Sec. 34-11. - Holding defendant when court lacks jurisdiction. 
                  If, after an investigation of any case, it should appear that the municipal court has no jurisdiction to determine it, the municipal court judge or the mayor shall require the defendant to enter into bond conditioned to appear before the next term of the court having jurisdiction, to answer such offense, which bond shall be turned over to the proper officer of such court. In default of such bond the municipal court judge or the mayor shall have power to commit the defendant to jail to answer the offense at the next term of court having jurisdiction thereof. 
                  Sec. 34-12. - Rules of practice. 
                  The city shall have the opening and conclusion in each case unless the defendant introduces no evidence. The defendant shall then be entitled to the conclusion. The city shall announce first if it is ready for trial; and, if not, it shall be held to as strict a showing for continuances as the defendant. The rules of evidence and examination of witnesses shall be the same as in the superior court, so far as such rules are applicable to the case on trial. All officers, informers, and persons injured shall be competent witnesses. In general, the municipal court shall be controlled by the rules of practice governing the superior court, so far as they are applicable to municipal courts, and by a sound construction of the Charter and ordinances of the city.

                  Sec. 34-15. - Contempt. 
                  Any person who, during a session of the municipal court, shall be guilty of a contempt of court or who refuses to abide by any sentence or order of the court shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $200.00 or ten days in jail. 
                  Sec. 34-16. - [Municipal court additional penalties.] 
                  (a)  In every case in which the Municipal Court of Ashburn, Georgia, shall impose a fine, which shall be construed to include costs, for any offense against a criminal or traffic law of this state or any ordinance of the City of Ashburn, there shall be imposed upon such fine and costs an additional amount equal to ten percent of the fine and costs.

If the officer determines from investigation or inspection that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes, is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes, or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may issue and file in the municipal court a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties for such property, dwelling, building, or structure.

                  (1)  In cases involving structures or buildings on the property, if the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove said dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of these two sub-paragraphs, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. The income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in Chapter 39A of Title 43 of the O.C.G.A., qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  (3)  In cases involving violations other than buildings or structures on the property, the court shall order the owner or other person before the court to abate the condition by mowing, cutting, or removal, as the case may be. No officer or member of the city council or employee of the city, charged with the enforcement of this article in the discharge of duties, shall be rendered liable personally; and such officer, member, or employee is hereby relieved from all personal liability for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of duties under this article. 
                  (e)  If the owner or other person before the court fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, or to abate the condition, as the case may be, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure, to be repaired, altered, improved, to be vacated and closed, and/or demolished, or the conditions existing in violation abated as provided in said order. Such abatement action shall commence within 270 days after the expiration of the time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action must commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes and endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (f)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the city are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (g)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the city, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (1)  The lien provided for in the foregoing paragraph shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, demolition, or other abatement in the Office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Turner County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under section 38-64 of this article. The clerk of Superior Court, as required by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-9(b)(1), shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of Turner County and shall enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. 
                  (2)  Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this article, the public officer responsible for enforcement actions under this ordinance shall transfer to the city tax collector a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within 90 days of completion of the repairs, demolition, closure, or other action.

                  Sedimentation means the process by which eroded material is transported and deposited by the action of water, wind, ice or gravity. 
                  Soil and water conservation district approved plan means an erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan approved in writing by the Middle South Georgia Soil and Water Conservation District. 
                  Stabilization means the process of establishing an enduring soil cover of vegetation by the installation of temporary or permanent structures for the purpose of reducing to a minimum the erosion process and the resultant transport of sediment by wind, water, ice or gravity. 
                  State general permit means the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit or permits for stormwater runoff from construction activities as is now in effect or as may be amended or reissued in the future pursuant to the state's authority to implement the same through federal delegation under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, 33 U.S.C. Section 1251, et seq., and O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f). 
                  State waters means any and all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage systems, springs, wells, and other bodies of surface or subsurface water, natural or artificial, lying within or forming a part of the boundaries of Georgia which are not entirely confined and retained completely upon the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation. 
                  Structural erosion, sedimentation and pollution control practices means practices for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by utilizing the mechanical properties of matter for the purpose of either changing the surface of the land or storing, regulating or disposing of runoff to prevent excessive sediment loss. Examples of structural erosion and sediment control practices are riprap, sediment basins, dikes, level spreaders, waterways or outlets, diversions, grade stabilization structures and sediment traps, etc. Such practices can be found in the publication "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia." 
                  Trout streams means all streams or portions of streams within the watershed as designated by the Wildlife Resources Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources under the provisions of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20, in the rules and regulations for Water Quality Control, Chapter 391-3-6 at www.gaepd.org. Streams designated as primary trout waters are defined as water supporting a self-sustaining population of rainbow, brown or brook trout streams designated as secondary trout waters are those in which there is no evidence of natural trout reproduction, but are capable of supporting trout throughout the year. First order trout waters are streams into which no other streams flow except springs. 
                  Vegetative erosion and sedimentation control measures means measures for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by covering the soil with:

                  (3)  Such minor land-disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion; 
                  (4)  The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre and not otherwise exempted under this paragraph; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and this paragraph. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this paragraph, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of subsection (b) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and the buffer zones provided by this paragraph shall be enforced by the local issuing authority; 
                  (5)  Agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. § 1-3-3, "definitions," to include raising, harvesting or storing of products of the field or orchard; feeding, breeding or managing livestock or poultry; producing or storing feed for use in the production of livestock, including but not limited to cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep, and rabbits or for use in the production of poultry, including but not limited to chickens, hens and turkeys; producing plants, trees, fowl, or animals; the production of aqua culture, horticultural, dairy, livestock, poultry, eggs and apiarian products; farm buildings and farm ponds; 
                  (6)  Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt forestry practices cause or result in land-disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in subsections 38-139(c)(15) and (16) of this article, no other land-disturbing activities, except for normal forest management practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period of three years after completion of such forestry practices; 
                  (7)  Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture; 
                  (8)  Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within 200 feet of the bank of any state waters, and for purposes of this paragraph, "State Waters" excludes channels and drainage ways which have water in them only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water in them year-round; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre, which involves land-disturbing activity, and which is within 200 feet of any such excluded channel or drainage way, must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which such project is located and provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the local issuing authority from regulating any such project which is not specifically exempted by paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (9) or (10) of this section; 
                  (9)  Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority; or any road construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided, however, that construction or maintenance projects of the department of transportation or the state road and tollway authority which disturb one or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to provisions of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7.1; except where the department of transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the state road and tollway authority is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case a copy of a notice of intent under the state general permit shall be submitted to the local issuing authority, the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; 
                  (10)  Any land-disturbing activities conducted by any electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power; except where an electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; and

                  (Ord. No. 12-05, § III, 10-4-2012) 
                  Sec. 38-139. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in [subsections] (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia," published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 12-05, § IV, 10-4-2012) 
                  Sec. 38-140. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Ashburn, Georgia, without first obtaining a permit from the zoning administer to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the zoning administer and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 38-139(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 38-139(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6) [of this section], have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 38-139(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance.

                  Editor's note— Ord. No. 09-04, arts. 1—6, adopted Aug. 6, 2009, amended art. II in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former art. II, §§ 46-31—46-42, 46-61—46-64, and 46-91—46-95, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from an ordinance adopted Oct. 2, 1997. 

                  DIVISION 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

                  Sec. 46-31. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia, and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a), have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Ashburn, Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
                  (Ord. No. 09-04, art. 1, § A, 8-6-2009) 
                  Sec. 46-32. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of Ashburn, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 09-04, art. 1, § B, 8-6-2009) 
                  Sec. 46-33. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. No. 09-04, art. 1, § C, 8-6-2009) 
                  Sec. 46-34. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this article are: 
                  (1)  To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects; 
                  (5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before August 3, 2009 [the effective date of the initial FIRM for that community]. 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before October 2, 1997 [the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
                  Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads.

                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is:

For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after October 2, 1997 [the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after October 2, 1997. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood modernization maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis; 
                  (2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
                  (3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are NOT exempt from any article requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  DIVISION 4. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 46-81. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater; 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 46-82. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 46-81(4), "Elevated buildings." 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 46-73(7). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
                  1.  Individual lots or parcels; 
                  2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (reference subsection 46-81(6) above). 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections 46-82(3)a. [and] c. above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-52, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4.

                  Sec. 46-83. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-52, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 46-52, then the building department shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 4. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following subsections (2) and (3) shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 46-81(4) "Elevated buildings." 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The building department shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  Sec. 46-101. - [Variance procedures.] 
                  (a)  The planning advisory commission as established by the City of Ashburn shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
                  (b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building department (Mike Mastrario) in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the planning advisory commission may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Turner County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the planning advisory commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The building department shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the planning advisory commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  Sec. 54-62. - Designation process. 
                  When a building, structure, site, or object appears to meet the criteria outlined in subsection (3) of this section, the following procedures must be undertaken in order to designate a historic property and/or historic district: 
                  (1)  Application for designation. Designations may be proposed by the HPC, the mayor and city council, a historical society, a neighborhood association, a group of property owners for the designation of a district as historic, or a property owner for the designation of his or her property as historic. 
                  (2)  Recommendation by HPC. The designation of a historic district or historic property may only be considered by the mayor and city council upon the recommendation of the HPC. Upon receipt of the HPC's recommendation and a copy of the historic resource report and analysis of the proposed historic district or historic property under the criteria established in subsection (3) herein, the HPC and the mayor and city council shall schedule a public hearing to consider the proposed designation. The city clerk's office shall provide notice of a public hearing in the same manner as set forth in subsection (3) herein. 
                  (3)  Public hearing requirement. The HPC and the mayor and city council will hold a public hearing on any proposed ordinance for the designation of any historic district or property within the city. Per the provisions of the Georgia Historic Preservation Act, O.C.G.A. 44-10-26, notice of the hearing shall be published in at least three consecutive issues of the principle newspaper in local circulation, and written notice of the hearing shall be mailed by the city clerk's office to all owners and occupants of such properties. All such notices shall be published or mailed not less than ten and no more than 20 days prior to the date set for the public hearing. A notice sent via United States mail to the last known owner of the property shown on the Turner County Tax Roll and a notice sent via United States mail to the address of the property to the attention of the occupant shall constitute legal notification to the owner and occupant under this chapter. 
                  (4)  Mayor and city council action on HPC recommendations. Following the public hearing, the mayor and city council may approve, modify, or disapprove the recommendation. If approved or approved with modifications the mayor and city council may adopt a designation ordinance for the proposed historic district or historic property. 
                  (5)  Required components of a designation ordinance. An ordinance designating a historic district or historic property shall: 
                  a.  Describe the boundaries of a proposed historic district; 
                  b.  List each property in a proposed historic district or describe the proposed individual historic property, including the map and parcel number and address of each property; 
                  c.  Set forth the name(s) of the owner(s) of the designated property or properties; 
                  d.  Require that a certificate of appropriateness be obtained from the HPC prior to any material change in appearance of a designated property; and 
                  e.  Require that the property or district boundaries be shown on the official zoning map of the city. 
                  (6)  Modification or withdrawal of proposed designations. Any recommendation to modify or withdraw the proposed ordinance for designation shall be made by the HPC within 15 days following the public hearing and shall be in the form of a resolution to the mayor and city council. 
                  (7)  Notification to historic preservation division. No less than 30 days prior to making a recommendation on any ordinance designating a property of district as historic, the historic preservation commission must submit the historic resource report to the historic preservation division of the department of natural resources. 
                  (8)  Notification of adoption of designation ordinance. Within 30 days following the adoption of the ordinance for designation by the mayor and city council, the owners and occupants of each designated historic property, and the owners and occupants of each structure, site, or object in a historic district, shall be given written notification of such designation by the city clerk's office, which notice shall apprise said owners and occupants of the necessity of obtaining a certificate of appropriateness prior to undertaking any material change in appearance of the historic property designated or within the historic district designated. A notice sent via United States mail to the last known owner of the property shown on the Turner County Tax Roll and a notice sent via United States mail to the address of the property to the attention of the occupant shall constitute legal notification to the owner and occupant under this chapter. 
                  (9)  Notification of other agencies regarding this designation. The HPC shall notify all necessary agencies within the city and Turner County of the ordinance for designation, including the local historical organization(s). 
                  (10)  Effect of designation. After designation by the mayor and city council, a historic district or historic property shall be subject to the procedures and regulations contained in this chapter. Unless otherwise specified, the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, as amended from time to time, shall apply as the design guidelines for the historic district or historic property. These procedures, regulations, and design guidelines shall be in addition to the provisions of other articles of this chapter, and other regulations of the city that shall remain in full force and effect. 
                  (11)  Moratorium on applications for alteration or demolition while designation ordinance is pending. If a designation ordinance is being considered, the mayor and city council shall have the power to freeze the status of the involved property. 
                  (12)  Local historic district established. The boundaries shown on attachment A are hereby designated as the Ashburn Local Historic District. A plat showing the boundaries of such historic district is on file in the office of the city clerk and is incorporated in this article by reference as fully as if set forth verbatim.

                  (a)  After the designation by ordinance of a historic property or historic district, no material change in the appearance of such historic property, or of a building, structure, site, or object within such historic district, shall be made or be permitted to be made by the owner or occupant thereof, unless or until the application for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted to, and approved by, the HPC. 
                  (b)  Under no circumstances shall any permit for alteration, demolition, or construction be issued by other city or county departments until a certificate of appropriateness application has been approved for such work.

                  Sec. 54-82. - Application requirements. 
                  All applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall be made as required by the HPC and shall at a minimum contain the following information: 
                  (1)  Elevation drawings and material samples. Every application or review involving the construction of a new building or structure and alterations and/or additions to existing structures in any historic district or to a historic property shall be accompanied by exterior elevation drawings drawn to a specific scale and signed by an architect, engineer or other appropriate professional and submitted in sufficient number of copies as required by the HPC. Said exterior elevation drawings shall clearly show in sufficient detail the exterior appearance and architectural design of proposed change(s) to buildings or structures and new construction, as applicable. Each application shall also indicate proposed materials. 
                  (2)  Photographs. Photographs of all sides of the affected existing building(s) or structure(s) visible from the street shall accompany all applications, as well as photographs of adjoining properties. Photographs of all sides of the building visible from the street shall accompany applications for the demolition of structures under consideration for demolition, as well as photographs showing contiguous properties. 
                  (3)  Site plan and landscaping plan. For every application, a plot plan or site plan drawn to a specified scale shall be submitted which shows all improvements affecting appearances visible from the street, such as walls, walks, terraces, plantings, tree protection areas, accessory buildings, signs, lights and other elements. In the case of a building or structure demolition, the site plan and landscaping plan shall show how the foundation area will be restored. 
                  (4)  Additional information. Any additional information as may reasonably be required by the HPC shall be submitted with the application. 
                  Where, in the opinion of the HPC, a requested change would be considered minor, the HPC may vary or waive any of the information requirements of this section for applications for a certificate of appropriateness.

                  Sec. 54-83. - Review criteria. 
                  When considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Historic Preservation Projects, including the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, and the city design guidelines for the local historic district, attached hereto as attachment B shall be used as guidelines. In addition, the HPC shall consider: 
                  (1)  The effect of the proposed work on the property upon which such work is to be done; 
                  (2)  The relationship between such work and other buildings, structures, or objects on the landmark site or other property in the historic district. In evaluating the effect and the relationship, the HPC shall consider historical and architectural significance, architectural style, design arrangement, texture, and materials; 
                  (3)  The HPC shall not have review authority over alterations to the interiors of a building or structure, but it shall study such plans as they relate to the exterior. The HPC shall not have review authority over paint colors used on the exterior of designated buildings; 
                  (4)  A rehabilitation should relate properly to the original components of a building and the surrounding neighborhood. It is important to maintain existing old-growth trees in a rehabilitation within a historic district or historic property; 
                  (5)  Design standards for new construction and additions focus attention on those special visual and spatial qualities that a historic district and historic property is established to protect. Since architectural styles and details vary within a district, the standards emphasize the relationship among buildings in the immediate setting.

                  Sec. 54-84. - Additional criteria for new construction. 
                  When the applicant wishes to undertake new construction within a historic district or on the site of a historic property, the HPC shall consider the compatibility of the new construction with the existing character of the historic district or the historic property. However, the HPC shall not dictate the architectural style of the new construction. Compatible design shall mean architectural design and construction that will fit harmoniously into the historic district or on the historic property's site. The HPC shall include the following points in its consideration of a certificate of appropriateness application for new construction: 
                  (1)  Scale: height and width; 
                  (2)  Massing and building form; 
                  (3)  Setbacks;

                  (9)  Entrances and porch projections; 
                  (10)  Roof forms; and 
                  (11)  Maintaining quality within the historic district or on the historic property's site.

                  (a)  The HPC shall have the authority to deny a certificate of appropriateness application for demolition or relocation. 
                  (b)  A public hearing shall be scheduled for each certificate of appropriateness application for demolition or relocation. The applicant shall prove through substantial, competent evidence, that the demolition or relocation is necessary, including in the evidence presented: 
                  (1)  Alternatives to demolition or relocation such as planned development districts; 
                  (2)  Whether the building or structure can be retained on the site; 
                  (3)  Whether relocating the building or structure is appropriate and feasible; 
                  (4)  Whether the applicant has the ability to build proposed new construction within a reasonable period of time if the application is approved; and 
                  (5)  Whether the demolition is justified as an undue hardship. 
                  (c)  The HPC shall not grant certificate of appropriateness for demolition or relocation without reviewing at the same time the post-demolition or post-relocation plans and/or intentions for the site. 
                  (d)  Additional criteria on certificate of appropriateness applications for relocation. When the applicant wishes to relocate a building or structure designated a historic property, or relocate a building or structure into or outside of a historic district, the HPC shall consider: 
                  (1)  The contribution the building or structure makes to its present setting; 
                  (2)  Whether there are definite plans for the site to be vacated; 
                  (3)  Whether the building or structure can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity; and 
                  (4)  The compatibility of the building or structure to its proposed site and adjacent properties. 
                  These considerations shall be in addition to the points contained in subsection (b) of this subsection.

                  Sec. 62-41. - Distribution of obscene materials. 
                  (a)  A person commits the offense of distributing obscene materials when he sells, lends, rents, leases, gives, advertises, publishes, exhibits or otherwise disseminates to any person any obscene material of any description, knowing the obscene nature of the materials, or offers to do so, or possesses such material with the intent to do so. The term "knowing" shall be deemed to be either actual or constructive knowledge of the obscene contents of the subject matter; and a person has constructive knowledge of the obscene contents if he has knowledge of facts which would put a reasonable and prudent person on notice as to the suspect nature of the material; however, the character and reputation of the individual charged with an offense under this law and, if a commercial dissemination of obscene material is involved, the character and reputation of the business establishment involved may be placed in evidence by the defendant on the question of intent to violate this section. Undeveloped photographs, molds, printing plates and the like shall be deemed obscene notwithstanding that processing or other acts may be required to make the obscenity patent or to disseminate it. 
                  (b)  Material is obscene if: 
                  (1)  To the average person, applying contemporary community standards, taken as a whole, it predominantly appeals to the prurient interest, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion; 
                  (2)  The material taken as a whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value; and 
                  (3)  The material depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined in this subsection (b)(3): 
                  a.  Acts of sexual intercourse, heterosexual or homosexual, normal or perverted, actual or simulated; 
                  b.  Acts of masturbation; 
                  c.  Acts involving excretory functions or lewd exhibition of the genitals; 
                  d.  Acts of bestiality or the fondling of sex organs of animals; or 
                  e.  Sexual acts of flagellation, torture or other violence indicating a sadomasochistic sexual relationship. 
                  (c)  Any device designed or marketed as useful primarily for the simulation of human genital organs is obscene material under this section. 
                  (d)  Material not otherwise obscene may be obscene under this section if the distribution of the material, the offer to do so, or the possession with the intent to do so is a commercial exploitation of erotica solely for the sake of their prurient appeal. 
                  (e)  It is an affirmative defense under this section that dissemination of the material was restricted to: 
                  (1)  A person associated with an institution of higher learning, either as a member of the faculty or a matriculated student, teaching or pursuing a course of study related to such material; or 
                  (2)  A person whose receipt of such material was authorized in writing by a licensed medical practitioner or psychiatrist. 
                  (f)  Any materials declared to be obscene by this section and advertisements for such materials are declared to be contraband. 
                  (g)  The use of any premises in violation of any of the provisions of this section shall constitute a public nuisance.

                  Sec. 62-71. - Prohibited. 
                  (a)  A person commits the offense of loitering or prowling when he is in a place at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. 
                  (b)  Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impractical, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer failed to comply with the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern. 
                  (c)  It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter, loaf, wander, stand or remain idle, either alone and/or in consort with others, in a public place in such manner so as to: 
                  (1)  Obstruct any public street, public highway, public sidewalk, or any other public place or building by hindering or impeding or tending to hinder or impede the free and uninterrupted passage of vehicles, traffic or pedestrians. 
                  (2)  Commit in or upon any public street, public highway, public sidewalk or any other place or building any act or thing which is an obstruction or interference to the free and uninterrupted use of property or with any business lawfully conducted by anyone in or upon or facing or fronting on any such public street, public highway, public sidewalk or any other public place or building, all of which prevents the free and uninterrupted ingress, egress, regress in, on and to, such place or building. 
                  (d)  When any person causes or commits any of the conditions enumerated in subsection (c) of this section, a police officer or any law enforcement officer shall order that person to stop causing or committing such conditions and to move on or disperse. Any person who fails or refuses to obey such orders shall be guilty of a violation of the section.

                  DIVISION 4. - CONDITIONS OF STREET OCCUPANCY 

                  Sec. 74-70. - Failure to comply. 
                  Failure to comply with the terms and conditions set forth in this article may result in revocation of registration and removal of facilities from the rights-of-way. 
                  (1)  Standards. The 1988 Utility Accommodation Policy and Standards Manual, including all references contained therein to codes, rules, regulations, schedules, forms and appendix items, except Appendix B (Permit Forms and supporting Document), promulgated by the State of Georgia Department of Transportation, as may be amended from time to time is hereby adopted by reference and incorporated in the article as if fully set forth herein, subject to the amendments and modification contained in this article. A copy of the manual shall be maintained at the offices of the city manager or his designee and open for public inspection. Any conflicts between the provisions of this article and the manual shall be resolved in favor of the manual. References to State personnel, agencies, and fees shall be interpreted, where required, as meaning the city of municipal equivalents. 
                  (1)  Protection of traffic and roadway. In conformance with city policy, no utility may occupy the city rights-of-way unless sufficient space is available so that the free flow and safety of traffic and other capacity considerations are not unduly impaired and the installation does not prevent the department from reasonably maintaining the streets, structures, traffic control devices and other appurtenant facilities, and further provided that maintenance and operations of the facilities do not jeopardize the traffic, street structure, other users of the right-of-way, or the right-of-way itself. 
                  (3)  Grading. If the grades or lines of any street within the city right-of-way are changed at any time during the term of the permit and this change involves an area in which the utility's facilities are located, then the utility shall, at its own cost and expense and upon the request of the city upon reasonable notice, protect or promptly alter or relocate the facilities, or any part thereof, so as to conform with such new grades or lines. In the even the utility refuses or neglects to so protect, alter, or relocate all or part of the facilities, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter, or relocate all or any part of the facilities without any liability to the utility and the utility shall pay to the city the costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alteration, or relocation. 
                  (4)  Installation of poles and other wireholding structures and relocation. Unless otherwise provided in a valid service agreement, no placement of any pole or wireholding structure of the utility is to be considered a bested interest in the right-of-way, and such poles or structures are to be removed, relocated underground, or modified by the utility at its own expense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The facilities shall be so located and installed as to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners.

                  (1)  Provide information satisfactory to the city that the utility's obligations for its facilities in the rights-of-way under this article and any other provision in the Codified Ordinances or other laws have been lawfully assumed by another utility; or 
                  (2)  Submit a written proposal to re-use its facilities; or 
                  (3)  Submit a written proposal for abandonment of facilities. Said proposal must be approved by the city manager; or 
                  (4)  Remove its entire facilities within a reasonable amount of time and in a manner acceptable to the city; or 
                  (5)  Submit to the city, in good faith and within a reasonable amount of time, a proposal for transferring ownership of its facilities to the city. If a utility proceeds under this clause, the city may, at its option do one or more of the following: 
                  a.  Purchase the facilities; 
                  b.  Accept donation of some or all facilities; or 
                  c.  Require the utility to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the city for its reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in removing the facilities. 
                  (b)  Facilities of a utility who fails to comply with the above subsection shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to abating the nuisance; taking possession of the facilities, evicting the utility from the right-of-way; prosecuting the violator; and/or any other remedy provided by city ordinance or otherwise at law or in equity.

                  The registration statement shall remain in place for one year and renew each subsequent year automatically unless the utility is in default. The city manager shall give written notice of default to a utility if it is determined that a utility has: 
                  (1)  Violated any provision or requirement of the issuance or acceptance of a registration application or any law of the city, state, or federal government; 
                  (2)  Attempted to evade any provision or requirement of this chapter;

                  Sec. 74-74. - Failure to cure a default. 
                  If a utility fails to cure a default within 20 working days after such notice is provided to the utility by the city, then such default shall be a material breach and city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity to terminate the approval of registration. If the city manager decides there is cause or reason to terminate, the following procedure shall be followed: 
                  (1)  City shall serve a utility with a written notice of the reason or cause for proposed termination and shall allow a utility a minimum of 15 calendar days to cure its breach. 
                  (2)  If the utility fails to cure within 15 calendar days, the city may declare the registration terminated.

                  ARTICLE I. - PROPERTY TAXATION 

                  Sec. 78-1. - Administration. 
                  (a)  Except as otherwise provided in this article, the city clerk (ex-officio treasurer, tax receiver, tax collector) shall be charged with the duty to administer the imposition, collection, and enforcement of all taxes and special assessments levied or imposed by the city in accordance with the administrative procedures hereinafter set forth. To the extent this article fails to provide a designated procedure, said officer shall act in the manner established, if any, for county tax collectors under applicable state law. 
                  (b)  In determining the fair market value of property within its taxing jurisdiction, the city shall use the fair market value as finally determined for the property for county ad valorem tax purposes. 
                  (c)  Following adoption of its current fiscal year budget, the mayor and city council shall, by resolution, adopt a millage rate upon which property subject to ad valorem tax will be billed. Prior to adoption of said millage rate, the governing body shall publish the notice of any proposed ad valorem tax rate as required by O.C.G.A. § 48-5-32. Millage rates shall be calculated using 40 percent of the assessed fair market value of the property upon which the tax is levied. 
                  (d)  The city clerk shall cause a bill to be sent to all taxpayers at the address last shown on the county tax digest by regular U.S. Mail, with adequate postage thereon; provided, however, failure by the taxpayer to receive a bill shall not constitute grounds for nonpayment or late payment of the tax. The bill shall state the location or description of the property taxed, the fair market value of the property (100 percent), and its taxable value (40 percent of fair market value), and the amount of tax due thereon. The bill shall also state the due date after which taxes shall be in default. The bill may also contain such additional information as allowed by law or authorized by the mayor and city council. 
                  Sec. 78-2. - Due date; payment; interest on past due taxes. 
                  (a)  All ad valorem taxes shall be due and payable in full within 60 days after notice, unless the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which case it shall be postponed until the first day following which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Supplemental ad valorem taxes and special assessments shall be due and payable on the date set forth in the ordinance imposing the tax or assessment. 
                  (b)  All taxes and assessments imposed by the city shall be paid in full in legal tender of the United States; except where specially authorized by law or ordinance of the mayor and council, no partial payments shall be accepted. 
                  (c)  Taxes and special assessments shall bear annual interest at the rate of three percent above the federal prime rate. In 2016, this rate shall be .542 percent assessed each month from the date the tax or assessment is due until the date the tax or assessment is paid. For purposes of this section, any period of less than one month shall be considered to be one full month. The city clerk may waive the collection of any interest, in whole or in part, due the city on unpaid taxes or assessments whenever or to the extent that he/she reasonably determines that the delay in payment was attributable to the action or inaction of his/her department. 
                  (Ord. No. 16-06, § 1, 8-4-2016) 
                  Sec. 78-3. - Penalties. 
                  (a)  All penalties imposed by this article are part of the tax or assessment and are to be collected as such. The proceedings to collect the original tax, the tax constituted from penalties imposed, and the interest shall all be conducted in the same manner. Any provision of law for criminal prosecution shall not operate to relieve any taxpayer of any tax, penalty, or interest imposed by this article. 
                  (b)  In any instance in which any taxpayer fails to pay a tax or assessment within 120 days of the due date, the taxpayer shall pay a penalty of five percent of the amount of the tax due, together with interest as specified herein. Where the taxpayer continues to fail to pay a tax or assessment beyond the initial 120 days, this penalty shall increase by five percent every 120 days, however the maximum penalty that may ever be imposed is 20 percent of the principle amount due. 
                  (c)  The mayor and council may waive, in whole or in part, the collection of any amount due as a penalty under this ordinance to the extent said body finds and determines the default giving rise to the penalty was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect or disregard of this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 16-06, § 2, 8-4-2016) 
                  Sec. 78-4. - Executions on delinquent taxes and assessments. 
                  (a)  As soon as the last day for the payment of taxes and assessments has arrived, the city clerk shall notify in writing the taxpayer of the fact that the taxes have not been paid and that, unless paid within 30 days, an execution shall be issued. 
                  (b)  The city clerk shall issue executions for the non-payment of taxes and assessments at any time after 30 days have elapsed since giving notice as provided in subsection (a) immediately above. The execution shall identify the defendant in fi.fa. (taxpayer), the year(s) for which delinquent taxes are being executed, and the amount thereof. Executions shall be directed to "all and singular sheriffs and constables of the state." 
                  (c)  The city clerk shall cause all executions issued to be recorded on the general execution docket of the county where the property is located, in the case of real property, and, in the case of personal property, in the county of the taxpayer's residence if a resident of the state, otherwise in the county where any real or personal property of the taxpayer may be found. If the taxpayer is not a resident of the state and has no known real or personal property within the state, the execution shall be recorded in the county in which the act or activity giving rise to tax liability took place. 
                  (d)  All executions issued shall continue to bear interest and penalties at the rates established in this article for past due taxes and assessments. 
                  (e)  The city clerk shall cause all executions issued to be placed in the hands of the city marshal for collection or levy and sale of property. The marshal shall exercise his best efforts to collect the full amount of taxes and assessments due, together with all interest, penalties, and any costs due thereon, from the defendant in fi.fa. In the event he is unable to do so, the marshal shall levy the execution on a sufficient amount of the defendant in fi.fa.'s property, whether real or personal, to satisfy the obligations due at a sale to be held and conducted in accordance with this article. 
                  Sec. 78-5. - Levy of executions; sale of property. 
                  (a)  The chief of police of the city is hereby designated as marshal of the city and delegated the duties set forth in this article. The marshal shall be subject to being ruled for money in his hands arising from the public sale of any property pursuant to process issued by the municipality. After first paying the city clerk the amount due on the process under which the sale was made, the marshal shall pay any surplus to any lawful claimant holding an interest subordinate to the lien for taxes, else to the defendant in fi.fa. 
                  (b)  In all cases of levying on real property, within five days of such levy written notice of the levy must be given personally, or delivered by certified mail, to the defendant in fi.fa. and to any tenants in possession. If the land is unoccupied, a copy of the notice of levy shall also be conspicuously posted on the land. In the case of personal property, the marshal shall enter the same on the execution and plainly describe the property levied on and the amount of the interest of the defendant in fi.fa. therein. 
                  (c)  Whenever any real property is levied upon for taxes or assessments, it shall be the marshal's duty before proceeding to advertise the property for sale to give 20 days' written notice of the levy to the record owner(s) of the property and the holder of each security deed of record. The 20-day period shall begin to run from the time the notice is personally delivered or, when delivered by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, from the date of mailing. The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the owner(s) of the land, the year or years for which the taxes were assessed, and a statement of the amount of the taxes due, together with accrued costs. The marshal shall keep a copy of the notice on which he shall enter the date the notice was delivered or mailed and how, where, and to whom the notice was delivered. The marshal shall file the copy with the city clerk. 
                  (d)  When a levy is made upon real or personal property, the property shall be advertised and sold by the marshal in the same manner as provided for executions and judicial sales; provided, however, in addition to such other notice as may be required by law, the defendant in fi.fa. shall be given at least ten days' written notice of such sale by registered or certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the taxpayer at the last known address listed in the records of the county tax commissioner. In addition, if the United States has a claim or lien on the property subject to being sold and such lien was filed or recorded more than 30 days before the proposed sale, the marshal shall cause written notice of the sale to be given to the secretary of the treasury or his delegate not less than 25 days before the sale. Notice may be given either by personal service or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. 
                  (e)  The marshal shall publish weekly for four consecutive weeks in the official legal organ of the county in which the sale will be conducted an advertisement of the date, place, and hours during which the sale will be conducted, together with a full and complete description of the property to be sold, making known the name(s) of the owner(s) of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state the property is being sold for collection of taxes due to the city and the year(s) for which taxes have been executed. 
                  (f)  Sales of property under execution shall be made by the marshal before the City Hall on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. eastern standard time or eastern daylight savings time, whichever is applicable, and at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash; provided, however, should the first Tuesday of the month fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sales shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. The purchaser shall look for himself as to the title and soundness of all property sold under tax executions and neither the marshal conducting the sale, nor the City of Ashburn, shall make any representations or warranty of title, condition, or fitness for a particular purpose, expressed or implied. 
                  (g)  The marshal shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash and, upon collection of the sales price, make a deed or bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who becomes the purchaser of any property sold at the sale, who fails or refuses to comply with the terms of sale when requested by the marshal to do so, shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money. It shall be the option of the marshal either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and then proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. A tax deed for real property, or bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered as evidence of a sale for taxes conducted pursuant to this article shall convey the title as effectually as if the sale were made by the person against whom the process was issued. Sales of personal property shall be final; real property sold by virtue of an execution issued for the collection of taxes or for any special assessments is subject to redemption rights of the defendant in fi.fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property at the time of levy and sale. Recitals in a deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the instrument. The marshal shall put the purchaser in possession of the property so sold; provided, however, the purchaser of real property is not entitled to be placed in possession until after the time for redemption has expired. 
                  (h)  Whenever no bids are forthcoming on property sold for taxes after the property has been offered a reasonable time, the marshal may either re-advertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The marshal shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and exposed for sale has been abandoned due to lack of bids. 
                  Sec. 78-6. - Bidding by city at tax sales; disposition of property acquired. 
                  (a)  If, during any sale of property for taxes and after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no one present at the sale bids an amount for the property being sold which is as much as the total of the taxes due (including any priority liens for taxes due the state, county, and school and other special tax districts of the state) plus the marshal's cost due on the sale, then the city manager or his/her designee, may purchase the property for the city. If the city purchases property at a sale, the marshal shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city manager. The marshal shall put the city in possession of the property so sold. 
                  (b)  Property acquired by the city pursuant to a sale for taxes or assessments may be divested or alienated by the city only by public sale of the property to the highest bidder; however, when the city has not parted with title to the property, the city may quitclaim the property to the owner at the time of the tax sale, or to the owner's administrators, executors, heirs, or assigns, upon full payment of the redemption price provided in section 78-9 herein.

The marshal shall pay over to the clerk all amounts due the city for taxes and assessments, interest, penalties, and costs, and shall file a final written return or settlement showing the amounts so paid, together with disposition of any excess proceeds derived from the sale. If there is any excess after paying taxes, costs, and all expenses of a sale, it shall be immediately paid to the person authorized to receive the excess. 
                  (b)  In any event, within 90 days from the date executions are placed in his hands, the marshal finds an execution to be either uncollectible or not collectable in full, he shall so notify the city clerk in writing. It shall be the duty of the clerk to cause cancellation of executions on the general execution docket of the county upon their final payment or collection. 
                  Sec. 78-8. - Garnishment by city; reduction of executions to judgment. 
                  (a)  Whenever the marshal can find no property belonging to a defendant in fi.fa. on which to levy any tax execution in his hands, he shall make an entry to that effect on the execution. The city clerk, in the name of the city, may then petition any court of competent jurisdiction to issue a summons of garnishment against any person whom he or she believes to be indebted to the defendant in fi.fa. or who has property, money, or effects in his hands belonging to the defendant in fi.fa. The clerk shall enter upon the execution the names of the persons garnished and the court and file number of the action where the garnishment is filed. All subsequent proceedings shall be the same as provided by law in other cases where judgments have been obtained or execution issued. 
                  (b)  When an execution for taxes remains unsatisfied and an entry of "nulla bona" has been duly entered by the marshal on the execution within the immediately preceding 30-day period and the city clerk has reason to believe the defendant in fi.fa. may have or may come into ownership or assets outside the state, the clerk, in the name of the city, may petition the superior court of the county in this state in which the defendant in fi.fa. maintains a known residence, place of business, or agent to receive service, to reduce the execution to judgment. If the defendant in fi.fa. does not maintain a known residence in this state, the action may be brought in the county where the tax obligation arose. This and all subsequent proceedings shall be brought in accordance with Chapter 3 of Title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
                  Sec. 78-9. - Redemption rights of defendant in fi.fa.; vesting of title in grantee. 
                  (a)  Whenever real property is sold for taxes or any special assessment, the defendant in fi.fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property may redeem the property from the sale by the payment of the redemption price or the amount required for redemption as fixed by O.C.G.A. § 48-5-42, at any time within 12 months from the date of sale, and at any time after the sale until the right to redeem is foreclosed by the giving of the notice provided for in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-45, which Code sections by reference are incorporated herein as a part of this article. 
                  (b)  Where notice of foreclosure of the right to redeem real property sold at a tax sale has not been given as required in paragraph (a) immediately above, title shall ripen by prescription after a period of four years from the date of recording of the deed in the county where the property is situated, provided the defendant in fi.fa. was not laboring under any legal disability at the time of sale. Unless the tax deed indicates a lesser interest was levied upon and sold, a fee simple title to the property shall vest absolutely in the grantee in the deed or in the grantee's heirs or assigns. In the event the defendant in fi.fa. is laboring under any legal disability, the prescriptive term shall begin from the time the disabilities are removed or abated. 
                  Sec. 78-10. - Costs. 
                  (a)  For issuing executions, the city shall receive only an amount equal to any filing fees charged by the Clerk of Superior Court for recording and cancellation of the tax fi.fa. 
                  (b)  Once a levy is made or posted on the property of a defendant in fi.fa., in addition to all taxes, interest, penalties and costs heretofore accrued, the marshal shall collect a levy administration fee of five percent of the taxes due or $250.00, whichever is the lesser; however, no levy administration fee shall be less than $50.00. 
                  (c)  In addition to the levy administration fee, after levy but prior to the sale, the marshal shall collect his actual costs for advertising the same, postage and service fees actually incurred, and any attorney's fees incurred in examination of title to property, plus a commission for conducting the sale, not to exceed eight percent on sums of $50.00 or less, six percent on sums above $50.00 up to $550.00, and three percent on all sums exceeding $550.00. 
                  (d)  The costs provided in this section shall be cumulative and in addition to any statutory premiums allowed as a part of the redemption price. 
                  Sec. 78-11. - Ad valorem tax. 
                  (a)  The city council shall assess, levy, and collect an ad valorem tax on all real and personal property within the corporate limits of the city that is subject to such taxation by the state and county. 
                  (b)  The city council shall use this revenue to defray the costs of operating the city government, of providing governmental services, for the repayment of principal and interest on general obligations, and for any other public purpose as determined by the city council in its discretion. 
                  (c)  The millage rate for the city property tax shall be 10.999. The city property tax must be paid by December 20, 2018. If the taxpayer fails to pay within 120 days, then the city shall be authorized to collect the penalties and interest set forth in section 78-3 of the Ashburn Code of Ordinances. 
                  (d)  The city property tax shall be paid in one lump sum by the due date specified above; however, the city council authorizes the voluntary payment of city property taxes prior to the time when due.

                  (7)  By reasons of force majeure which term shall mean acts of God, strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances, acts of the public enemy, war, blockades, insurrections, riots, epidemics, landslides, unusual conditions of weather or temperature, lightning, earthquakes, fires, storms, floods, washouts, arrests and restraints of governments and people, civil disturbances, explosions, breakage of or accidents to machinery, lines of pipe, or the City's peak shaving plants, freezing of wells or lines of pipe, partial or complete curtailment of deliveries from the city's supplier as a result of force majeure under the supplier's gas purchase contacts, inability to obtain rights-of-way, franchises, permits, materials, equipment, supplies, or an inability to obtain an unlimited supply of gas from the city's suppliers, and any other causes, whether of the kind herein enumerated or otherwise, not within the control of the city and/or its supplier or the customer and which by the exercise of due diligence either the city and/or its supplier or the customer is unable to prevent or overcome. It is understood and agreed that the settlement of strikes or lockouts shall be entirely within the discretion of the person affected, and the above requirement that any force majeure shall be remedied with all reasonable dispatch shall not require the settlement of strikes or lockouts when such course is inadvisable in the discretion of the person affected thereby.

                  (a)  If the customer believes his or her bill to be in error, he or she shall present this claim, in person, at City Hall before the bill becomes delinquent. The claim, if made after the bill has become delinquent, shall not be effective in preventing discontinuance of service as provided in section 86-6 above. The consumer may pay the bill under protest, and the payment shall not prejudice his or her claim. 
                  (b)  The city will make a special meter reading at the request of a consumer for a fee as fixed from time to time by the city council; provided, however, that if such special reading discloses that the meter was overread, no charge will be made. 
                  (c)  Meters will be tested at the request of the consumer upon payment to the city of the actual costs of making the test; provided, however, that if the meter is found to overregister beyond three percent of the correct volume, no charge will be made. 
                  (d)  If the seal of a meter is broken by other than the city's representative, or if the meter fails to register correctly or is stopped for any cause, the consumer shall pay an amount estimated from the record of his or her previous bills and/or from other proper data. 
                  Sec. 86-8. - Property owners not responsible for unpaid bills. 
                  Whenever there shall be due the city any charges for unpaid utility bills at rental property, it shall not be the owner's responsibility to pay the bill before any service will be given to the location. A lien cannot be issued against the property for unpaid utility bills.

                  (b)  Customer agrees that if a condition exists on a customer's premises, which, in the city's sole opinion, is dangerous to the city's representatives or the city's equipment and/or prevents reasonable access to city's equipment, city may remove or relocate its equipment at the customer's sole expense. 
                  (c)  Customer shall furnish to city, at all times and at no cost to city, a satisfactory and lawful right-of-way through its premises for city's equipment necessary or incidental to the furnishing of service; if required to do so by city, customer shall execute a written right-of-way agreement. The customer may make full use and enjoyment of the lands and premises included within the right-of-way granted by this paragraph in any manner not inconsistent with the use and purposes of said land and premises to city; provided, however, that the customer, its heirs, successors, and assigns, shall not construct nor permit to be constructed any house, structure, or obstruction, nor impound any water nor permit to be impounded any water on or over the right-of-way, and the customer, its heirs, successors, and assigns, further agrees that the customer, and its heirs, successors, and assigns, will not change the grade over the pipeline or pipelines in any manner which will reduce the depth of said pipeline or pipelines. The customer shall also furnish suitable space and satisfactory protection for city's equipment installed on the premises. 
                  (d)  Customer's request for service and acceptance of such service from city shall be deemed to grant to city an implied right-of-way over the premises, if customer has not executed a written right-of-way agreement as requested by city. 
                  (e)  If a customer uses service before the service agreement is effective, such service shall nevertheless be governed by these rules and regulations and the applicable rate schedule(s) from the commencement of such service. City may discontinue such service upon failure or refusal of the customer to agree to the conditions of service and pay in full any amounts due for service to that date. Before terminating service for nonpayment of amounts due for service, city will provide notice to the customer. 
                  Sec. 86-10. - Refusal of service. 
                  City reserves the right to refuse service to any applicant who is found to be indebted to the city for any service previously furnished until satisfactory arrangements have been made for the payment of all such indebtedness. City may also refuse to furnish service to any applicant desiring to establish service for former subscribers of City who are indebted for previous service, regardless of the listing requested for such service, until satisfactory arrangements have been made for the payment of such indebtedness. 
                  Sec. 86-11. - Customer's responsibility to notify city when vacating premises. 
                  The customer will notify the city at least 24 hours before vacating the premises served and will pay upon presentation all bills due for service rendered to the premises. City shall have no liability to customer or to any other person for any damages incurred as a result of the customer vacating the premises such as, but not limited to, frozen water pipes, damaged equipment, damages to any building or structure, or any other damage or injury of any type. 
                  Sec. 86-12. - Non-assignability and transfer. 
                  The customer's rights to service and rights provided under any service agreement with the city are personal and shall not be transferred or assigned by the customer without the written consent of the city, which the city, in its sole discretion, may refuse to grant. In the event that a transfer or assignment is granted, the city may establish a fee to transfer service from one customer to another provided a deposit remains on file with the city.

                  Sec. 86-51. - Application. 
                  (a)  Service will be supplied pursuant to the city's standard service agreement under the applicable rate schedule(s) and the rules and regulations contained herein. Except as provided in the following paragraph, the city shall not be required to supply service unless and until such service agreement has been executed by the customer and the city. 
                  (b)  When no charges for excess facilities are involved, an applicant's application for service and the city's acceptance may be verbal. In such event, the applicable rate schedule(s), the terms of the standard service agreement, and these rules and regulations shall be effective and binding on the city and the customer as of the date the city first provides service to customer. In the absence of an executed service agreement or other written agreement, such a verbal agreement shall be conclusively presumed to exist if gas supplied by the city is used by the customer or on the customer's premises. 
                  Sec. 86-52. - Interruptions of service; action to maintain system integrity; special conditions. 
                  (a)  Interruptions. The city shall make reasonable efforts to avoid interruptions of service. When interruptions occur for any reason, the city shall restore service within the shortest time practical under the conditions. The city shall not be liable, in any manner to the customer or any other person, for any loss or damage resulting from such failure or interruptions of service. 
                  (b)  Action to maintain system integrity. When the city, in its sole discretion, determines that it is necessary to curtail or interrupt service to maintain the integrity of its system or to provide for its or the public's safety, the city shall have the right to curtail or interrupt delivery of gas to any customer. 
                  (c)  Emergency uses. It is expressly understood and agreed that the city does not furnish uninterruptible service for pumping water, emergency power generation, or any other emergency use. In the event a customer uses gas for emergency uses, the customer, at all times, shall maintain a standby supply of energy so that it will not be necessary to rely on gas during a time of emergency. The city shall not be liable, in any event, to any customer, any inhabitants of any municipal customer, or any other person, for any loss or injury of or to property or persons occasioned by, or resulting directly or indirectly from, the failure of any fire protection or other emergency apparatus to operate, whether said failure shall be due to the act or omission of the city or otherwise. 
                  (d)  Special conditions. The following conditions are applicable to large interruptible commercial and industrial service. Any large interruptible commercial and industrial service customer agrees to have and to maintain complete standby fuel and equipment available and agrees to use it whenever necessary. The city shall not be liable, in any manner to the customer or any other person, for any failure, in whole or in part, temporary or permanent, to deliver gas under any of the foregoing services. 
                  Sec. 86-53. - Pressure. 
                  The City will generally supply natural gas at a pressure of approximately 0.25 pounds per square inch gauge ("psig"). The city and the customer, however, may mutually agree upon a higher pressure at which gas shall be delivered. In no event shall the city be required to furnish gas to the customer at a pressure exceeding two psig for residential service, or five psig for all other classes of service, except to the extent that the city has agreed to do so by written agreement. 
                  Sec. 86-54. - Relocation of city meters and equipment. 
                  The city may change the location of facilities and rights-of-way upon customer's request, but the customer must bear the expense of the change; provided, however, no change will be made where it will interfere with or jeopardize city's service, either to the customer requesting the change or to any other customer(s). All privileges of the city incident to the original location shall apply to the new location. When a meter is relocated at the city's option, all expense in connection with such change shall be borne by the city. If the relocation is made at the customer's request, all expense will be borne by the customer. 
                  Sec. 86-55. - Possession of gas. 
                  The customer agrees that the city is responsible only for the gas service to the delivery point to the customer, and the city shall not be liable to customer or any of customer's agents, servants, or employees, or to any person whomever, for any loss, damage, of injury to any person or property resulting from the said gas or its use after it leaves said delivery point. Customer agrees that customer shall assume all such risks downstream of the point of delivery, except when caused by the exclusive negligence or willful acts of the employees of the city. 
                  Furthermore, the city shall not be responsible for the transmission, use, or contrzol of gas beyond the delivery point. The city shall not be liable for any loss, damage, or injury to person or property whatsoever, accruing or resulting in any manner, from the receipt, use, or discontinuance of the use of the gas beyond the delivery point, defective customer equipment, or any cause not resulting from the direct, exclusive negligence or willful acts of the city. 
                  Sec. 86-56. - Reports of leaks. 
                  Customer shall give immediate notice to the city when any leakage of gas is discovered. Customer agrees not to use any light of any character, or other igniting medium, in the proximity of escaping gas, or to do, or suffer to be done, any act which would ignite such gas, and to shut off the flow of gas immediately. The city shall not be liable for any leakage of gas, or any damage or loss arising out of, or caused by, any leakage of gas, except when due to the exclusive negligence or willful acts of the employees of the city. 
                  Sec. 86-57. - Extension of service. 
                  (a)  The city will extend mains in streets that are at an established final grade for distances up to 100 feet without charge to the customer. If a main extension exceeds 100 feet, the city will perform a feasibility test and may require a CIAC to reimburse the city for the cost of any main extension in excess of 100 feet and any other excess facilities necessary to extend service in the event the anticipated revenue does not produce a reasonable return on the total cost of such excess facilities. 
                  (b)  The city will install up to 100 feet of gas service line (measured from the premises's property line to the meter on the customer's premises) at no charge. For installations requiring more than 100 feet of gas service line, the city may require the customer to pay a CIAC. 
                  (c)  Notwithstanding the above, if facilities in addition to a simple main extension and service line are required, the city will perform a feasibility test to determine whether or not these facilities will require the customer to pay a CIAC. 
                  (d)  A CIAC may be required for facilities located at a point other than that selected by the city or deviating from the route selected by the city. 
                  At any time a feasibility test is required, the city shall also calculate the estimated cost of (1) the main in excess of the 100 feet of main for which no CIAC is required and (2) the service line in excess of the 100 feet of service line for which no CIAC is required for new customers occupying existing structures. (For proposed new subdivisions, the allowances for extensions of mains and service lines should be considered only for existing structures that plan to use gas at the time the main is to be extended.) Any CIAC shall be the lesser of (1) the CIAC calculated in the feasibility test or (2) the full cost of extending the lines beyond the initial allowances of 100 feet of main and service line. The aforementioned feasibility test shall include all costs directly associated with the service extension. The city may waive this requirement at its discretion on a case by case basis. 
                  [(e)]  Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b), and (g) of this section, the city will perform a feasibility test to determine whether or not these additional facilities will require the customer to pay a CIAC. 
                  [(f)]  A CIAC may be required for facilities located at a point other than that selected by the city or deviating from the route selected by the city. 
                  [(g)]  At any time a feasibility test is required, the city shall also calculate the estimated cost of (1) the main in excess of the 100 feet of main for which no CIAC is required and (2) the service line in excess of the 100 feet of service line for which no CIAC is required for new customers occupying existing structures. (For proposed new subdivision, the allowances for extensions of mains and service lines should be considered only for existing structures that plan to use gas at the time the main is to be extended.) Any CIAC shall be the lesser of (1) the CIAC calculated in the feasibility test or (2) the full cost of extending the lines beyond the initial allowances of 100 feet of main and service line. The aforementioned feasibility test shall include all costs directly associated with the service extension. The city may waive this requirement at its discretion on a case by case basis. 
                  [(h)]  Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b), and (g) of this section, the city will perform a feasibility test to determine whether a CIAC is required for all extensions of service when the customer's request for service does not include the use of gas for either central space heating or water heating. 
                  Sec. 86-58. - Farm tap service. 
                  (a)  Whenever an applicant requests service which can only be supplied from a high pressure (above 60 pounds per square inch gauge) main, the city, subject to the results of a feasibility test, may tap the main, install regulating equipment, and extend its facilities to the delivery point on the customer's premises. The customer will provide the city with all necessary rights-of-way on its premises at no expense to the city. Whether a CIAC is required of the customer prior to the installation of such facilities will be determined by the results of the feasibility test. 
                  (b)  For a farm tap customer, a feasibility test shall be performed which includes all costs less an allowance for the cost of (i) the actual feet of main required to serve the customer, not to exceed 100 feet, (ii) the actual feet of service required to serve the customer, not to exceed 100 feet, and (iii) the actual number of meter set(s). 
                  (c)  Charges for service will be billed on the applicable city rate schedule. All other terms and conditions of the applicable city rate schedule(s) apply to customers using farm tap service. 
                  (d)  Any customer receiving service as the result of the installation of a farm tap customer shall furnish to the city, at all times and at no cost to the city, a satisfactory and lawful right-of-way through its premises for the city's equipment necessary or incidental to the furnishing of service and shall execute a written right-of-way agreement. The customer may make full use and enjoyment of the lands and premises included within the right-of-way granted by this paragraph in any manner not inconsistent with the use and purposes of said land and premises by the city; provided, however, that the customer, its heirs, successors, and assigns, shall not construct nor permit to be constructed any house, structure, or obstruction; nor impound nor permit to be impounded any water on or over the right-of-way; and the customer, its heirs, successors, and assigns, further agree that the customer and its heirs, successors, and assigns will not change the grade over the pipeline or pipelines in any manner which will reduce the depth of said pipeline or pipelines. 
                  Sec. 86-59. - Customer's equipment. 
                  (a)  An applicant or customer shall give the city notice prior to installing any customer equipment (including any equipment which may increase the customer's load) on the premises to enable the city to ascertain the feasibility of providing service to such equipment. The city shall provide information concerning the availability of service (including whether the city can service the increased load), delivery pressure, meter location, and other information which may be pertinent to the installation. 
                  (b)  The customer's equipment must be installed and maintained in accordance with approved installation standards and the requirements of applicable local, state, and federal agencies. All customer equipment shall be maintained by and be the sole responsibility of the customer and/or owner of the premises. 
                  (c)  If the customer's equipment might create a vacuum, back pressure, or any other condition which in the city's sole opinion could cause operating difficulties on the city's system, a device meeting city's specifications must be installed and maintained by the customer, at its sole expense, to protect fully and completely the city's system. 
                  Sec. 86-60. - Requests to increase load. 
                  Residential customers receiving service will be permitted to increase their residential gas loads at the same premises without the consent of the city. All other customers shall make a request to the city before increasing their gas loads and before changing the purpose for which they use gas. The request will be in writing and will specify, at a minimum, the name of the customer, type of service needed, estimated monthly gas consumption, and the date needed. If, in the city's sole opinion, it has the capability to provide the additional or changed gas service without interfering with its ability to provide service to its other customers, the city will permit the customer to increase customer's load or to change the purpose for which the customer uses gas. A CIAC may be required depending on the nature of the request. 
                  Sec. 86-61. - Excavation near the city's facilities. 
                  The customer shall inform the city of any excavation activities near the city's equipment located on the customer's premises by calling the city manager at least 48 hours in advance of such activities. The customer will give a similar notice to the city prior to any additions or changes in customer's premises which will extend over, under, or near the city's equipment. Any damages incurred or losses of gas resulting from any such activity shall be billed to the customer. 
                  Sec. 86-62. - Prohibition against resale of gas. 
                  The customer shall not directly or indirectly sell, resell, assign, or otherwise transfer gas to any person unless such transfer is pursuant to a contract or franchise acceptable to the city. 
                  Sec. 86-63. - Unavoidable cessation of consumption. 
                  In the event the customer's premises are destroyed or the operation of its facilities is shut down due to causes beyond the customer's control resulting in a complete cessation of the use of service, then upon written notice to the city advising that the customer has ceased operations for the reasons set forth above, which reasons for the complete cessation of the use of service shall be specifically described, and intends to resume service as soon as possible, any customer charge, minimum charge, or guarantee for which the customer may be held liable may be waived, in the sole discretion of the city, during the period of such cessation. To be effective, such notice must be received by the city within ten days of the occurrence of the cessation.

In the event that a district boundary line on the zoning map divides a lot of record held in one ownership on the date of passage of this ordinance, each part of the lot so divided shall be used in conformity with the regulations established by this ordinance for the district in which such parcel is located; except, however, that if the property owner of such a lot so desires, he may extend a use allowed on either portion of said lot 50 feet beyond the district boundary line in accordance with setbacks and yard requirements of the district into which he is encroaching. 
                  3-16. Height Limitations of Walls and Fences. Within any residential district, no wall or fence shall exceed eight feet in height within or along a boundary of a rear or side yard. Within the front yard, all fences or walls shall have a height limit of four feet. 
                  3-17. Required Buffers in NC, G-C, D-C, WLI, and HI Districts. In an NC, GC, DC, WLI, and HI zoning district, where a lot abuts any residential district, a six-foot-wide buffer the entire length of the lot abutting the residential property shall be provided with screening as specified in section 3-19. Off-street parking associated with such uses shall be governed by this same provision. 
                  3-18. Screening of Service Areas Within 150 Feet of Public Street. Any service area, loading area, refuse, or storage area between a principal building and a public street being visible from said street and lying within 150 feet of said street shall be screened from view from the public street as specified in section 3-19. 
                  3-19. Screening Required. Wherever screening is required by this ordinance, a durable masonry wall, or fence and hedge of sufficient opacity to provide a visual blind, designed to be compatible with the character of adjoining properties, shall be provided. Such fences and walls shall be at least six feet in height, but no greater than eight feet in height, measured from the ground along the common lot line of the adjoining properties. Hedges or comparable natural plantings shall be of such variety that an average height of at least six feet could be expected by normal growth within no later than three years from the time of planting. At the time of application for building permit, the applicant shall post a performance bond sufficient to cover the installation of the required screening. If installed within one year from the date of application for the building permit, the bond shall be returned. However, if the required screening is not completed within the required time period, the bond is forfeited and the required screening shall be installed by the city. In lieu of posting a performance bond to cover screening costs, the owner/developer may install the screening prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy. Under this option, occupancy will not be allowed until the screening is completed as a part of the normal development plan. 
                  3-20. Side and Rear Yards Not Required Next to Railroad. Within any nonresidential district, side yards and rear yards shall not be required adjacent to railroad rights-of-way.

                  3-22. Permitted Modification of Setback Requirement. When a building is proposed on a lot and when on either or both lots which adjoin such lot at the street right-of-way line there exists a principal building which does not conform to the setback requirements of this ordinance, the required setback for such building shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  Where only one said adjoining lot contains a principal building with a nonconforming setback the setback shall be the computed average of: 
                  (a)  The normal setback requirement with; 
                  (b)  The nonconforming setback; or 
                  (2)  Where both adjoining lots contain a principal building each with a nonconforming setback, the minimum setback shall be the computed average of the two nonconforming setbacks. 
                  3-23. Structures Permitted Above the Height Limit. The height limits of these regulations shall not apply to a church spire, belfry, cupola, dome, or ornamental tower not intended for human occupancy, monument, water tower, observation tower, transmission tower, chimney, smoke stack, conveyor, flag pole, radio or television tower, mast or aerial, parapet wall not extending more than four feet above the roof line of the building, and necessary mechanical appurtenances.

Architectural features such as cornices, eaves, steps, gutters and fire escapes may project not more than three feet beyond any required setback line, except where such projections would obstruct driveways which are or may be used for access for service and/or emergency vehicles; provided, however, that in the case of automobile service stations, motels and similar uses which serve the motoring public, canopies shall be allowed over a driveway or walkways within the front yard not to extend from the principal building to a point any closer than 15 feet from the street right-of-way line. 
                  3-25. Modification of Side Yard Requirements. When a lot of record has a width less than the frontage required in the district in which it is located, then the zoning administrator shall be authorized to reduce the side yard requirements for such lot; provided, however, that there shall not be less than an eight-foot side yard. 
                  3-26. Historic District Regulation Compliance. Pursuant to Georgia law, the City of Ashburn has adopted certain design development regulations to protect specific historic resources in the city. In addition to general zoning standards, all requirements of the City of Ashburn Historic District Ordinance, as amended, shall be complied with as a part of the normal permitting process.

Each day of continued violation shall be considered a separate offense. 
                  11-6. Remedies.

                  c.  The proposed use will not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend or use such facility, vehicular movement, noise or fumes generation, or type of physical activity. 
                  d.  The proposed use will not be affected adversely by the existing uses of adjacent properties; and the proposed use will be placed on a lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of said use. 
                  e.  The parking and all development standards set forth for each particular use for which a permit may be granted will be met.

                  12-6.2B. Conditions of special exception. Special exceptions approved by the board may be terminated upon notice and action by the board at any time subsequent to the approval thereof by the board in the event that the owner of the property subject thereto fails to satisfy and maintain the existence of any of the following, conditions subsequent: 
                  a.  Execute or establish use of the special exception use approved by the board within 12 months from the date of approval thereof by the board or within such other term as the board shall specifically designate therefor in which case the applicant must execute or establish such use within the term so designated by the board; 
                  b.  Maintain the special exception use of the property subject thereto in accordance with the approved special exception continuously following establishment of the special exception use without interruption exceeding one year in duration; 
                  c.  Maintain continuous compliance with any and all restrictions, standards or requirements which may be imposed by the board in connection with the approval of such special exception; or

                  12-6.3. Request for a variance. The board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of these regulations as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Provided, however, that a variance shall not be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this resolution in the district in question. Such variance may be granted in an individual case upon finding by the board that all of the following exist: 
                  a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography; and 
                  b.  The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; and 
                  c.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and 
                  d.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of these regulations; provided that no variance may be granted by a use of land, building or structure that is prohibited by this ordinance. Applications for use variances shall not be accepted by the zoning administrator. Such requests shall be properly filed as requests for rezoning, the authority for such rezoning of property being solely reserved for the Ashburn City Council. 
                  e.  Provided that the board of appeals may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards (i.e., increased setbacks, buffer strips, screening, etc.) as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of residents and workers in the community, and to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood. Provided, that whenever the board of appeals shall find, in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations that any of the terms, conditions or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not being complied with, said board shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing. 
                  12-6.4. Request for extension of nonconforming residential uses. The board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases an extension or replacement of an existing nonconforming residential use which the board is specifically authorized to pass on under the terms of this resolution. Said extension may be granted in an individual case upon finding by the board that: 
                  a.  The use is a nonconforming use as defined in these regulations; and 
                  b.  The use is in full compliance with all requirements of these regulations applicable to nonconforming uses; and 
                  c.  The extension of said use will not further injure a permitted use on adjacent property in the same district. 
                  d.  This section is specifically designed to allow for the replacement of homeowner occupied residential units in areas no longer zoned for residential uses. As such, this provision is not subject to the limits of section 8-5. 
                  12-7. Forms. Appeals from actions of the zoning administrator, requests for permission to establish a use requiring special exception approval, requests for variances, and requests for extension of a nonconforming residential use shall be made on forms provided for such purposes. All information required on said forms shall be provided by the applicant. Forms shall be filed with the zoning administrator, and the applicant shall pay the City of Ashburn for expenses incidental to the appeal. No form shall be accepted by the zoning administrator unless it contains all pertinent information and is accompanied by the required fee of $100.00 to defray expenses.

The mayor, or his designee, shall officially declare the public hearing open and shall note that the City of Ashburn's written Public Hearing Procedures, City of Ashburn's Standards for Exercise of Zoning Powers, and a copy of Georgia's Conflict of Interest Law are available to the attending public as a handout and are posted for public review. 
                  The zoning administrator and/or designee shall then announce the matter for consideration. The mayor shall then call for acknowledgement of a potential conflict of interest by members of the council. The zoning administrator will then report the staff recommendation and the recommendation of the Ashburn Planning Commission. The mayor shall then allow public input. General procedures to be followed will require citizen comments to be heard in an orderly fashion. Citizens speaking in favor of the request shall be heard first, followed by those opposed to the issue. All speakers will be asked to provide his or her name and address for the public record. Citizens are requested to keep their comments as brief as possible so that all who wish to be heard will have adequate time. Where there is a large number of citizens wishing to testify at a given hearing, the presiding officer may invoke reasonable time limitations on both the proponents and opponents of a request. In such cases, these time limits shall apply to both sides of an issue equally. Citizens shall address their comments to the city council as a whole. Individual attacks or cross examination of council members, city employees or other citizens will be ruled out of order. The city council retains the privilege to ask any questions of staff or any citizen present for clarification. 
                  After all citizen comments have been received, all further discussion of the specific application is reserved for the city council.

                  8.  Whether the proposed change will be detrimental to the value, improvement, or development of adjacent or nearby property in accordance with existing regulations; 
                  9.  Whether the proposed change is out of scale with the needs of the neighborhood or the City of Ashburn; 
                  10.  Whether the proposed change will constitute a grant of special privilege to the individual owner as contrasted with the adjacent or nearby neighborhood or with the general public; and 
                  11.  The extent to which the zoning decision is consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan, as amended. 
                  e.  Public hearings records standards. The city clerk shall mechanically record the proceedings of all zoning public hearings.
