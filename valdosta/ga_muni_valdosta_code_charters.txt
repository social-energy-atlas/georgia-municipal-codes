THE CODE OF THE CITY OF VALDOSTA, GEORGIA ____________ Published in 2007 by Order of the Mayor and Council ____________ OFFICIALS of the CITY OF VALDOSTA, GEORGIA AT THE TIME OF THIS RECODIFICATION ____________ John J. Fretti Mayor ____________ John Eunice Willie T. Head, Jr. Alvin Payton, Jr. David J. Sumner Joseph "Sonny" Vickers James Wright Robert Yost City Council ____________ Larry H. Hanson City Manager ____________ George T. Talley City Attorney ____________ Teresa S. Bolden City Clerk PREFACE     This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Valdosta, Georgia.     Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1976 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1976 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.     The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. Chapter and Section Numbering System     The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. Page Numbering System     The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: CHARTERCHT:1RELATED LAWSRL:1CHARTER AND RELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLECHTCT:1CODECD1:1CODE APPENDIXCDA:1CODE COMPARATIVE TABLESCCT:1STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLESLT:1CHARTER AND RELATED LAWS INDEXCHTi:1CODE INDEXCDi:1 Indexes     The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. Looseleaf Supplements     A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.     Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. Acknowledgments     This publication was under the direct supervision of Ron McLaughlin, Code Attorney, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.     The publisher is most grateful to Larry Hanson, City Manager, George Talley, City Attorney, Richard Hamlen, Finance Director, and Jeanette Marchiafava, Clerk of Council, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs. Copyright     All editorial enhancements of this Code are copyrighted by Municipal Code Corporation and the City of Valdosta, Georgia.

Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other times as the board may determine. The chairman, or in his absence the acting chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. The board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the board and shall be a public record.     Appeals to the board of appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the municipality or county affected by any decision of the administrative officer. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the board, by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the board of appeals a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.     An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the board of appeals after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in a certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril of life and property. In such case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board of appeals or by a competent court on application, on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and on due cause shown.     The board of appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal or other matter referred to it, and give public notice, thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.     The board of appeals shall have the following powers: (1)	To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of any ordinance adopted pursuant to this act. (2)	To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of the ordinance upon which such board is required to pass under such ordinance. (3)	To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of the ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the board of appeals that: a.	There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography, and b.	The application of the ordinance to this particular piece of property would create practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, and c.	Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved, andd.	Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of the ordinance; provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by the ordinance.     In exercising the above powers, the board of appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of this act, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit. 
Section 12. - Zoning: Enforcement and remedies.     The city council or county commission may provide for the enforcement of any ordinance enacted under this act by means of the withholding of building permits and occupancy permits, and for such purpose may establish and fill the position of building inspector, individually or jointly. From and after the establishment of such position and the filling of the same, it shall be unlawful to construct, reconstruct, or alter any building or other structure without first obtaining a building permit from such building inspector or to use such building or structure or any land without first obtaining an occupancy permit from such building inspector; and such building inspector shall not issue any permit unless the requirements of this act and of any ordinance adopted pursuant to it are complied with. A violation of any ordinance enacted under this act occurring within the corporate limits of the City of Valdosta shall be punished as provided by city ordinance. In case any building or structure is or is proposed to be erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, converted, or maintained, or any building, structure or land is or is proposed to be used in violation of any ordinance enacted under this act, the building inspector, city or county attorney, or other appropriate authority of the municipality or county or any adjacent or neighboring property owner who would be specially damaged by such violation may, in addition to other remedies, institute injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance, or use, or to correct or abate such violation, or to prevent the occupancy of said building, structure, or land. 
Section 13. - Zoning: Conflict with other laws.     Whenever the regulations made under authority of this act require a greater width or size of yards, courts, or require a lower height of buildings or smaller number of stories, or require a greater percentage of lot to be left unoccupied, or impose other more restrictive standards than are required in or under any other statute, the regulations made under authority of this act shall govern. Whenever the provisions of any other statute require more restrictive standards than are required by the regulations made under authority of this act, the provisions of such statute shall govern. 
Section 14. - Subdivision regulation: Provision of regulations.     In exercising the powers granted to it by this act, the planning commission shall prepare and recommend to the city council or to the county commission for adoption regulations governing the subdivision of land within the municipality and unincorporated portion of the county respectively.

Such regulations may provide that, in lieu of the completion of such work and installations previous to the final approval of a plat, the city council or county commission may accept a bond, in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to it providing for and securing to the municipality or county the actual construction and installation of such improvements and utilities within a period specified by the planning commission and expressed in the bonds; and the municipality or county is hereby granted the power to enforce such bonds by all appropriate legal and equitable remedies. The city council and the county commission are hereby given the power to adopt and amend such land subdivision regulations after a public hearing thereon, at least 30 days' notice of the time and place of which shall have been published once a week for four consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality or county. 
Section 15. - Subdivision regulation: Procedure on plats.     The planning commission is hereby given the power to give tentative approval or disapproval to preliminary plats, and to approve or disapprove final plats, but in each case their action shall be taken within thirty days after the submission thereof; otherwise, such plat shall be deemed to have been approved and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the planning commission on demand; provided, however, that the applicant for the planning commission's approval may waive this requirement and consent to the extension of such period. The ground of disapproval of any plat shall be stated upon the records of the planning commission. Any plat submitted to the planning commission shall contain the name and address of a person to whom notice of hearing may be sent; and no plat shall be acted upon by the planning commission without affording a hearing thereon, notice of the time and place of which shall be sent by mail to said address not less than five days before the date fixed therefor. 
Section 16. - Subdivision regulation: Effect of plat approval on status of dedications.     The approval of a plat by the planning commission shall not be deemed to constitute or effect an acceptance by the municipality or county or public of the dedication of any street or other ground shown upon the plat. 
Section 17. - Subdivision regulation: Erection of buildings.     From and after the time when the platting jurisdiction of the planning commission shall have attached by virtue of adoption by the planning commission of a major street plan and the adoption by the city council and the county commission of a set of land subdivision regulations recommended to them by the planning commission, no building permit shall be issued for and no building shall be erected on any lot within the municipality or county unless the street giving access to the lot upon which said building is proposed to be placed shall be accepted or opened as, or shall have otherwise received the legal status of a public street prior to that time, or unless such street corresponds in its location and lines with a street shown on a subdivision plat approved by said planning commission or on a street plat made and adopted by said planning commission or with a street located and accepted by the city council or county commission.

Section 5. - Administration and appointment of board members.     Each district created pursuant to this act shall be administered by a six-member board appointed by the mayor and council of the City of Valdosta.

IX, § V, or any other provision of law prohibiting or restricting the borrowing of money or the creation of debt by political subdivisions of the State of Georgia, which debt shall be backed by the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the district but shall not be an obligation of the State of Georgia, the City of Valdosta, or any other unit of government of the State of Georgia other than the district. 
Section 9. - Cooperation with local governments.     The services and facilities provided pursuant to this act shall be provided for in a cooperation agreement executed jointly by the board and the mayor and council of the City of Valdosta. If the parties to the cooperation agreement so agree, the cooperation agreement may provide that such private persons as are designated by the district perform the actual construction or improvement of the services and facilities provided by the district. The provisions of this section shall in no way limit the authority of the City of Valdosta to provide services or facilities within the district; and the City of Valdosta shall retain full and complete authority and control over any of its facilities located within its respective areas of any district.

The terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions contained in or provided or permitted by any resolution of the board authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bind the board members of the district then in office and their successors. (d)	The board shall have power from time to time and whenever it deems it expedient to refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether or not the bonds to be refunded have matured, and may issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any other purpose permitted under this act.

Section 12. - Authorized contents of agreements and instruments of the board generally; use of proceeds of sale of bonds, notes, and other obligations. (a)	Subject to the limitations and procedures provided by this section and by the immediately preceding section, the agreements or instruments executed by a board may contain such provisions not inconsistent with law as shall be determined by such board. (b)	The proceeds derived from the sale of all bonds, notes, and other obligations issued by a district shall be held and used for the ultimate purpose of paying, directly or indirectly as permitted in this act, all or part of the cost of any project or for the purpose of refunding any bonds, notes, or other obligations issued in accordance with this act. (c)	Issuance by a board of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one or more purposes shall not preclude such board from issuing other bonds, notes, or obligations in connection with the same project or with any other projects; but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations are issued shall recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds, notes, or other obligations, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the board to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations on a parity with such prior issue. 
Section 13. - Construction; applicability of O.C.G.A. § 10-5-1 et seq., the "Georgia Securities Act of 1973"; notice, proceeding, publication, referendum.     This act shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes hereof. The offer, sale, or issuance of bonds, notes, or other obligations by a district shall not be subject to regulation under O.C.G.A. § 10-5-1 et seq., the "Georgia Securities Act of 1973."
