         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Bainbridge, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1992 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1992 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments

                  (b)	Such meetings shall be open to the public to the extent required by law and notice to the public of emergency meetings shall be made as fully as is reasonably possible in accordance with Code Section 50-14-1 of the O.C.G.A. or such other applicable laws as are or may hereafter be enacted.

                  (Ord. No. 600, 9-18-2007)
                  Sec. 2-173. - Purchases and expenditures, procedure. 
                  (a)	Nonbudgeted purchases: 
                  (1)	The city council fully understands and identifies that every event cannot be foreseen, but the city council also understands that the budget is the basis for the city's financial actions for each respective fiscal year. As such, nonbudgeted purchases must be kept at a bare minimum, and need to undergo the closest scrutiny to determine how necessary each nonbudgeted purchase may be. 
                  (2)	When a division head determines the necessity to purchase a nonbudgeted operating or capital item he/she must justify this need to the city. 
                  (3)	The city manager shall notify mayor and council of any nonbudgeted capital purchases he has authorized in excess of $3,000.00 at a regular meeting and shall obtain formal ratification of said action from mayor and council. 
                  (b)	Budgeted purchases: 
                  (1)	The city hereby establishes a centralized purchasing system where all city purchases will be coordinated by the city manager's office subject to the regulations outlined herein. 
                  (2)	The city manager shall be responsible for implementing and enforcing all purchasing rules and regulations and will maintain and distribute to all eligible vendors purchasing rules and regulations as may be written specifically for those vendors. 
                  (3)	The city manager shall establish internal procedures for review of all proposed expenditures to be known as the encumbrance process. The encumbrance process shall have the effect of reserving city funds to cover authorized purchases made within approved appropriations levels based on a modified accrual basis of accounting. 
                  (c)	The encumbrance process: 
                  (1)	It shall be the policy of the city that all purchasing be done in a competitive environment with qualified vendors being given a reasonable opportunity to do business with the city. 
                  (2)	In order to initiate a purchase, an employee must complete the city requisition form, sign it and forward it to their division head for approval. The completed requisition form must have the cost of each product or item noted on the form. If approved, the division head or designee shall sign the requisition form, identify and indicate the accounting code (budgeted line item) for this expense and forward it to the city manager's office for processing. If the actual cost of the purchase is lower than that indicated, the correction will be made to the original purchase order by the finance division. Purchases over $1,000.00 shall require the specific approval of the city manager. 
                  (3)	A purchase order shall be initiated; thus encumbering the specific line item appropriation to be charged with the transaction. In the event there are insufficient funds left within the cited accounting code (budgeted line item), the purchase order shall not be issued and the requisition form shall be returned to the respective division head. 
                  (d)	Purchase orders: 
                  (1)	All purchases require division head or designee approval.
                  (2)	Budgeted purchases of less than $150.00 shall not require a purchase order. However, such purchases shall be documented with proper evidence (ticket, invoice, receipt) and with specific approval of the purchase by the applicable division head. Said approval will also reflect assignment of the purchase to the appropriate divisional budget line item number. Purchases made under this category are to be made on a competitive basis unless the city has an established purchasing contract (blanket purchase order) with the applicable vendor. 
                  (3)	All budgeted purchases over $150.00 shall be accompanied by a purchase order. The purchase order must include a P.0. number, the name of the vendor, the name or a description of the item or service being purchased, and the actual or estimated cost of the item or service. Purchase orders for purchases less than $1,000.00 shall be made as field purchase orders within the division. (A field purchase order is one that is issued by an operating division and does not require executive review and approval.) Copies of field purchase orders must be forwarded to the finance division promptly after issuance for encumbrance purposes. Purchase orders over $1,000.00 shall be obtained from the purchasing department and approved by the city manager's office after the purchase has been approved in the process described above 
                  (4)	The general administration division shall reject payment of any purchase over $150.00 that does not include an authorized purchase order; that exceeds budgetary limitations, or is not authorized by the budget. Exceptions to this rule are routine purchases such as city's utility payments, professional services rendered, etc. 
                  (5)	Bonafide emergencies as set forth in wording under subsection (f)(1) shall be an exception to the encumbrance process. 
                  (e)	Criteria for purchases and bids. 
                  (1)	The following requirements for purchases and bidding shall be in effect.
                  a.	Purchases less than $1,000.00. Any purchase of less than $1,000.00 shall be authorized by the respective division head. For any purchase in excess of $150.00 where a blanket purchase order was not in effect the division head must provide written documentation of their efforts to obtain at least three verbal or written quotes or bids for each purchase. Documentation of competitive pricing based on common specifications will be attached to the requisition and all associated paperwork, including the invoice. 
                  b.	Purchases between $1,000.00 and $25,000.00. The division head, together with the city manager, shall authorize purchases between $1,000.00 and $25,000.00. All purchases of less than $5,000.00 shall require informal (nonadvertised, nonsealed) bids. These may be verbal or facsimile as long as written documentation of the competitive pricing and bidding process is attached to the purchase order requisition and other associated paperwork, including standard specifications or requirements, if applicable. A minimum of three bids must be obtained from qualified vendors who regularly offer or carry the items or services to be purchased. All purchases greater than $5,000.00 but less than $10,000.00 shall require a formal bidding process to at a minimum include advertisement for a minimum of one week on the city website and the solicitation of local bids from qualified bidders. All purchases greater than $10,000.00 but less than $25,000.00 shall require formal sealed bids and must at minimum include advertisement on the city's website for two weeks and in the county organ (presently, The Post-Searchlight) at least one time no less than one week prior to the date and the time of public bid opening. 
                  c.	Purchases over $25,000.00. Any purchase in excess of $25,000.00 shall be approved/awarded by the mayor and city council in a regular or special meeting, unless it is made under a City of Bainbridge, state or federal G.S.A. negotiated contract purchasing system. Such purchases shall require formal competitive sealed bids, advertised in the county organ (presently, The Post-Searchlight) at least one time no less than one week prior to the date and the time of public bid opening, in accordance with state law. In addition, the city shall advertise the purchasing opportunity on the city website for a minimum of 21 days and make other reasonable efforts to make qualified vendors aware of the purchasing opportunity, including direct notification of potential vendors in the Bainbridge area. Purchases in this category must be based on standard specifications that allow maximum competition among qualified vendors whose products or services meet established performance requirements. 
                  (2)	It is the policy of the city that any purchase that binds the city by contract shall be approved/awarded by the mayor and council in a regular or special called meeting, irrespective of the value or the amount of the contract. 
                  (3)	Additionally, no item shall be determined a sole source purchase without the approval of the city manager. In this case, there must be full documentation of the lack of a competitive market submitted to the city manager and/or mayor and city council, as applicable. 
                  (4)	It is the policy of the city that the above purchasing limitations and authority guidelines be followed in all circumstances. Under no circumstances should purchases be split or divided to avoid established bid limits. 
                  (5)	Upon not receiving any sealed bids following two lawfully advertised bids, and following approval by the mayor and council, the city manager shall be authorized without additional advertisement to seek and obtain sealed competitive bids from at least three vendors who commonly deal in such supplies, materials, equipment or vehicles. No purchase in excess of $25,000.00 shall be authorized to be purchased in this method. Further, this policy shall not be applicable to public works projects, as defined by O.C.G.A. § 36-91-1 et seq. 
                  (6)	It is the policy of the city that all purchases in excess of $3,000.00 shall be reported to the city council during a regularly scheduled meeting of the city council. 
                  (f)	Emergency purchases. 
                  (1)	A bonafide emergency is a situation, which arises where it would seriously jeopardize the safety, health and welfare of the divisional mission or where it would otherwise adversely affect the work of the division to utilize normal purchases channels. The division head and/or city manager will determine the existence of an emergency situation or condition. Division heads will not use the emergency purchase procedure to abuse or otherwise purposely circumvent the established purchasing procedures. 
                  (2)	Procedure. Purchase of goods, supplies and materials is consummated and receipt obtained. A confirmation letter from the division head explaining the nature of the emergency is prepared, with receipt and or other necessary paperwork attached and forwarded to the city manager the next working day. The city manager shall report the emergency purchases to the mayor and members of the city council no later than the next regularly scheduled meeting.

                  ARTICLE II. - GROUNDWATER PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 26-19. - Short title, background and purpose. 
                  (a)	Background. Variable levels of recharge area protection can be based upon the state's hydrogeology (e.g., areas such as the Dougherty Plan where a major aquifer crops out would receive a relatively high degree of protection whereas other areas, such as the shale hills of northwest Georgia, would receive a lower degree of protection). Recharge area protection within the significant recharge areas would be further refined, based upon the local susceptibility or vulnerability to human induced pollution (e.g., high, medium, or low). The significant recharge areas have already been identified and mapped (about 22 to 23 percent of the state). Pollution susceptibility mapping is ongoing. Existing statutes are adequate for protecting the remaining recharge areas (about 77 to 78 percent of the state). 
                  (b)	Purpose. The purpose of this division is to ensure the protection of the community's groundwater supply. 
                  (Code 1992, § 19-171; Ord. No. 549, § 1, 2-3-1998)
                  Sec. 26-20. - Definitions. 
                  When used in this article, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning given in this section: 
                  Aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
                  Drastic means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U. S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600/2-87-035. (Note: The "drastic" methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility). 
                  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharge, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. 
                  Pollution susceptibility maps means maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the Department of Natural Resources. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas having high, medium and low ground-water pollution potential. 
                  Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
                  Significant recharge areas means those areas mapped by the department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contracts, geologic structure, the presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces. Significant recharge areas for the city are typified by those of the coastal plain. In the coastal plain, the significant recharge areas are the surface outcroppings of the large and extensively used drinking water aquifers (e.g., the Floridan, the Clayton, etc.) and soils having high permeability according to the 1976 1:750,000 Soils Association Map of Georgia.

                  Sec. 26-21. - Criteria. 
                  The following criteria pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 shall apply in significant recharge areas: 
                  (1)	The department of natural resources shall not issue any permits for new sanitary landfills not having synthetic liners and leachate collection systems. 
                  (2)	The department of natural resources shall not issue any new permits for the land disposal of hazardous wastes. 
                  (3)	The department of natural resources shall require all new facilities permitted or to be permitted to treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste to perform such operations on an impermeable pad having a spill and leak collection systems. 
                  (4)	New above-ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. (Note: These figures are consistent with U.S. EPA rules for oil pollution prevention, 40 CFR 112.1). Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
                  (5)	New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within:
                  a.	High pollution susceptibility areas;
                  b.	A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15 acre-feet;
                  c.	A low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet.
                  (6)	New homes served by septic tank/drain field systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified on Table MT-1 of the Department of Human Resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereinafter "DHR Table MT-1"): 
                  a.	150 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; and

                  (1)	Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)	A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)	Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)	The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)	The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in [subsections] (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)	[Rules and regulations.] The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia," published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)	Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)	Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
                  (3)	Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)	Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
                  (5)	The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)	Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
                  (7)	Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)	Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)	To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)	Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)	Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
                  (12)	Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)	Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)	Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
                  (15)	Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.	Stream crossings for water lines; or
                  2.	Stream crossings for sewer lines; and
                  (16)	There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  1.	Stream crossings for water lines; or
                  2.	Stream crossings for sewer lines.
                  (d)	[Adoption of rules exceeding minimum requirements.] Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection (b) and (c) of this section. 
                  (e)	[Injury to the property of another.] The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 7-1-2009, § IV)
                  Sec. 26-75. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)	General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)	Application requirements. 
                  (1)	No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of City of Bainbridge without first obtaining a permit from the City of Bainbridge to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)	The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City of Bainbridge and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 26-74(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)	In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) and (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)	Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 26-74(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)	If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)	The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)	Plan requirements. 
                  (1)	Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 26-74(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)	Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)	Permits. 
                  (1)	Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)	No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 26-74(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)	Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)	If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)	The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)	The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Ord. of 7-1-2009, § V)
                  Sec. 26-76. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)	The City of Bainbridge will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)	The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)	The City of Bainbridge shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)	No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)	The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)	The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Sec. 26-77. - Penalties and incentives. 
                  (a)	Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)	Stop work orders. 
                  (1)	For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)	For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order; and 
                  (3)	All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; 
                  (4)	When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)	Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection (b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)	Monetary penalties. 
                  (1)	Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any City Charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

In addition, trees offer shade, reduce air pollution, prevent run-off and erosion, and provide a natural sound barrier. Therefore, it is the intent of this article to encourage the protection of trees through sound and responsible management, and to provide minimum criteria and direction toward that end. It is not the intent of this article to punish or to cause hardship to any individual, private or public company that exercises care and diligence to protect trees within the city.

The market value of the building should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement or, in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceed 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article.

                  (e)	Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)	In reviewing such requests, the board of adjustments and appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)	Conditions for variances:
                  (1)	A variance shall be issued only when there is:
                  a.	A finding of good and sufficient cause;
                  b.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)	The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighted carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest flood and stating that the cost of flood insurance will commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)	The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)	Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board of adjustments and appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

Structures located in AE or AH zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation provided, that all areas of the structure below the base flood elevation, plus one foot, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, are designed to be watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatics and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 30-68(4) and (5). 
                  (3)	Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-27, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones), or where base flood data have been provided without floodways, the following provisions apply: 
                  a.	When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 30-27, then the building official shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 3. If data is not available from these sources, then subsections b. and c. below, will apply. 
                  b.	No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  c.	In special flood areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the enclosed area (including basements) elevated no less than one foot above the highest adjacent grade, or 102 feet, whichever is higher, at the building site. The building official shall obtain an elevation certificate from a registered surveyor or registered engineer attesting to the record of the lowest floor elevation and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (4)	Elevated buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the base flood elevation formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
                  a.	Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.	Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.	The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
                  3.	Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
                  b.	So as not to violate the lowest floor criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.	The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)	Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. 
                  a.	All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on individual lots or parcels, in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or on a site in an existing manufactured home park or site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.	Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.	The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.	All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to the adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (see also section 30-68(5)) 
                  d.	All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
                  1.	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  2.	The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (5)a. and c. above. 
                  (6)	Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-27, are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions will apply: 
                  a.	Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer shall provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.	Only section 30-69(6)a. is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 30-52. 
                  (Code 1992, § 8-62; Ord. No. 521, art. 4, § B, 11-21-1995; Amend. of 8-7-2012)
                  Sec. 30-70. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
                  (a)	All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
                  (b)	All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
                  (c)	All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
                  (d)	Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions, which is greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less.

                  Numerous studies, including those published by the Surgeon General of the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency, the American Lung Association, World Health Organization, the National Research Council, and other organizations have established that the breathing of secondhand tobacco smoke or environmental tobacco smoke by nonsmokers is: 
                  (1)	A cause of disease, including lung cancer, in healthy nonsmokers;
                  (2)	A major contributor to indoor air pollution; and
                  (3)	Particularly harmful to children, elderly people, and allergic individuals.
                  Accordingly, the City Council of the City Bainbridge finds and declares that the purpose of this section is to protect the public health and welfare by regulating smoking in public places and places of employment.

Such goods or merchandise do not need to be attended for a sale to be deemed to be in existence. The term "yard sale" shall include garage sales, carport sales and similar types of sales or events. 
                  (b)	Location and manner of yard sales. Yard sales may be held on a lot or parcel of land upon which there is situated a house, apartment or other structure which is utilized primarily for residential purposes. Yard sales are prohibited upon vacant lots and upon lots upon which there is situated a structure that is utilized primarily for any use other than residential purposes. 
                  (c)	Number and duration. Yard sales shall be allowed not more than four times in any calendar year for any premises. No sale may run more than two consecutive days. 
                  (d)	Display area. All displays of yard sale merchandise shall be limited to that portion of the front yard area which is at least five feet back from the property line on all sides, and at least ten feet back from any curb or road edge. 
                  (e)	Religious and charitable organizations. Religious and charitable organizations exempt from federal taxation pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, may conduct yard sales on the property of the organization or at other locations within the city with the expressed written consent of the owner of the premises where the yard sale is being conducted. 
                  (f)	Permit required. At least 24 hours before any yard sale is conducted, a permit for the yard sale shall be obtained from the public safety department of the city, and a refundable permit fee in the amount established by resolution and on file with the city clerk shall be charged to ensure that any yard sale sign is removed within 24 hours after the conclusion of the yard sale. In the event the yard sale signs are not removed within 24 hours, the permit fee shall be forfeited. No signs pertaining to the yard sale shall be placed on public property. Signs may be placed on private property only with the permission of the property owner. During the course of the sale, the permit shall be prominently displayed so that it can be readily seen. 
                  (g)	Prohibited acts. 
                  (1)	No individual, firm, corporation or other partnership shall be permitted to engage in the business of promoting or conducting yard sales for others for a fee or other consideration. No merchandise shall be purchased in anticipation of resale at a yard sale. 
                  (2)	No yard sale shall be held on premises other than the premises of at least one of the persons conducting the yard sale except with the express written consent of the owner of the premises where the yard sale is being conducted.

                  (a)	Trade shows for such items as, but not limited to, guns, knives, coins, automobiles, boats and baseball cards may be held at any commercial location in the city. This type of show shall not exceed seven consecutive days and shall have two or more participants. The license holder shall be the promoter of the show and shall be responsible for all participants in the show. The individual participants in the show shall not be required to have a separate business license. This classification should not be confused with the transient/itinerant merchant regulations contained elsewhere in this code, specifically sections 42-37 through 42-39. The fee for such license to promote a trade show shall be as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges; provided, however, that no fee for such license will be required if the promoter is a religious, civic or other approved nonprofit organization. 
                  (b)	Applicants for a license under this section shall file with the city clerk a sworn application, in writing, which shall give the following information:

                  (6)	A statement as to whether or not the applicant has been convicted of any crime or misdemeanor, the nature of the offense and the punishment or penalty assessed therefor. 
                  (c)	Upon receipt of such application it shall be referred to the chief of police, who shall cause an investigation to be made as to all matters contained in the application. If, as a result of the investigation, it is determined that there has been a misrepresentation of any material fact in the application, or that the applicant has been convicted within the last five years for any offense against persons or property including, but not limited to, theft, burglary, robbery, obtaining goods under false pretenses, fraud, assault or battery, the chief of police shall recommend disapproval of the application. If upon investigation of the application it is determined that the information contained therein is correct and true and that there is no evidence that the applicant has been convicted of any offense described in this subsection, the chief of police shall recommend approval of the application. Upon completion of his investigation and making his recommendation, the chief of police shall transmit forthwith his recommendation to the city clerk. If the application is turned down for any reason, the applicant may appeal such decision to the mayor and city council at their next regular meeting. 
                  (d)	Any person, firm or corporation licensed under this section shall exhibit such license prominently at the location of the trade show. 
                  (e)	No license issued under this section shall be transferred for any reason.

                  (3)	Any violation of this section.
                  (4)	Conviction of any crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude.
                  (5)	Conducting the business in any unlawful manner, or in such a manner as to constitute a breach of the peace or to constitute a menace to the health, safety or general welfare of the public. 
                  (g)	Any person aggrieved by the action of the city clerk, chief of police or city manager in the denial or revocation of a license as provided in this section shall have the right to appeal such action to the mayor and city council at their next regular meeting. 
                  (h)	Any person violating this section shall, upon conviction, be penalized in accordance with section 1-7.

                  Sec. 42-143. - Purpose and Findings. 
                  (a)	Based on the demonstrated experience of other local governments, including, but not limited to, Peach County, Georgia; Smyrna, Georgia; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Garden Grove, California, and Houston, Texas, which experience the mayor and council have found to be relevant to certain problems that face the City of Bainbridge, Georgia, and based on the evidence reviewed by the mayor and council prior to the consideration of the ordinance codified in this article, the mayor and council take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, particularly the problems of crime, blight, and deterioration. 
                  (b)	Accordingly, the purpose of this chapter is to regulate certain types of businesses, including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. 
                  (c)	The following sections are intended to be a carefully tailored regulation to minimize the adverse land use impact caused by the undesirable secondary effects of adult bookstores, adult businesses and erotic dance establishments. The Mayor and Council find that restricting adult businesses to industrially zoned areas and imposing development standards can legitimately regulate adult businesses by establishing zones where adult businesses are most compatible with other uses or the surrounding neighborhood, and by requiring minimum distances to be maintained between adult business uses and other uses so as to afford the most protection to residential uses. 
                  (d)	This article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments and adult businesses versus the protected rights of such businesses and their patrons. It is not the intent of the Mayor and Council, in enacting this chapter, to deny to any person rights to speech protected by the United States or Georgia Constitutions, nor is it the intent to impose any additional limitations or restrictions on the contents of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented films, videotapes, books, or other materials. Further, the Mayor and Council do not intend to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain or view any sexually oriented materials protected by the United States or Georgia Constitutions, nor do they intend to restrict or deny any constitutionally protected rights that distributors or exhibitors of such sexually oriented materials may have to sell, distribute, or exhibit such constitutionally protected materials.

                  Sec. 42-167. - Adult bookstores and video stores; purpose. 
                  (a)	Based on the experiences of other municipalities and counties, including, but not limited to Houston, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Dayton, Ohio; Gwinnett County, Georgia; and Fulton County, Georgia which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by Bainbridge, Georgia, and based on documentary evidence and oral testimony presented by law enforcement personnel during the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners' public hearing and regular meeting on August 7, 2001, the mayor and council of the City of Bainbridge take note of the opportunity for unlawful sexual activities including, but not limited to, masturbation and oral and anal sex to occur at adult bookstores and video stores which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing materials, films, videos, or other reproductions depicting nudity, and for sexually transmitted diseases to spread as a result of the unhealthy conditions and unlawful activities associated with such booths, and the mayor and council further note that persons frequent such adult bookstores and video viewing booths for the purpose of engaging in sexual activities within such video viewing booths, and bodily fluids, including semen, urine and feces are found in such video viewing booths. 
                  (b)	The mayor and council find that removal of doors on such video viewing booths and prohibiting holes between such booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in such booths. The mayor and council therefore find that it is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the community to require that doors or other partitions on video viewing booths in adult bookstores and video stores be removed and that no holes be allowed to exist between adjoining booths.

                  (a)	Any person who generates scrap tires shall have a scrap tire generator identification number issued by the EPD. The identification number shall be used on scrap tire shipment manifests. Separate identification numbers shall be required for generators having multiple generation locations. 
                  (b)	Generators shall initiate a three-part manifest to transport scrap tires from the point of generation to an end user or to a scrap tire processing or disposal facility approved by the EPD. The manifest shall include the following information: 
                  (1)	Name and identification number of the generator;
                  (2)	Number of total tons (accurate to within ten percent of actual number) of scrap tires to be transported;

                  (4)	Date of transport; and
                  (5)	Destination of scrap tires.
                  (c)	If a generator chooses to use tons of tires rather than actual numbers of tires on the manifest for passenger and truck tires, the following conversion factor must be used: 
                  (1)	Passenger tires, 2,000 pounds (one ton) = 100 tires at 20 pounds per tire.
                  (2)	Truck tires, 2,000 pounds (one ton) = 20 tires at 100 pounds per tire.
                  (d)	Unless otherwise approved in writing by the EPD, generators shall assure that any person collecting and transporting scrap tires holds a valid scrap tire carrier permit issued by the EPD. 
                  (e)	Generators shall maintain receipts (copies of the completed manifest) for a period of three years. 
                  (f)	A generator shall report to the special enforcement division any carrier who fails to return a properly completed manifest to the generator within 30 days of scrap tire pickup as provided for in section EPD rule 391-4-19. Such report shall be filed within 30 days of failure of the carrier to comply. 
                  (g)	Generators may choose to determine whether a tire, because of wear, damage or defect, is not suitable for classification as a used tire or retreadable casing. However, if a generator fails to sort or delineate which tires are "used," "retreadable casings," or "scrap tires," all tires transported shall be considered scrap tires and must be thus indicated on the shipment manifest.

                  Editor's note—An amendment adopted Dec. 16, 2014, has been treated as superseding the provisions of ch. 62, and enacting new provisions to read as herein set out. Former ch. 62, "Signs," §§ 62-21—62-23, derived from the 1992 Code, §§ 13-201—13-203; and Ord. No. 501, §§ I—III, adopted May 19, 1992.
                  ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

                  Sec. 62-1. - Intent and purpose. 
                  Notwithstanding any other provisions of the City of Bainbridge Code of Ordinances, all signs in the City of Bainbridge that fall within the scope of chapter 62 of the City of Bainbridge Code of Ordinances shall be erected, constructed, or maintained in accordance with the provisions of these sections below and applicable chapters of the City of Bainbridge Zoning Ordinance as well as the Bainbridge Building Code. All signs regulated by this chapter shall comply with the applicable provisions of the Georgia Code on Erection and Maintenance of Outdoor Advertising, O.C.G.A. § 32-6-70 et seq., and shall meet all federal and state requirements necessary to obtain a permit under said code. In instances where the sign regulations in this chapter are more restrictive, the regulations in this chapter shall control. 
                  In adopting these sign regulations, it is the intent and purpose of the City of Bainbridge not to impose an outright ban on signs, but instead to: 
                  (1)	Balance the right of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
                  (2)	Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive land use planning;
                  (3)	Protect the public health, safety and welfare;
                  (4)	Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards;
                  (5)	Maintain the historical and cultural heritage and image of the city;
                  (6)	Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
                  (7)	Avoid the harmful aspects of the unrestricted proliferation of signs;
                  (8)	Promote economic development and tourism;
                  (9)	Protect private property values;
                  (10)	Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations; and
                  (11)	Protect views of the natural landscape and sky.
                  The mayor and city council have given careful consideration to the following studies and find them to be relevant to the City of Bainbridge, and useful in determining the proper regulation of the size, location, and number of sign structures in order to achieve the above-stated intents and purposes: University of Georgia Land Use Clinic (2003, June 26); Sign Control on Rural Corridors: Model Provisions and Guidance; Wisconsin Department of Transportation (1994, December); Milwaukee County Stadium Variable Message Sign Study: Impacts of an Advertising Variable Message Sign on Freeway Traffic; Scenic America (2007); Billboards in the Digital Age: Unsafe (and Unsightly) at Any Speed; Scenic America Issue Alert; Nasar, Jack L. and Hong, Xiaodong (1999, September); Visual Preferences in Urban Signscapes; Journal of Environment and Behavior, 31(5), 671-691; Office of Safety Research and Development, Federal Highway Administration (2001, September 11); Research Review of Potential Safety Effects of Electronic Billboards on Driver Attention and Distraction; U.S. Department of Transportation; New York State Department of State, Division of Local Government Services (2006, January); Municipal Control of Signs; James A.

                  In adopting these sign regulations, the Mayor and City Council of the City of Bainbridge have carefully considered and especially recognize the case law coming from Georgia courts, the federal courts, and courts throughout the United States, which recognize that the regulation of the size, location, and quantity of sign structures is a valid and lawful means of achieving the above-stated intents and purposes, and that such intents and purposes are valid and lawful governmental interests, which include the following: Granite State Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v. Cobb County, Ga., 193 Fed. Appx. 900 (C.A. 11th 2006)(finding that the stated goals within a sign ordinance of protecting against traffic hazards and the adverse impact on the county's aesthetic qualities are substantial government interests); Gregory v. Clive, 2007 WL 2914515 (Ga. S.Ct. 2007)(recognizing as within a local government's police power to enact legislation governing billboards and signs, as such legislation clearly addresses the public health, safety, or general welfare of the community); H & H Operations, Inc. v. City of Peachtree City, Ga., 248 Ga. 500 (1981)(holding that, under its police power, a municipality can enact and enforce reasonable regulations governing the erection and maintenance of signs within its jurisdiction); Harnish v. Manatee County, Florida, 783 F.2d 1535 (C.A. 11th 1986)(finding that aesthetics is a substantial governmental goal which is entitled to and should be accorded weighty respect, and that the governmental entity charged with the responsibility of protecting the environment must be given discretion in determining how much protection is necessary and the best method of achieving that protection); Lamar Advertising Company v. City of Douglasville, Ga., 254 F.Supp.2d 1321 (N.D.Ga. 2003)(finding that where a sign ordinance asserts the goals of public safety, traffic safety, health, welfare and aesthetics, a municipality has shown an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free speech); Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490 (1981)(holding that the goals of traffic safety and aesthetics advanced by a municipality as justification for regulating signs is a substantial governmental interest); St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. City of St. Louis, 249 U.S. 269 (1919)(finding that billboards may be prohibited in the residential districts of a city in the interest of the safety, morality, health and decency of the community); Members of the City Council of the City of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984)(finding that a government entity can regulate signs and billboards when necessary to advance a significant and legitimate state interest, such as the protection of the aesthetics and quality of life within its jurisdiction); City of Doraville v. Turner Communications, Corp., 236 Ga. 385 (1976)(finding that under its police power authority, a municipality can regulate the location and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs within their territorial jurisdiction); Spratlin Outdoor Media, Inc. v. City of Douglasville, 2006 WL 826077 (N.D.Ga. 2006)(upholding sign ordinance where the ordinance's height and setback restrictions were rationally related to its stated goals of promoting the health, safety, morality and general welfare of the community, promoting the orderly and beneficial development of the city, promoting adequate access to natural light and air, improving the aesthetic appearance of the city, and encouraging the most appropriate use of land and buildings in accordance with the city's comprehensive plan). 
                  (Amend. of 12-16-2014(1))
                  Sec. 62-2. - Scope. 
                  Chapter 62 regulates outdoor advertising signs abutting or visible from the limited access portions of State Route 1 and State Route 38 in the city. The City of Bainbridge has a tradition and reputation as a scenic and historic area with a rich mix of land uses that blend into a landscape of high aesthetic quality. Depending on their size, numbers and character, signs may attract or repel visitors, affect the daily visual quality of residents, affect the safety of vehicular traffic, and define the character of the area. Thus, aesthetic considerations impact economic values as well as public health, safety, and welfare.

                  Sec. 62-24. - Permitting process 
                  (a)	Permit required. Except as otherwise provided herein, it shall be unlawful for any person to erect, construct, enlarge, move, or convert any sign regulated by this chapter or cause the same to be done without first obtaining a sign permit from the city. These directives shall not be construed to require any permit for change of copy on any sign, replacement of the sign face, nor for the repainting, cleaning, or other normal maintenance or repair of a sign or sign structure for which a permit has previously been issued, so long as the sign or sign structure is not modified or enlarged in any way. 
                  (b)	Application. Sign permits may be applied for by the owner of the property upon which the sign will be located, or by that person or entity's authorized agent. In order to obtain a permit to erect, alter, or relocate any sign under the provisions of this chapter, an applicant therefor shall submit to the zoning administrator a sign permit application which shall set forth in writing a complete description of the proposed sign including: 
                  (1)	The name, address, and telephone number of the owner or persons entitled to possession of the sign and of the sign contractor or erector; 
                  (2)	The name, address and telephone number of the owner or lessee of the lot on which the sign is located if different from those designated above;

                  (c)	Issuance of permit if application in order. It shall be the duty of the zoning administrator, upon receipt of a completed application for a sign permit, to examine such plans and specifications and other data and, if the proposed structure is in compliance with the requirements of this section and all other applicable provisions of this chapter, to issue within ten business days from the date of filing to the applicant a written permit evidencing the applicant's compliance therewith. Sign permits shall be issued in the name of the property owner upon which the sign is to be located. Issuance of the permit shall in no way prevent the city from later declaring said sign to be nonconforming if the permit is obtained based on false information submitted by the applicant. 
                  (d)	Rejection of permit application. If the permit application is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, then within ten business days of the filing of the application, the zoning administrator shall provide to the applicant in writing the reasons such permit was not approved. 
                  (e)	Permit duration. A sign permit shall become null and void if the construction of the sign for which the permit was issued has not begun within a period of six months after the date of issuance and completed within 12 months after date of issuance. 
                  (f)	Work on illegal signs. No person shall erect or assist in the erection, construction, maintenance, alteration, relocation, repair or painting of, or do any work upon any sign for which a permit has not been obtained. Any such sign shall be illegal, and the zoning administrator shall order the owner to remove the same immediately. If the owner fails to remove the same within 30 days, the zoning administrator shall proceed in accordance with this chapter. 
                  (g)	Inspection. All signs for which a permit is required by this chapter are subject to inspection by the zoning administrator or his designee. 
                  (h)	Revocation. The zoning administrator is hereby authorized and empowered to revoke any sign permit upon failure of the holder thereof to comply with the provisions of this chapter within 30 days after notification in writing. 
                  (i)	Permit fees. Before any permit is issued under the provisions of this chapter, the applicant shall pay a fee in accordance with the city fee schedule. 
                  (j)	Appeals. Appeals of decisions of the zoning administrator regarding the issuance, denial or other official action upon a sign permit shall be to the mayor and city council. The aggrieved party shall file such appeal in writing within 15 days of the date of the appealed decision. The mayor and city council shall consider the appeal at a public meeting conducted within 35 days of the filing of the appeal. The aggrieved party or its agent, city staff, and other interested parties shall be allowed to present testimony and evidence as to whether the decision should be affirmed, reversed or modified. Such testimony and evidence shall constitute the record. The mayor and city council shall consider this record in light of the requirements and intent of this chapter and shall vote to affirm, reverse or modify the decision at such public meeting. In the event that the mayor and city council fail to render a decision on the appeal within 36 days of the filing of the notice of appeal, the decision appealed shall stand affirmed. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the mayor and city council may appeal to the Superior Court of Decatur County, Georgia, within 30 days of the mayor and city council's decision.

                  Sec. 62-25. - Enforcement and remedies. 
                  In case any sign or sign structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, converted or maintained in violation of this chapter as well as applicable chapters in the City of Bainbridge Zoning Ordinance and Bainbridge Building Code, the zoning administrator or any other appropriate authority of the city may, in addition to other remedies, and after notice required by this chapter, issue a citation for violation of this City Code or zoning ordinance, requiring the presence of the violator in the municipal court; institute an action for injunctive relief; or institute other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent or abate such violation. 
                  Where a violation of this Code is deemed to exist by the zoning administrator with respect to a sign or sign structure, the zoning administrator may, in addition to other remedies, notify the building inspector of such violation and direct, require, or encourage that public utility service be withheld therefrom until such time as the structure or premises is no longer in violation of these regulations. 
                  The building inspector or zoning administrator may revoke a permit upon a finding that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving, demolition, installation, or replacement of a sign or sign structure or electrical system for which a sign permit was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of this Code or the building code. The building inspector or zoning administrator may upon notice order work to be immediately ceased on any sign or sign structure or electrical system that is being done contrary to the provisions of the technical codes or in a dangerous or unsafe manner.

This application shall be in writing, upon forms provided by the city for that purpose and shall contain information showing the type of construction, the width of the driveway, the exact location of the driveway and any other information which may be required by the city to determine if the driveway will in any way affect the drainage system of the city. Before any such permit is issued the building official shall receive a recommendation from the public works director of the city. The permit fee for a driveway shall be an amount as determined from time to time by the city council and listed in the schedule of fees and charges maintained in the city manager's office. No permit shall be issued for any driveway approach that will not comply with all ordinances or that will endanger public safety.

                  (d)	Backing onto streets prohibited. No drive or series of driveway approaches serving other than residential property shall be permitted to be constructed in such a way that the exit from such property would be accomplished by backing vehicles into a street right-of-way or roadway.

When a commercial establishment controls 75 feet or more of street frontage, the number of driveway approaches shall be limited to two for the first 75 feet or part thereof and not more than one additional driveway approach for each additional 75 feet in excess of the initial 75 feet. No portion of a driveway approach shall be less than two feet away from the property line not located at an intersection. When only one lane of traffic is provided in a single driveway the width of the driveway approach shall not exceed 20 feet. 
                  (f)	Policy concerning construction and maintenance by city. It shall be the policy of the city that the city will not construct nor maintain private driveways for a fee or otherwise. When driveway maintenance is required as a result of an action taken by the city or an inaction on the part of the city which causes driveway damage, the city may make such necessary driveway repairs as deemed to be appropriate and with the approval of the city manager. Every practical effort shall be made to eliminate the necessity of the future repair by the city.

                  ARTICLE II. - TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS 

                  Sec. 74-21. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Collocation means the use of a common support structure by two or more wireless licensed holders. 
                  Communication antenna means an antenna designed to transmit or receive communications as authorized by the Federal Communications Commission. 
                  Communication tower means a tower greater than 70 feet in height (including antenna) which supports communication, transmission, or receiving equipment. The term communication tower shall not include amateur radio operator's equipment including citizens band (CB), ham radio, or other similar operators whose tower including antenna is less than 70 feet in height. Design examples of communication towers are described as follows: 
                  (1)	Self-supporting.
                  (2)	Guyed.
                  (3)	Monopole.
                  Height means the distance measured from the ground level to the highest point of the structure including the antenna array.

                  Sec. 74-22. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)	The mayor and board of aldermen of the city finds that the number, height, design characteristic, and location of telecommunications towers and antennas in the city directly affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city. The mayor and board of aldermen of the city find that such structures are likely to substantially increase in number in the future and further find that such structures when inappropriately located have the potential to pose a danger to surrounding property owners and the general public and substantially detract from the beauty of the city. 
                  (b)	The board further finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety, and welfare to comprehensively address those concerns through the adoption of this article. 
                  (Code 1992, § 19-193; Ord. No. 551, § 3, 4-7-1998)
                  Sec. 74-23. - Applicability. 
                  This article shall apply to communication towers as defined herein located in the city. This article does not affect the location of satellite dishes for the purpose of receiving only, of a television signal. 
                  (Code 1992, § 19-194; Ord. No. 551, § 4, 4-7-1998)
                  Sec. 74-24. - Exemptions. 
                  The requirements of this article shall not apply to communication towers which are: 
                  (1)	Used for governmental purposes.
                  (2)	Permitted for a specific site on the effective date of this article.
                  (3)	Used by amateur radio operators including citizens band (CB), ham radio, or other similar radio operators whose communications tower is less than 70 feet in height including the antenna and the placement of an antenna on a nonconforming structure shall not be considered an expansion of the nonconforming structure. 
                  (Code 1992, § 19-195; Ord. No. 551, § 5, 4-7-1998)
                  Sec. 74-25. - Location and design standards. 
                  The following standards shall apply to all new or expanded communications towers except as specified in section 74-24: 
                  (1)	Location. Communication towers are allowed in C (Highway Commercial) districts and I (industrial) districts only. 
                  a.	The applicant shall make every effort to locate such tower in a location which will minimize the impact of the antenna structure due to height, use, or appearance of the adjacent structures or surrounding area. The applicant must certify that there are no existing buildings or other structures located within the area where the communication tower is proposed that are available to the applicant for the intended purpose. The applicant must also show on a map all structures in the area, if any, which would meet the applicant's requirement if they were available. 
                  b.	That the antenna structure as proposed shall be the minimum height necessary to satisfy the applicant's communication system needs for that location. 
                  (2)	Design and construction. The following criteria shall apply to the design and construction of communication towers: 
                  a.	The applicant must obtain all other applicable permits to include the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Aviation Administration before a city construction permit will be issued. 
                  b.	All towers shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the appropriate standards as published by the Electronic Industry Association as may be amended from time to time and a tower construction professional shall certify that such standards are met prior to the issuance of the construction permit. 
                  c.	All tower supports and peripheral anchors shall be located within the parcel of property where the tower is located. 
                  d.	Towers shall not be lighted except as may be required by the Federal Communications Commission or the Federal Aviation Administration. 
                  e.	All accessory buildings and structures shall comply with other applicable provisions of the zoning and building codes of the city. 
                  f.	Tower bases that are visible from roads or highways or residential areas or other public view must be landscaped. The mayor and city council must approve all landscaping plans. Existing mature tree growth and natural vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the extent feasible; provided, however, that vegetation that causes interference with the antenna or inhibits access to the equipment facility may be trimmed or cleared provided the necessary permits are obtained for tree removal. The tower owner shall maintain the landscaping and/or screening. 
                  (3)	Collocation. Owners of communication towers must provide access to other communication tower users including governments if it can be done without interference to the owner's use. The charge for use of an owner's tower shall be determined by the owner of such tower but shall not be unreasonable. 
                  (4)	Setbacks. A communications tower structure, building, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum yard requirements for the zoning district in which they are located. The use of concealed antenna support structure does not exempt a tower from the minimum yard requirements. Tower structure must be placed no closer than a distance equal to the height of the tower structure from any residentially zoned district or residential structure, whichever is greater in distance. A communications tower may be located on a site containing another principal use in the same buildable area. 
                  (5)	Security fencing. All communication towers are required to provide security fencing around the perimeter having a height of not less than six feet. All fencing shall be of galvanized-coated wire or decay resistance materials and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device. 
                  (6)	Denial. The denial of a requested permit shall be in writing and shall state the reason for such denial. 
                  (Code 1992, § 19-196; Ord. No. 551, § 6, 4-7-1998)
                  Sec. 74-26. - Advertising. 
                  No advertising shall be allowed on the tower structure. 
                  (Code 1992, § 19-197; Ord. No. 551, § 7, 4-7-1998)
                  Sec. 74-27. - Removal of communication towers and facilities. 
                  All communication towers shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained and applicable building and technical codes so as to ensure the strength and integrity of such facilities. If upon inspection such tower is determined not to comply with codes or to constitute a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the facility and the owner of the property if such owner is different, said owners shall have 30 days to bring such facility into compliance. In the event such communication tower is not brought into compliance within 30 days, the city may provide notice to the owners requiring that the tower be removed. In the event such communication tower is not removed within 30 days of receipt of such notice, the city may remove such facility and place a lien upon the property for the cost of removal. Delay by the city to take such action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may pursue any legal remedy available to it to ensure that towers not in compliance with this Code or which constitute a danger to persons or property be brought into compliance or removed. 
                  (Code 1992, § 19-198; Ord. No. 551, § 8, 4-7-1998)
                  Sec. 74-28. - Abandoned communication facilities. 
                  (a)	Any communications tower that is not operated for a continuous period of six months shall be considered abandoned whether or not the owner or operator intends to make future use of tower. The owner of an abandoned tower and the owner of the property where the tower is located shall be under a duty to remove such tower. If said tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the city notifying the owner(s) of such abandonment, the city may remove said tower and place a lien upon the property for the cost of removal. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that abandoned towers are removed. Delay by the city taking action shall not in anyway waive the city's right to take action. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that communication towers not in compliance with this Code or which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed. 
                  (b)	If the owner of a communication tower declared abandoned wishes to use such communication tower, the owner must first apply for and receive all applicable permits and make all of the conditions of this article as required for the initial placement of the communication tower. 
                  (Code 1992, § 19-199; Ord. No. 551, § 9, 4-7-1998)
                  Sec. 74-29. - Federal requirement. 
                  All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owner of the tower and antenna governed by this ordinance shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations in compliance with the appropriate federal requirement. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower and/or antenna at the owner's expense in accordance with section 74-27.

                  (a)	Purpose. 
                  (1)	The purpose of this section is to assist the customer and inspectors in protecting the customer's own potable water system against actual or potential backflow and/or back siphonage of any contamination or pollution by controlling each cross connection or potential cross connection on said customer's premises. 
                  (2)	To protect the city's potable water system against actual or potential backflow by containing within the customer's premises any contamination or pollution that has entered or may enter the customer's potable water system through an undiscovered or uncontrolled cross connection on said premises. 
                  (3)	To eliminate uncontrolled connections to nonpotable systems as well as uncontrolled interconnections to any potable water system by installing an appropriate backflow prevention device or devices to isolate or contain such systems from that of the city's water system. 
                  (4)	To establish, coordinate, execute and maintain a total backflow prevention program.
                  (5)	To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross connection control that will systematically and effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of city's potable water system. 
                  (b)	Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Auxiliary water supply means any water supply on or available to the premises other than the city's approved public water supply. These auxiliary water supplies may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply and any natural sources such as wells, springs, rivers, streams, harbors, and so forth; used waters; or industrial fluids. These waters may be contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the city does not have sanitary control. 
                  Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow in a potable water distribution system as the result of a cross connection. 
                  Backflow preventer means an assembly or means designed to prevent backflow which may consist of: 
                  (1)	Air gap: An unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening of any pipe or faucet conveying water or waste to a tank, plumbing fixture, receptor, or other assembly and the flood level rim of the receptacle. These vertical, physical separations must be at least twice the diameter of the water supply outlet less than one inch (25 millimeters). 
                  (2)	Reduced-pressure backflow prevention assembly: The approved reduced-pressure principal backflow prevention assembly consists of two independently acting approved check valves together with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent pressure differential relief valve located between the check valves and below the first check value. These units are located between two tightly closely seated shutoff valves as an assembly and equipped with properly located resilient seated test cocks. 
                  (3)	Double check valve assembly: The approved double check valve assembly consists of the two internally loaded check valves, either spring loaded or internally weighted, installed as a unit between two tightly closing resilient seated shutoff valves and fittings with properly located resilient-seated test cocks. This assembly shall only be used to protect against nonhealth hazard pollutants. 
                  Backpressure means a pressure higher than the supply pressure caused by a pump, elevated tank, boiler, or any other means that may cause backflow. 
                  Back-siphonage means backflow caused by a negative or reduced pressure in the supply piping. 
                  Contamination means an impairment of a potable water supply by the introduction or admission of any foreign substance that degrades the quality and creates a health hazard. 
                  Cross connection means a connection or potential connection between any part of the potable water system and any other environment containing substances in a manner that, under any circumstances would allow such substances to enter the potable water system. Other substances may be gases, liquids, or solids, such as chemicals, waste products, steam, water from other sources (potable or nonpotable), or any matter that may change the color or add odor to the water. 
                  Cross connection control by containment means the installation of an approved backflow prevention system at the water service connection to any customer's premises, where it is physically and economically unfeasible to find and permanently eliminate or control all actual or potential cross connections within the customer's water system; or it shall mean the installation of an approved backflow-prevention assembly on the service line leading to and supplying a portion of the customer's water system where there are actual or potential cross connections that cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of the cross connection. 
                  Cross connections, controlled means a connection between a potable water system and a nonpotable water system with an approved backflow prevention assembly properly installed and maintain so that it will continuously afford the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard. 
                  Degree of hazard means the term is derived from an evaluation of the potential risk to public health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable water system. 
                  (4)	Hazard, health: A cross connection or potential cross connection involving any substance that could, if introduced in the potable water supply, cause death, illness, severe disease, or have a high probability of causing such effects. 
                  (5)	Hazard, nonhealth: A cross connection or potential cross connection involving any substance that generally would not be a health hazard but could constitute a nuisance or be aesthetically objectionable, if introduced in to the potable water supply. 
                  (6)	Hazard, plumbing: A plumbing type cross connection in a consumer's potable water system that has not been properly protected by an approved air gap or an approved backflow prevention assembly. 
                  (7)	Hazard, system: An actual or potential threat of severe damage to the physical properties of the public potable water system or the consumer's potable water system or of a pollution or contamination that would have a protracted effect on the quality of the potable water in the system. 
                  Industrial fluids system means any system containing a fluid or solution that may be chemically, biologically, or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration, such as would constitute a health, system, pollution, or plumbing hazard, if introduced into an approved potable water system. This may include, but not be limited to: polluted or contaminated waters; all types of process waters and used waters originating from the public potable water system that may have deteriorated in sanitary quality; chemicals in fluid form; plating acids and alkalies; circulating cooling waters connected to an open cooling tower; and/or cooling towers that are chemically or biologically treated or stabilize with toxic substances; contaminated natural waters such as wells, springs, streams, rivers, bays, harbors, seas, irrigation canals or systems, and so forth; oils, gases, glycerin, paraffins, caustic and acid solutions, and other liquid and gaseous fluids used in industrial or other purposes for firefighting purposes. 
                  Pollution means the presence of any foreign substance in water that tends to degrade the quality so as to constitute a nonhealth hazard or impair the usefulness of the water. 
                  Service connection means the terminal end of a service connection from the public potable water system, that is, where the water purveyor loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the customer's water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service connection, then the service connection shall mean the downstream end of the meter. There shall be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of any meter or backflow prevention assembly located at the point of delivery to the customer's water system. Service connection shall also include water service connection from a fire hydrant or any other temporary or emergency water connections from the public potable water system of the city. 
                  Water, potable means water that is safe for human consumption as described by the public health authority having jurisdiction. 
                  Water, used means any water supplied by the city from the city potable water supply system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary control of the city. 
                  Water superintendent the superintendent in charge of the water department of the city is charged with the responsibility for implementation of an effective cross connection control program and for the enforcement of the provisions of this section. 
                  (c)	Requirements. 
                  (1)	The water system shall be considered as made up of two parts: the utility system and the customer system. 
                  (2)	Utility system shall consist of the source facilities and the distribution system and shall include all those facilities of the water system under the complete control of the water department of the city up to the point where the customer system begins. 
                  (3)	The source shall include all components of the facilities utilized in the production, treatment, storage and delivery of water to the distribution system. 
                  (4)	The distribution system shall include the network of conduits used for the delivery of water from the source to the customer's system. 
                  (5)	The customer's system shall include those parts of the facilities beyond the termination of the system of the city that are utilized in conveying domestic water on the customer's side of the meter to points of use. 
                  (d)	Policy. 
                  (1)	No water service connection to any premises, residential, commercial, or industrial, shall be installed or maintained by the city unless the water supplied by the city is protected as required by state laws and regulations and this section. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the city if a backflow prevention assembly required by this section is not installed and tested and maintained or if it is found that the backflow prevention assembly has been removed, bypassed, or if an unprotected cross connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected. All residential installations in existence prior to the adoption of this section shall be allowed to continue so long as there is no known backflow or cross connection hazard in existence and until the water service to the residential premises is required to be retrofitted for whatever reason. 
                  (2)	The customer's system shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the city water department to determine whether cross connections or other structural or sanitary hazards, including violations of these regulations, exist. When such a condition becomes known, the water superintendent shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the condition or conditions in conformance with state law or city regulations relating to plumbing or water supply and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto. 
                  (3)	An approved backflow prevention assembly shall be installed on each service line to a customer's water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served; but in all cases, before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the following conditions exist: 
                  a.	In the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply that is not or may not be safe bacteriologically or chemically and that is not acceptable as an additional source by the water superintendent, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard. 
                  b.	In the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substances are handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing an approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line, appropriate to the degree of hazard. This shall include the handling of process water and waters originating from the utility system that have been subjected to deterioration in quality. 
                  (4)	In the case of premises having: (i) internal cross connections that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled or; (ii) intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes making it impractical or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous cross connections exist, the city shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing approved backflow prevention assembly in the service line. 
                  (5)	The type of protective assembly required shall depend upon the degree of hazard that exists as follows: In the case of any premises where an auxiliary water supply is used said auxiliary water supply shall be separated from the city water system by an approved air gap separation. The auxiliary water supply cannot be connected in anyway to the city system. 
                  (6)	In the case of any premises where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly. 
                  (7)	In the case of any premises where there is any material danger to health that is handled in such fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap separation. Example: premises where these conditions exist include sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, chemical manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries, and plating plants. 
                  (8)	In the case of any premises where there are uncontrolled cross connections either actual or potential, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly at the service connection. 
                  (9)	In the case of any premises where because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impractical or impossible to make a complete in-plant cross connection survey, the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by either an approved air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention assembly on each service to the premises. 
                  (10)	In the case of any premises where in the opinion of the water superintendent an undue health threat is posed because of the presence of an extreme toxic substance, the water superintendent may require an air gap at the service connection to protect public water system. This requirement will be at the discretion of the water superintendent and is dependent upon the degree of hazard. 
                  (11)	Any backflow prevention assembly required herein shall be a model and size approved by the water superintendent. The term "approved backflow prevention assembly" shall mean an assembly that has been manufactured in full conformance with the standards established by the American Water Works Association titled: 
                  AWWA C510-89—Standard for Double Check Valve Backflow Prevention Assembly; and 
                  AWWA C511-89—Standard for Reduced Pressure Principle Backflow Prevention Assembly, 
                  and have met completely the laboratory and field conformance specifications of the Foundation of Cross Connection Control and Hydraulic Research of the University of Southern California established by "Specification of Backflow Prevention Assemblies," Section 10 of the most current issue of the Manual of Cross Connection Control. Final approval may be evidence by a "Certificate of Approval" issued by an approved testing laboratory certifying full compliance with AWWA standards and specifications. Testing laboratories shall be approved by the water superintendent of the city. 
                  (12)	It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premises with a service size of two inches or greater where backflow prevention assemblies are installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once per year of said devices. In those instances where the water superintendent deems the hazard to be great enough, certified inspections may be required at more frequent intervals. These inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by the assembly manufacturers representative, the city personnel, or by a certified tester approved by the water superintendent. It shall be the duty of the water superintendent to see that these tests are made in a timely manner. The customer-user shall notify the water superintendent in advance when the tests are to be undertaken so that the water superintendent may witness the test if so desired. These assemblies shall be repaired, overhauled, or replaced at the expense of the customer-user whenever said assemblies are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs, and overhauls shall be kept and made available to the water superintendent. 
                  (13)	All presently installed backflow prevention assemblies that do not meet the requirements of this section but were approved assemblies for the purpose described herein at the time of installation and that have been properly maintained shall except for the inspection and maintenance requirements under this ordinance be excluded from the requirements of these rules so long as the water superintendent is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the city water system. Whenever an existing assembly is moved from the present location, requires more than a minimum maintenance, or when the water superintendent finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow prevention assembly meeting the requirements of this section.

                  (2)	As a Full-Time Employee of the Employer employed prior to August 1, 1980, when application of this subparagraph (2) would result in a higher benefit for said Participant than the preceding subparagraph (1), shall be determined as one-twelfth (1/12) of: one percent (1%) of the Participant's Final Average Earnings up to the amount of Covered Compensation plus one and three-fourths percent (1¾%) of Final Average Earnings in excess of the Covered Compensation, multiplied by years of Total Credited Service.

                  (3)	Total Credited Service, both past and future, shall be the sum of Credited Past and Credited Future Service. The amount of Total Credited Service for any Participant shall be unlimited.

                  a.	If the employment of a Participant is terminated by reason of death prior to his having completed ten (10) years of Total Credited Service in the Plan, or prior to attaining Normal Retirement Date, no benefit shall be payable under the Plan to any heirs, assigns, or to the Participant's estate.

Upon completion of ten (10) years of Total Credited Service, or upon attaining Normal Retirement Date, a Participant may designate one and only one Beneficiary prior to Retirement on a form provided for that purpose. In so doing, he specifically provides thereby that in the event his employment is terminated by reason of his death prior to Retirement that his designated and surviving Beneficiary prior to Retirement shall receive a Retirement benefit in the amount of the decreased retirement benefit that would have been otherwise payable to said Participant had he retired on the day of his death and elected the optional form of Retirement payment designated herein as Option A at one hundred (100) percent. Said monthly benefit shall commence, at the option of the Beneficiary, no earlier than the first day of the month following what would have been the Participant's Early Retirement Date or Normal Retirement Date, whichever is applicable.

                  (b)	If the Participant has elected an optional form of payment, as provided in Article VI and his designated Joint Annuitant or Beneficiary in Retirement survives him, benefits shall be payable to the Beneficiary in Retirement or Joint Annuitant as provided in the option elected.

In the event a guardian of the estate of any person receiving or claiming benefits under the Plan shall be appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction, payments shall be made to such guardian provided that proper proof of appointment is furnished in a form and manner suitable to the Pension Committee. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of liability therefor under the Plan.

                  (b)	To any action or proceeding involving any rights under the Plan or the proper administration thereof, the City and the Pension Committee shall be the only necessary parties and no Participant, or his Beneficiary, Joint Annuitant, or any other persons having or claiming to have an interest in the Plan shall be entitled to any notice or process. Any final judgment which is not appealed or appealable that may be entered in any such action or proceeding shall be binding and conclusive on the parties hereto and all persons having or claiming to have an interest in the Plan. 
                  Sec. 7. - Claims. 
                  Any payment to a Participant, Joint Annuitant, or Beneficiary, or to their legal representatives, in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, shall to the extent thereof be in full satisfaction of all claims hereunder against the Pension Committee or the City, either of which may require such Participant, Beneficiary, Joint Annuitant, or legal representative, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a receipt and release therefor in such form as shall be determined by the Pension Committee or the City, as the case may be.
