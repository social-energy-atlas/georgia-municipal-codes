# Georgia Municipal Code Dataset
## Social Responsibility CODEC Lab (formerly the Social Energy Atlas) - University of Georgia

## Overview
This repository is home to copies of the Codes of Ordinances for each municipality in the State of Georgia, USA. As this project is a work in progress, there will be regular updates. Currently, the project team is processing the text files downloaded from Municode to create structure for future text analysis through machine learning.
