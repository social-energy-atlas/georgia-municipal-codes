PREFACE
This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Turner County, Georgia.
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of
each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the
section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back
of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein.
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have
been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been
included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.
Chapter and Section Numbering System
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes.
Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure
after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the
first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be
inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that
would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and
new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the
subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be
assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be
taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters.
Page Numbering System
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which
represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In
the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to
the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of
ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of
which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government
officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the
user to the particular item in which the user is interested.
Looseleaf Supplements
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this
system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or
pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of
inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received,
it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is
strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and,
in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
Acknowledgments
This publication was under the direct supervision of Milton E. Lefkoff, Senior Code Attorney, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the
Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere
interest and able assistance throughout the project.
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. John Holland, County Attorney, and Ms. Mary J. Wynn, County Clerk, for their cooperation and
assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a
Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the
day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

Editor's note— Printed herein is 1927 Ga. Laws (Act No. 273), page 702, which created the board of commissioners of roads and
revenues for Turner County, Georgia. Amendments to the act are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended
provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act. Obvious misspellings
have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes
have been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets.
Sec.	1.	-	Established;	composition;	membership.
There is established in Turner County a board of commissioners which shall be the governing authority of said county
and shall be composed of five members, as hereinafter provided. For purposes of electing members to the board, Turner
County shall be divided into five commissioner districts which shall be and correspond to those five numbered districts
described in and attached to and made a part of this Act and further identified as Plan Name: turnerwk01 Plan Type:
Local User: staff Administrator: Turner.
When used in such attachment, the terms `Tract' and `BG' (Block Group) shall mean and describe the same geographical
boundaries as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the
State of Georgia. The separate numeric designations in a Tract description which are underneath a `BG' heading shall
mean and describe individual Blocks within a Block Group as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the
United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Any part of Turner County which is not included in any
such district described in that attachment shall be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the
least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Any part of Turner
County which is described in that attachment as being in a particular district shall nevertheless not be included within
such district if such part is not contiguous to such district. Such noncontiguous part shall instead be included within that
district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of
2000 for the State of Georgia. Except as otherwise provided in the description of any commissioner district, whenever the
description of such district refers to a named city, it shall mean the geographical boundaries of that city as shown on the
census map for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia.
All members of the board of commissioners shall not be less than 25 years of age and shall be qualified electors of
Turner County. Each of the commissioners shall have been a resident of his respective commissioner district for at least
12 months prior to the date of taking office. In the event that any member ceases to be a resident of his respective
commissioner district during his term of office, a vacancy shall be created and shall be filled in the manner hereinafter
provided. Each of the members shall be elected by the qualified voters of Turner County residing within his respective
commissioner district. In all elections conducted pursuant to this Act, each candidate shall designate, at the time of
qualifying, the district from which he offers as a candidate. To be elected as a member of the board, a candidate must
receive the highest number of votes cast for the seat he is seeking; and, at the same time, a candidate must receive a
majority of the total votes cast for the election of a commissioner to that seat. In the event no candidate for a particular
seat receives a majority of the votes for the seat he is seeking, a runoff election shall be conducted for that particular
seat. All members shall be nominated and elected in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. tit. 21, ch. 2 (O.C.G.A. §
21-2-1 et seq.), the `Georgia Election Code,' as now or hereafter amended.

affirmation in the form herein provided, or its equivalent, and shall affix his signature thereto. The judge or clerk may, at
the request of any individual, prepare the statement of claim and other papers required to be filed in an action.

registered or certified mail is returned to sender by United States postal authorities marked "refused", giving the date of
refusal, and such notation of refusal is signed or initialed by a United States Postal Service employee or United States
mail carrier to whom refusal was made, then the clerk or judge shall attach the same to the original statement and notice

affidavit shall be heard and determined by the judge of said Small Claims Court, and the judge shall be entitled to ten dollars ($10.00) for
every such claim case. The same practice and procedure shall apply in cases of affidavits of illegality. The plaintiff in attachment or
plaintiff in execution may make written demand for a trial by jury within five days after a claim affidavit and bond is filed with the levying
officer. The party demanding such trial shall deposit with the court a sum sufficient to defray the expenses of such trial, including the

the plaintiff.

twelve veniremen, the plaintiff and defendant having three strikes each. The judge or clerk shall have the power to subpoena jurymen
and witnesses.

Sec.	1.	-	Eligibility	requirements;	application	procedures.
Article VII, Section I, Paragraph IV of the Constitution is hereby amended by adding at the end thereof the following:
Any other provisions of this Constitution to the contrary notwithstanding, each resident of Turner County who is 62 years of age or
over or who is disabled is hereby granted an exemption from all Turner County and Turner County School District ad valorem taxes,
including ad valorem taxes to pay interest on and retire bonded indebtedness, in the amount of $8,000.00 on a homestead owned and
occupied by him as a residence, if his adjusted gross income, together with the adjusted gross income of his spouse who also occupies
and resides at such homestead, does not exceed $10,000.00 for the immediately preceding taxable year. For the purposes of this
paragraph, the term `adjusted gross income' shall have the same meaning as the term defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as
now or hereafter amended, except that adjusted gross income shall not include income or benefits which are received as retirement,
survivor or disability benefits under the Federal Social Security Act, or under any other public or private retirement, disability or pension
system, except such income or benefits which are in excess of the maximum amount authorized to be received by an individual and his
spouse under the Federal Social Security Act, as now or hereafter amended. The value of the residence in excess of the above exempted
amount shall remain subject to taxation. In order to qualify for the exemption provided for herein as being disabled, the person
claiming such exemption shall be required to obtain a certificate from not more than two physicians licensed to practice medicine under
the laws of Georgia, as now or hereafter amended, certifying that in the opinion of such physician or physicians such person is mentally
or physically incapacitated to the extent that such person is unable to be gainfully employed and that such incapacity is likely to be
permanent. Any such owner shall not receive the benefits of such homestead exemption unless he or his agent files an affidavit with the
Tax Commissioner of Turner County, giving his age, or if disabled the certificate or certificates provided for herein, and the amount of
income which he and his spouse received during the last taxable year for income tax purposes; and such additional information relative
to receiving the benefits of such exemption as will enable the Tax Commissioner to make a determination as whether such owner is
entitled to such exemption. The Tax Commissioner shall provide affidavit forms for this purpose. Such applications shall be processed in
the same manner as other applications for homestead exemption, and the provisions of law applicable to the processing of homestead
exemptions, as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, shall apply thereto. Provided, that after any such owner has filed the
proper affidavit, and certificate or certificates if disabled, as provided above, and has been allowed the exemption provided herein, it
shall not be necessary that he make application and file the said affidavit and certificate thereafter for any year and the said exemption
shall continue to be allowed to such owner. It shall be the duty of any such owner, however, to notify the Tax Commissioner in the event
he becomes ineligible for any reason for the exemption provided in this paragraph. The General Assembly may provide by law for the
proper administration of this exemption, including penalties necessary therefor. It is specifically provided that the homestead
8/30/2019 Turner County, GA Code of Ordinances

exemption provided for herein shall not apply to the one-quarter mill ad valorem tax levied by the state, but in all other respects such
homestead exemption shall supersede and replace a homestead exemption from county taxes for residents of Turner County who are
65 years of age or over and a homestead exemption from school taxes for Turner County residents who are 62 years of age or over
when such homestead exemptions have been provided by previously existing provisions of this Constitution. The homestead

Doing an act that is prohibited or made or declared unlawful, an offense or a misdemeanor by ordinance or by rule
or regulation authorized by ordinance;
Failure to perform an act that is required to be performed by ordinance or by rule or regulation authorized by
ordinance; or
Failure to perform an act if the failure is declared a misdemeanor or an offense or unlawful by ordinance or by rule
or regulation authorized by ordinance.
In this section, the term "violation of this Code" does not include the failure of a county officer or county employee to
perform an official duty, unless it is provided that failure to perform the duty is to be punished as provided in this section
or it is clear from the context that it is the intent to impose the penalty provided for in this section upon the officer or
employee.
Except as otherwise provided:
A person convicted of a violation of this Code shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00 or imprisonment
for a term not exceeding 60 days or any combination.
In those cases where the magistrate court has jurisdiction to try cases involving the violation of state law, the court

With respect to violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time, each day the violation continues is a
separate offense.
With respect to violations of this Code that are not continuous with respect to time, each day the violation continues
is a separate offense.
The imposition of a penalty does not prevent revocation or suspension of a license, permit or franchise or other
administrative sanctions.
Violations of this Code that are continuous with respect to time are a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or
other equitable relief and by such other means as are provided by law. The imposition of a penalty does not prevent

court of competent jurisdiction, that unconstitutionality, invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any of the remaining phrases,
clauses, sentences, paragraphs or sections of this Code, since they would have been enacted without the incorporation in this Code of
the unconstitutional, invalid or unenforceable phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section.
Sec.	1-9.	-	Provisions	considered	as	continuations	of	existing	ordinances.
The provisions appearing in this Code, insofar as they are the same as those of ordinances and resolutions existing at the time of

FOOTNOTE(S):
--- (2) ---
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2009-01-02, adopted Jan. 6, 2009, was not specifically amendatory. At the editor's discretion, these provisions
have been included as §§ 10-61—10-83.
Sec.	10-61.	-	Findings	regarding	necessity	for	adult	entertainment.
Based on the experience of other local governmental jurisdictions recognizing that the sale and/or consumption of
alcoholic beverages in adult entertainment establishments produces increased criminal activity and deterioration of
adjacent neighborhoods, Turner County finds that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the
county to enact regulations to reduce the possible adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. However, the
county also finds that the outright prohibition of such establishments could improperly infringe upon protected forms of
expression. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to reasonably regulate adult entertainment establishments in a
manner that serves the legitimate governmental interest of reducing criminal activity and protecting property values
without unreasonably infringing upon the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and their patrons.
The county has again reviewed and considered problems that other counties have experienced as a result of adult
entertainment establishments operating within those jurisdictions. The county, in reaffirming this article, has no intention
to infringe upon the rights of any citizens to freedom of speech or expression.
The United States Supreme Court, in Young v. American Mini Theaters, Inc., 427 U.S. 50 (1976), held that adult
entertainment uses are subject to carefully tailored regulation to minimize the adverse land use impacts, and that zoning
can legitimately be utilized to regulate such uses by establishing zones where adult entertainment uses are most
compatible with other uses or the surrounding neighborhood, or by requiring minimum distances to be maintained
between adult uses and other uses.
The United States Supreme Court, in City of Renton v. Playtime Theater, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), held that a local
government may rely on the experience of other jurisdictions in enacting legislation to regulate adult entertainment uses.

The commissioners have considered and are mindful of the harmful secondary effects caused by adult entertainment uses a
discussed in numerous judicial opinions, including but not limited to the following:
Daytona Grand, Inc. v. City of Daytona Beach, Florida, 490 F.3d 860 (11th Circuit, 2007);

structures for the purpose of reducing to a minimum the erosion process and the resultant transport of sediment by wind, water, ice or
gravity.
State waters means any and all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage systems, springs, wells, and
other bodies of surface or subsurface water, natural or artificial, lying within or forming a part of the boundaries of the state which are
not entirely confined and retained completely upon the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation.
Structural erosion and sedimentation control measures means measures for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing
areas by utilizing the mechanical properties of matter for the purpose of either changing the surface of the land or storing, regulating or
disposing of runoff to prevent excessive sediment loss. Examples of structural erosion and sediment control practices are riprap,
sediment basins, dikes, level spreaders, waterways or outlets, diversions, grade stabilization structures, sediment traps and land
grading, etc. Such measures can be found in the publication "Manual For Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia."
Trout streams means all streams or portions of streams within the watershed as designated by the game and fish division of the
state department of natural resources under the provisions of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq. Streams
designated as primary trout waters are defined as water supporting a self-sustaining population of rainbow, brown or brook trout.
Streams designated as secondary trout waters are those in which there is no evidence of natural trout reproduction, but are capable of
supporting trout throughout the year. First order trout waters are streams into which no other streams flow except springs.
Vegetative erosion and sedimentation control practices means practices for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing
areas by covering the soil with:
Permanent seeding sprigging or planting, producing longterm vegetative cover;
Temporary seeding, producing shortterm vegetative cover; or
Sodding, covering areas with a turf of perennial sod-forming grass.
Such practices can be found in the publication "Manual For Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia."
Watercourse means any natural or artificial watercourse, stream, river, creek, channel, ditch, canal, conduit, culvert, drain,
waterway, gully, ravine, or wash in which water flows either continuously or intermittently and which has a definite channel, bed and
banks, and including any area adjacent thereto subject to inundation by reason of overflow or floodwater.
Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration
sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated
soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.

minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to
all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent
improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of
any land disturbing activity.
Minimum requirements/BMP's.
Best management practices as set forth in this subsection and subsection (c) of this section shall be required for all
land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall
constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with
subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of
stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f). As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and
"properly designed" mean designed to control soil erosion and sedimentation for all rainfall events up to and
including a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event.
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly
designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a
local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division
pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters
being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of
the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director.
Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land
disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction
activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such failure occurs.
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring
of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this article for the purpose of governing land
disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, best management practices, including sound conservation and
engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no
less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia," published by
the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was
permitted, as well as the following:
Stripping of vegetation, regrading, and other development activities shall be conducted in such a manner so as to
minimize erosion.
Cut and fill operations must be kept to a minimum.
Development plans must conform to topography and soil type, so as to create the lowest practicable erosion
potential.
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected, and supplemented.
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum.
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development.
Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures must be installed as soon as practicable.
To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt
traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is
stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of this article.
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the

Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property.
Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect
other property owners.
Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by the means of bridges or culverts, except when such methods are
not feasible; provided, in any case, that such crossings must be kept to a minimum.
Land disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or
control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or
preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (a) of this section.
Except as provided in subsection (c)(16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all
state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or
wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural
resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a
drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control
measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented; provided, however, that
buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq.) shall remain in force unless a
variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection (15)b. The following requirements shall apply to
any such buffer:
No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural,
undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once
the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a
protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in
sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single
family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own
occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to
protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on
the stream bed.
On or before December 31, 2000, the board shall adopt rules which contain specific criteria for the grant or
denial by the director of requests for variances. After such date, no variance shall be granted by the director
which is not consistent with the criteria contained in such rules; provided, however, that, should the board fail
to adopt rules which contain specific criteria for the grant or denial of requests for variances by the director on
or before December 31, 2000, the authority of the director to issue such variances shall be suspended until the
board adopts such rules.
There is established a 50-foot buffer, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested
by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to
O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq., except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that
small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per
minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the
terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board providing for notice to the division or
local issuing authority of the location and extent of the piping and prescribed methodology for minimizing the
impact of such piping and for measuring the volume of water discharged by the stream. Any such pipe must stop
short of the downstream landowner's property, and the landowner must comply with the buffer requirement for
any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity,
provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are
implemented. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer, and a buffer shall remain in its natural,
undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once

DIVISION	1.	-	STATUTORY	AUTHORIZATION,	FINDINGS	OF	FACT,	PURPOSE	AND	OBJECTIVES
Sec.	34-31.	-	Authorization.
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore,
the Board of Commissioners of Turner County, Georgia, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. No. 2009-08-01, 8-10-2009)
Sec.	34-32.	-	Findings	of	fact.
The flood hazard areas of Turner County, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(Ord. No. 2009-08-01, 8-10-2009)
Sec.	34-33.	-	Statement	of	purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses
due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood
damage at the time of initial construction;
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or
which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may
increase flood hazards to other lands; and
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in
the accommodation of floodwaters.
(Ord. No. 2009-08-01, 8-10-2009)
Sec.	34-34.	-	Objectives.
The objectives of this article are:
To protect human life and health;
To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer
lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a
manner as to minimize flood blight areas;
To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense
of the general public;

In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required:
New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement of the structure;
New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and
utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices
that minimize flood damage;
Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully
enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as
to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater.
Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or
meet the following minimum criteria:
Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they
permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction.
So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall
only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the
premises, or entry to the elevated area; and
The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation,
plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding;
Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring
may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in
addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces;
New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters
into the system;
New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood

sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accord
standards of section 34-91(4), "Elevated buildings."
All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation,
plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation.
Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-
30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect
shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for
meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 34-
73(6).
Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available:
All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new
and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing
manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have
the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation.
Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision may be elevated so that either:
The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the
base flood elevation; or
The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation
elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade.
All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. section 34-91(6) above.)
All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is
licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and
security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or
The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring
and elevation requirements of subsection (3)a.—c. above.
Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 34-52 are areas designated as
floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential.
In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without
increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other
development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base
flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification
thereof.

only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply.
No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the
stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a
one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of
existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less
than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated
one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been
completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in
accordance with standards of section 34-91(4), "elevated buildings."

The Greater Turner Planning Advisory Commission whose members are appointed by the governmental units of Turner Cou
hereby authorized to and shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variances from the requirements of this article.
The Greater Turner Planning Advisory Commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any
requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building official in the enforcement or administration of this
article.
The building official shall, no less than ten days prior to the date of the hearing in regard to a request for an appeal or
variance, notify in writing the Board of Commissioners of Turner County of such request, the location of the property in
question, the name of the owner(s) of the property, a synopsis of the nature of the request for any such appeal or
variance, and the date, time and location of the hearing.
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Greater Turner Planning Advisory Commission may appeal such decision to
the Superior Court of Turner County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is
the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the
criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
In reviewing such requests, the Greater Turner Planning Advisory Commission shall consider all technical evaluations,
relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article.
Conditions for variances:
A variance shall be issued only when there is:
A finding of good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the
standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a
determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of
the building.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the
base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Board of
Commissioners of Turner County in every case and to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the Greater Turner Planning Advisory
Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this article.

1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced.
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying
elevations within the floodplain.
New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced after August 3, 2009 and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes,
"new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after April 20, 1998 and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities,
the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after April 20, 1998.
North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood
modernization maps.
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is:
Built on a single chassis;
Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;
Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping,
travel, or seasonal use.
Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent
construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond
the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not
include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units
or part of the main structure. (NOTE: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank.

Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before
damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place
during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the
"start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure
prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage
occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work
performed.
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling,
floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified
by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic
structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or
improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the
repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by
this article.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management
regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance
required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

through the entire right-of-way and shall be subject to the following provisions:
Residential curb cuts: R-R, R-1, R1A, and R-20 zoning areas (excluding multifamily, residential group development
projects and manufactured housing park development):
No more than two combined entrances and exits shall be allowed any parcel of property, the front of which is

200 feet shall be permitted at the rate of one entrance/exit for each additional 100 feet.
At street intersections (corner lots), no curb cuts shall be located within 25 feet of the intersection of two
curblines or such lines extended; or within 15 feet of the intersection of two property lines (right-of-way lines)
or such lines extended, whichever is more restrictive. On principal or minor arterials or collector streets, no
driveway shall be within 70 feet of the intersection of two curblines or curblines extended.
The distance between any two curb cuts on the same side of the street shall be not less than ten feet. Said

distance shall be measured between the point of tangency of the curb return radii and the established curb.
All driveways shall be constructed so as to have at least five feet from any front property line (excluding rightof-way), except that a curb return may become tangent to a curbline at a point where such property line
extends with the curbline.
The maximum width of any driveway shall not exceed 24 feet measured at the right-of-way line.
The sum of the two curb return radii for any curb cut shall not exceed 15 feet.
When development on sites where existing curb cuts are abandoned and access is no longer afforded due to
parking lots, buildings or other permitted structures, the driveway shall be removed, the sidewalk (if existing)
shall be replaced, the curb and gutter shall be replaced, fill dirt backfilled to its natural state.
Commercial, industrial, manufactured housing park and multifamily curb cuts:
No more than two combined entrances or exits shall be allowed any parcel or frontage which is less than 300
feet on any one street. On parcels less than 150 feet, only one entrance shall be allowed provided it is a twoway driveway (two one-way driveways shall be allowed in lieu of the one two-way). Additional entrances or
exits for parcels of property having a frontage in excess of 300 feet shall be permitted at the rate of one
entrance-exit for each additional 150 feet.
No driveway shall be located closer than 150 feet of an existing driveway on an abutting lot. Existing lots of
record less than 150 feet frontage shall be allowed one combined entrance/exit not to exceed 24 feet at [the]
right-of-way line.
At street intersections (corner lots), no curb cuts shall be located within 70 feet of the intersection of two
curblines or within 60 feet of the intersection of two property lines (right-of-way lines) where such lines
extended, whichever is more restrictive.
All driveways shall be constructed so as to be at least 12.5 feet from any property line except that a curb return
may become tangent to a curbline at a point where the property line extended intersects such curbline.
Maximum width of any driveway shall not exceed 35 feet measured at the right of-way line; minimum two-way
shall be 24 feet at right-of-way line with a maximum of 12.5-foot radius. No two driveways on the same
property shall be closer than 25 feet.
The maximum width of any curb cut in RC, G-B, C-A, WLI and H-I zones shall not exceed 35 feet at the right-ofway line.
The sum of the two curb return radii for any one curb cut shall not be less than 25 feet, nor greater than 40
feet.
When development on sites where existing curb cuts are abandoned and access is no longer afforded due to
parking lots, buildings, or other permitted structures, the driveway shall be removed, the sidewalk (if existing)
shall be replaced, the curb and gutter shall be replaced, fill dirt backfilled to its natural state; where it is a piped
driveway to a dirt or paved street, said pipe shall be removed, asphalt removed and the shoulders and ditch
regraded to its natural preexisting state.
Residential group development curb cuts:
No more than one combined entrance and exit shall be allowed any parcel of property, the total area of which
is less than or equal to two acres. Additional entrances for parcels having areas greater than two acres will be
granted at the rate of one combined entrance and exit per two acres.
At street intersections (corner lots), no curb cuts shall be located within 70 feet of the intersection of two
curblines or within 60 feet of the intersection of two property lines where such lines extended, whichever is
more restrictive.
The maximum width of any driveway shall not exceed 24 feet measured at the right-of-way line.
The sum of the two curb return radii for any one curb cut shall not exceed 15 feet.

New facilities which handle hazardous materials, of the types listed in section 312 of the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act of 1976, (excluding underground storage tanks) and in amounts of 10,000 pounds or more on any one
day, shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill

Permanent stormwater infiltration basins shall not be constructed in areas having high pollution susceptibility.
Any new wastewater treatment basin shall have an impermeable liner.
10-5.	-	Wetlands	districts.
Findings of fact. The wetlands in Turner County, Georgia, are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant
development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and
nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood
control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In
addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well being of many communities within
the State of Georgia.
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling,
excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or
destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare.
Purpose. The purpose of this ordinance is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological,
economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on
upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process.
Establishment of the wetlands protection districts. The wetlands protection districts are hereby established which shall
correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of Turner County, Georgia, that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps. These maps shall be referred to as the "generalized wetlands
maps" and are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance, together with all explanatory
matter thereon and attached thereto.
The generalized wetlands maps do not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within Turner County,
Georgia, and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by
section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. No local government action under this ordinance relieves the landowner from federal
or state permitting requirements.
Requirement for local permit or permission. No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district
without written permission or a permit from Turner County, Georgia. If the area proposed for development is located
within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the zoning administrator or his designee
using the generalized wetlands maps, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps
determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be
granted until a section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued.
Permitted uses. The following uses shall be allowed as uses by right within the wetlands protection district to the extent
that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require
structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein. (The activities listed in this section are exempted

Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of
Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit.

canoeing.

Commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the zoning administrator in the enforcement of
these regulations.
Request for a variance. The board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of these
regulations as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of
provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these
regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done; provided, however, that a
variance shall not be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this resolution in the district
in question. Such variance may be granted in an individual case upon finding by the board that all of the following exists:
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question
because of its size, shape, or topography; and
The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; and
Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and
Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of
these regulations; provided that no variance may be granted for a use of land, building or structure that is
prohibited by this ordinance. Applications for use variances shall not be accepted by the zoning administrator. Such
requests shall be properly filed as requests for rezoning, the authority for such rezoning of property being solely
reserved for the Turner County commission.
Provided that the board of appeals may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards (i.e., increased
setbacks, buffer strips, screening, etc.) as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of residents and
workers in the community, and to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood. Provided, that
whenever the board of appeals shall find, in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these
regulations that any of the terms, conditions or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not being
complied with, said board shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and
granting full opportunity for public hearing.
Request for extension of nonconforming residential uses. The board may authorize upon appeal in specific cases an
extension or replacement of an existing nonconforming residential use which the board is specifically authorized to pass
on under the terms of this resolution. Said extension may be granted in an individual case upon finding by the board
that:
The use is a nonconforming use as defined in these regulations; and
The use is in full compliance with all requirements of these regulations applicable to nonconforming uses; and
The extension of said use will not further injure a permitted use on adjacent property in the same district.
This section is specifically designed to allow for the replacement of homeowner occupied residential units in areas
no longer zoned for residential uses. As such, this provision is not subject to the limits of section 8-5
In cases of physician documented medical need, the board is further authorized to permit the siting of a
manufactured home as a guest or servant's quarters to accommodate an onsite care provider. Such approval shall

use shall be made on forms provided for such purposes. All information required on said forms shall be provided by the applicant.
Forms shall be filed with the zoning administrator, and the applicant shall pay Turner County for expenses incidental to the appeal. No
form shall be accepted by the zoning administrator unless it contains all pertinent information and is accompanied by the required fee
of $100.00 to defray expenses.
SECTION	14.	-	AMENDMENT
14-1.	-	General	conditions.
These regulations, including the official zoning maps, may be amended by the board of commissioners on their own motion, on
petition of a property owner or his duly authorized agent, or on recommendation of the planning commission, but no amendment shall
become effective unless it shall have been proposed by or shall first have been submitted to the planning commission for review and
recommendation. Before enacting an amendment to these regulations, the governing authority shall give public notice and hold a public
hearing thereon as set forth in this section.
Establishment of comprehensive plan. The comprehensive plan is established as official policy of Turner County. As
such, the goals and policies of the plan, and the resultant future land use plan, shall serve as the guide under which
the unincorporated areas of the county are divided into zoning districts. The recommendations of the plan are
hereby established as official policy of the county, and shall receive due consideration in all requests as reflected in
section 14-2.7(e), standards for exercise of zoning power.
Limited use provision. The Turner County board of commissioners establish the "limited use" provision for the
purpose of allowing an applicant to request that a certain area be designated as a limited use. In some areas of the
county, a specific land use activity out of a general zoning classification may have less community impact than some
of the possibilities of use in that specific zoning district. For this reason, an applicant may request in his rezoning
petition to limit the use of a proposed property to a specified use only (for example, R-C LU-Rural commercial
district limited to a bait and tackle store.) The requested limited use must be among the uses permitted in the
zoning district classification for which the limited use is requested. Alteration or change of an approved limited use
shall be treated as any normal zoning amendment.
Special conditions limitations. An applicant may file site plans, renderings, construction specifications, written
development restrictions and other site planning or development conditions which the applicant proposes as
binding conditions upon the development and use of the property involved in the application. Should the
application be approved with these conditions, any alteration or change of a special conditions limitation shall be
treated as any normal zoning amendment.
14-2.	-	Application	for	amendment.
General. Applications for amendment of these regulations may be in the form of proposals for amendment of the text of
these regulations, proposals for amendment of the zoning maps or requests for special exception approval. Applications
for amendment shall be submitted to the zoning administrator and shall include a fee of $150.00 payable to the county,
to defray expenses. No application for a zoning change affecting the same parcel of property or part thereof shall be
accepted by the zoning administrator until the expiration of at least 12 months immediately following the defeat of the
rezoning request by the Turner County commission.
Signature of applicant required. All applications shall be signed by the applicant, and shall state his name and address.
Application for text amendment. In the case of a text amendment, the application shall set forth the new text to be added

The community or area in which is located the land proposed to be reclassified and the street number, if any, or if
none, the location with respect to the nearby public roads in common use.

staff recommendation and the recommendation of the Greater Turner County Planning Advisory Commission. The
chairman shall then allow public input. General procedures to be followed will require citizen comments to be heard
in an orderly fashion. Citizens speaking in favor of the request shall be heard first, followed by those opposed to the
issue. All speakers will be asked to provide his or her name and address for the public record. Citizens are
requested to keep their comments as brief as possible so that all who wish to be heard will have adequate time.
Where there is a large number of citizens wishing to testify at a given hearing, the presiding officer may invoke
reasonable time limitations on both the proponents and opponents of a request. In such cases, these time limits
shall apply to both sides of an issue equally, such minimum time period to be no less than ten minutes per side.
Citizens shall address their comments to the county commission as a whole. Individual attacks or cross examination
of commission members, county employees or other citizens will be ruled out of order. The commission retains the
privilege to ask any questions of staff or any citizen present for clarification. After all citizen comments have been
received, all further discussion of the specific application is reserved for the county commission. The chairman shall
then declare the public hearing closed and no further public comment will be entertained. The county commission
will then render a decision on the application. So that the purpose of this ordinance will be served, health, public
safety, and general welfare secured, the county commission may approve the application, reduce the land area for
which the application is made, change the district requested, add or delete conditions of the application, deny an
application, or defer consideration of an application to acquire additional information. An action by the commission
to defer the application shall include a statement of the date and time of the next meeting at which the application
will be considered, which statement shall constitute public notice of the hearing on the application and no further
notice, is required. In the case of tabling of a matter, no further public comment will be entertained upon further
consideration of the matter. When, in the opinion of the county commission, the official public hearing has brought
forth substantial new evidence or testimony not available to the Greater Turner County Planning Advisory
Commission at the time of their review of a zoning matter, or should the commission desire to request further study
by the planning and advisory commission of a particular aspect of an application, it shall be the policy of the
commission to table the issue and request that the planning advisory commission restudy the issue and affirm or
amend its recommendation, which action shall be reported to the county commission prior to making a final
decision. Under no circumstances will public comment be entertained by the county commission following the
closing of the public hearing.
Standards for exercise of zoning powers. In order to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of
Turner County against the unrestricted use of property, the following standards, and other factors relevant to
balancing the above stated public interests shall be considered as they apply to any application brought before the
county commission for a zoning decision:
Is the proposed zoning or use suitable in view of the zoning and development of adjacent and nearby
property?
Does the request represent the possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby
districts and will the proposed use adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property?
Will the proposed use cause an excessive or burdensome use of public facilities or services including, but not
limited to, streets, schools, water, sewer, or other public utilities, including police and fire protection?
Is the proposed use supported by new or changing conditions not anticipated by the comprehensive plan or is
the proposed use compatible and consistent with the purpose and intent of the comprehensive plan?
Will the proposed change adversely influence existing conditions in the neighborhood or the county at large
and are there substantial reasons why the property cannot or should not be used as currently zoned?
Are there potential adverse impacts on the environment including, but not limited to, drainage, soil erosion
and sedimentation, flooding, air quality, and water quality and quantity?
Are the costs required of the public in providing, improving, increasing or maintaining public utilities, schools,
streets and public safety necessities reasonable when considering the proposed changes?
Will the proposed change be detrimental to the value or improvement of development of adjacent or nearby

property in accordance with existing requirements and development standards?
Is the proposed change out of scale with the needs of the neighborhood or Turner County or does the request
reflect a reasonable balance between the promotion of the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare
and the right to unrestricted use of property?
Will the proposed change constitute a grant of special privilege to the individual owner as contrasted with the
adjacent or nearby neighborhood or with the general public?
Standards for special exception review. In addition to the standards enumerated in subsection 14-2.8e above, the
following additional standards shall be considered for special exception requests:
Is the type of street providing access to the use adequate to serve the proposed special exception use?
Is access into and out of the property adequate to provide for traffic and pedestrian safety, the anticipated
volume of traffic flow, and to allow access by emergency vehicles?
Are public facilities such as schools, water, sewer or other public utilities and police and fire protection
adequate to serve the proposed special exception use?
Are refuse, service parking and loading areas on the property located or screened to protect other properties
in the area from such adverse effects as noise, light glare and other negative impacts?
Will the hours and manner of operation of the special exception use have no adverse impacts on other
properties in the area?
Will the height, size or location of the buildings or other structures on the property be compatible with the
height, size or location of buildings or other structures on neighboring properties?
Provided, that the county commission may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards as
may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community, and to protect
the value and use of property in the general neighborhood; and provided that wherever the county
commission shall find in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations that
any term, condition or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not being complied with, said
county commission shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and
granting full opportunity for a public hearing.
Special exceptions granted by the county commission shall be valid for a period of 12 months from date of
approval, shall not be transferable except upon written approval of the county commission, shall be executed
within the granted period or become null and void and subject to procedures for resubmission as hereinabove
established.
Public hearings records standards. The county clerk shall mechanically record the proceedings of all zoning public
hearings. If requested by any party, verbatim transcripts of the public hearing can be prepared, but only if
requested and purchased in advance by the requesting party, who must arrange at his expense for a certified court
reporter to record and transcribe the hearing and furnish the original of the transcript to the commission for its
records. The record of the public hearing and all evidence (e.g., maps, drawings, traffic studies, etc.) submitted at
the public hearing shall be noted as such and shall become a permanent part of the particular zoning amendment's
file.
Conflict of interest and disclosure rules. Any Turner County commissioner or planning commission member shall
refrain from discussion of or voting upon any matter where the following exist:
Has any direct ownership in any real property to be affected by a rezoning action under consideration by
Turner County government;
Has a ten percent or more direct ownership interest in the total assets or capital stock in any business entity
which has any direct ownership in any real property affected by a rezoning action under consideration by
Turner County government; or
Has a spouse, parent, sibling or child with any interest as described in [the] previous 14-2.8e.1 and 2, shall
disclose the nature and extent of such interest, in writing, to the Turner County commission as soon as he or

she knows of its existence. Such an official, which shall include members of the county commission, or
planning advisory commission also shall disqualify himself/herself from voting on the rezoning action and shall
not take any other action on behalf of himself or herself or anyone else to influence action on the rezoning
action. Any written disclosures made pursuant to this section which result in the inability of the county
commission to obtain a quorum for the purpose of making a final decision when considering a rezoning action,
the county commission shall initiate the special master process set forth in O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-5. Moreover,
questions of interpretation as to the application of this statute should be resolved by reference to the Georgia

(Res. No. 2005-03-01, 3-10-2005)
Sec.	4-1.	-	Preliminary	plat.
Purpose. The purpose of the preliminary plat is to safeguard the subdivider from unnecessary loss of time and expense
in preparation of a subdivision plat which does not conform with the specifications of the subdivision ordinance. The
preliminary plat requires only approximate accuracy of scale and dimension. Public agencies having jurisdiction will
review preliminary plats regarding matters within their jurisdiction. During the review process, the subdivider or his agent
may be called upon for consultation.
Subdivisions requiring no new street, water, or sewer facilities. All subdivisions which do not involve the platting,

construction, or opening of new streets, water or sewer facilities may be accepted by the Turner County zoning
administrator in the form of a final plat, provided that essential data required by the reviewing agencies to insure
compliance with the intent of this ordinance is submitted.
Filing. Any person desiring to subdivide land shall file with the Turner County zoning administrator five copies of the
preliminary plat accompanied by a letter of application. The letter of application will describe the proposed subdivision at
length and will also state for what purposes easements may be utilized for such as water, streets, power or
telecommunications maintenance. There will not be any restrictions on the use of easements. The letter of application
shall contain the name and address of the developer(s) and his agent(s), the zoning of the property to be subdivided,
whether or not the subdivision will be developed in phases, plans for annexation, and plans for serving the proposed
subdivision with sewer and water facilities. The plat shall be prepared in accordance with this ordinance and with
applicable county specifications by a registered land surveyor, who is licensed under the laws of the State of Georgia. The
preliminary plat shall be deemed filed with the planning commission when it is filed with the Turner County zoning
administrator. At the time of filing, a certificate of filing shall be provided to the subdivider and shall include the time and
date of filing. The zoning administrator shall have authority to reject the preliminary plat if they find it does not comply
with this ordinance. If rejected, the zoning administrator shall provide the subdivider with a written statement specifying
all the respects in which the plat fails to comply. The subdivider may appeal to the planning advisory commission from
such rejection. Filing of the preliminary plat shall be accomplished at least 30 days prior to the regular planning advisory
commission meeting at which it is to be considered. The preliminary plat shall include:
Title block and north arrow: The plat will show the name of the proposed subdivision, its location, the name,
address and registration number of the surveyor preparing the plat and the date of the plat. A north arrow shall be

per designated zoning classification requirements shall be calculated upland of any wetlands boundaries within or
contiguous to the project.
Completeness. If any of the above required information is omitted or misrepresented on the plat, the Turner County
zoning administrator may refuse to review the plat, and shall return the plat to the subdivider to be completed or revised.
Approval by individual agencies. No preliminary plat shall be approved by the planning advisory commission unless it is
approved by the staff development review committee. Said agencies shall, with or without modification, approve or
disapprove the preliminary plat to the extent that each has jurisdiction. If the plat is rejected, the respective reviewing
agency shall provide the planning advisory commission with a written statement specifying all aspects where the plat fails
to comply.
Staff development review committee. Upon receipt of the filing of the preliminary plat, the zoning administrator shall
prepare those materials for presentation to the staff development review committee. The staff development review
committee shall review the preliminary plat for technical compliance with the Turner County land subdivision ordinance,
zoning ordinance, comprehensive plan, and other county ordinances that might impact the proposed land subdivision.
The staff development review committee shall recommend in writing approval, conditional approval, postponement or
disapproval within 30 days of submission.
Coordination. It shall be the responsibility of the zoning administrator to ensure that the respective reviews of the staff
development review committee are brought together in a timely fashion for proper presentation to the planning advisory
commission.
Review by planning advisory commission. The planning advisory commission shall review the preliminary plat, giving due
consideration to the review of the staff development review committee. The planning advisory commission shall then
recommend to the Turner County board of commissioners for preliminary approval, conditional approval, postponement
or disapproval within 30 days of submission. The subdivider may waive in writing this requirement and consent to an
extension of such period.
Preliminary approval means that the developer is now authorized to proceed with the preparation of the required
improvement plans, outlined in detail under section 4-2. No developer shall proceed with any construction or any
other work in the proposed subdivision before obtaining preliminary approval of these improvement plans in
writing. Lots shall not be sold nor shall building construction begin at this time. Preliminary approval grants the
developer a maximum time of 18 months within which he shall submit his improvements plan and final plat for
approval unless a time extension is granted by the planning advisory commission before the expiration of the 18-
month period. If such time extension is granted, it shall be for not more than 12 additional months. Failure to
submit improvement plans and final plat within this time period, including extension if any, shall invalidate
preliminary plat approval, and require resubmission of preliminary plat. Additionally, if, in the opinion of the staff
development review committee, substantial changes have been made to the approved preliminary plat, the revised
plat shall be resubmitted as a new preliminary plat.
Conditional approval means the developer may proceed after written notice from the zoning administrator, as
outlined under "preliminary approval" but only after he has submitted at least five copies of the corrected
preliminary plan to the zoning administrator, noting thereon the condition or changes required by the approval of
the planning advisory commission.
Postponement means action is delayed for specific reasons which shall be noted and transmitted in writing to the
developer by the zoning administrator. Postponed preliminary plans may be reconsidered by the planning advisory
commission without resubmittal to the staff development review committee and the Turner County health
department.
Disapproval means denial of the application for subdivision because the developer's plans are not in compliance
with this ordinance. For further consideration, the developer must rework and resubmit his plans as though they
were a completely new preliminary plan. The specific reasons for disapproval shall be stated to allow for correction.

General requirements. Subdivision plats receive their second official consideration as "improvement plans." These plans sha
approved by the county engineer who shall certify that the improvement plans are in conformance with this ordinance, offic
specifications, and with the requirements of the approved preliminary plan. No developer shall proceed with any constructio
the proposed subdivision before obtaining this approval. This process of improvement plans approval is between the county
and the developer, and is not subject to planning advisory commission review and approval.
Professional engineer consultant (if applicable) required. Should certain design calculations be required to resolve flow
problems, possible erosion or drainage problems, or other detailed design problems which might be encountered in the
process of preparing the required improvement plan, the county engineer shall be authorized to require the services of a
professional engineer or consultant in the improvement plan design process. Should such services be required, such
plans shall reflect the engineer or consultant's state registration. All professional surveying, engineering or consultant
service costs shall be the sole responsibility of the applicant.
Filing. To secure formal review of his improvement plans, the developer shall file with the zoning administrator three
certified white background prints of the improvement plans (signed and sealed by the developer's registered consultant)
white background prints of the improvement plans. The zoning administrator will then distribute the improvements plan
to the staff development review committee which shall jointly review the proposed improvement plans and shall approve
or deny the proposed improvement plans. The zoning administrator shall notify the planning advisory commission of the
committee's action, in writing.
Approval means the developer is now authorized to proceed with the physical improvements in the subdivision,
after securing any required construction permits, and may proceed with the preparation of the final subdivision
plat.
Conditional approval means the developer may proceed as outlined in the preceding paragraph, but only after he
submits three certified copies of the corrected improvement plans to the county engineer for his review and
approval.
Denial means disapproval of the improvement plans. For further consideration, the developer must rework his
plans to conform to the requirements of this ordinance, and then submit the reworked plans to the zoning
administrator as though they were a completely new set of plans.
Plans and data required for improvement plan submission. The plans for the required public improvements shall be
prepared for the approval by the staff development review committee prior to the construction and only after approval
of the preliminary plat. Such improvement plans shall show the proposed locations, sizes, types, grades and general
design features of each facility, and shall be based on reliable field data. Improvement plan approvals are good for 24
months. If the subdivision is sold prior to completion and final platting, a mandatory review by the staff development
review committee shall be required. Failure to comply may result in revocation of construction permit after notice and
hearing before the planning advisory commission. The developer shall receive a minimum of ten days' written notice of
said hearing. The improvement construction drawing shall be submitted on white background prints. The sheet size shall
be 24 inches by 36 inches unless another size is approved by the county engineer. The drawing shall include the following
information:
Construction plans. The developer shall provide the plan and profile of each proposed street (indicating the existing
ground surface elevation and proposed street grade surface elevation including extensions, except where street
