PREFACE 
</p>
        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Baldwin County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances and resolutions adopted through June 17, 2008, by the board of county commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Index 
                  The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments

               Sec. 1. - Created. 
               (a)	(1)	There is created a five-member board of commissioners of Baldwin County who shall administer the affairs of the county. For purposes of electing members of the board of commissioners, Baldwin County is divided into five commissioner districts. The five commissioner districts shall be and correspond to those five numbered districts described in and attached to and made a part of this Act and further identified as Plan Name: baldwinwk2 Plan Type: Local User: Tara Administrator: Baldwin Co. 
               (2)	When used in such attachment, the terms "tract" and "BG" (block group) shall mean and describe the same geographical boundaries as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. The separate numeric designations in a Tract description which are underneath a "BG" heading shall mean and describe individual Blocks within a block group as provided in the report of the Bureau of the Census for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Any part of Baldwin County which is not included in any such district described in that attachment shall be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Any part of Baldwin County which is described in that attachment as being in a particular district shall nevertheless not be included within such district if such part is not contiguous to such district. Such noncontiguous part shall instead be included within that district contiguous to such part which contains the least population according to the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. Except as otherwise provided in the description of any commissioner district, whenever the description of such district refers to a named city, it shall mean the geographical boundaries of that city as shown on the census map for the United States decennial census of 2000 for the State of Georgia. 
               (3)	Commissioner Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, as they exist immediately prior to June 1, 2002, shall continue to be designated as Commissioner Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, but as newly described under this Act, and on and after June 1, 2002, such members of the board serving from those former commissioner districts shall be deemed to be serving from and representing their respective districts as newly described under this Act.

                  Having engaged in a factual investigation with respect to live human nudity and the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, the board of commissioners, finds that: 
                  (1)	The experience of other areas, including but not limited to, the City of Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Los Angeles, California, demonstrate that the notorious conditions attaching to the commercial exploitation of live human nudity do not vary greatly by geographic location. 
                  (2)	Recent developments in the county indicate that our county shares the experiences of other areas for which comprehensive statistical studies have been performed. 
                  (3)	Live public human nudity (either partial or total), particularly in conjunction with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages tends to beget criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. 
                  (4)	Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with commercial live human nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution and other sex offenses, and drug offenses. 
                  (5)	Among the undesirable community conditions identified with commercial live human nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditures for the allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burdens on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior, a decrease in the desirability of such areas for residential use, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. 
                  (6)	Evidence drawn from personal experiences of Baldwin County law enforcement officers indicate similar types of criminal behavior associated with these establishments which is of concern to the governing authority. 
                  (7)	It is in the best interest of the public health, safety, and welfare to reduce the adverse impacts of live commercial human nudity associated with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages by redefining those portions of the county ordinances relating to these concerns.

                  (1)	Repeatedly runs at large; 
                  (2)	Damages the property of anyone other than the owner;

                  Sec. 14-37. - Disposition of impounded animals. 
                  (a)	Except as provided in section 14-41, any dog or cat seized and impounded by the animal control unit pursuant to this article shall be detained at the animal control unit, provided that any dog or cat that is suffering from an infectious or contagious disease shall be impounded elsewhere or destroyed. Animals which are seriously injured or incurably ill may be destroyed immediately if the animal control officer determines that this is necessary to avoid significant pain and suffering. If an animal, which would otherwise be impounded, is feral or cannot be impounded without endangering the animal control officer, the employees of the animal control unit or other animals, the animal control officer shall be authorized to have the animal destroyed. 
                  (b)	If the owner of an impounded animal is known or can be reasonably ascertained, the officers of the animal control department shall notify the owner of the animal by mail, by telephone, or in person, that the animal has been impounded. The owner of any animal impounded may at any time within five weekdays after notification reclaim the animal by payment of an impoundment fee of $50.00 and the cost of rabies vaccination if the animal is not current with its vaccination. These fees, as applicable, shall also apply to biting animals held for rabies observation at the animal control department. After the expiration of five weekdays from notification to the animal's owner, an impounded animal shall become the property of the county. The disposition of vicious animals shall be as provided by state law, O.C.G.A. § 4-8-20 et seq.

The court, upon a finding of guilty or plea of guilty, may provide for forfeiture of the animals to the county or their return to their owner. 
                  (c)	The five weekdays of impoundment shall not be mandatory if the owner transfers ownership of the animal to the county. In such cases the animal, in the discretion of the animal control officer, may be impounded for such period as he or she deems appropriate; or in the discretion of the animal control officer, the animal may at any time be euthanized or offered for adoption.

                  After a dog or cat becomes the property of the county, the animal control unit may offer the animal for adoption provided that the person adopting the dog or cat pay the costs provided in this article and pays the cost of rabies vaccination, if applicable. The animal control officer may, in his sole discretion, waive the costs and fees required in this article; provided, however, that the costs for mandatory rabies vaccination and spay/neuter may not be waived.

                  If a dog or cat is not claimed by the owner within five weekdays of notice to the owner, or if a dog or cat whose owner is not known has not been adopted after five weekdays of being impounded, then the animal control unit may dispose of the animal in the manner prescribed by state law at the time of disposition. The animal control officer may, in his sole discretion, extend the time for which an animal is retained at the shelter. Disposition is not mandatory. Animal control officers shall not perform euthanasia unless they are properly certified by the state to do so. Animals shall be euthanized only in the manner prescribed by state law and regulations.

                  (a)	The animal control officer or law enforcement officer may, in his discretion, choose not to impound a dog or other animal found in violation of any section of this article but may return the animal to its owner or possessor and issue or cause to be issued a summons directed to the owner or possessor of the animal to appear before the magistrates court of the county on a date certain to stand trial for violation of this article. 
                  (b)	Upon consideration of the offense involved, the officer may, in his discretion, establish a bond in the amount of $50.00 to be paid prior to the date scheduled for hearing before the magistrate judge and the officer may recommend the forfeiture of the bond in the nature of a fine to said judge in lieu of appearance by the owner. In the event that the court declines the recommendation, then the owner shall be notified by the officer to appear at the next scheduled court to answer the charges.

Injured animals with tags may be euthanized when seriously injured after an attempt has been made to contact the owner which is reasonable under the circumstances.

If such violation of this article has not been witnessed by an officer, a subpoena shall be issued to the person making the complaint, to be and appear on the day and time set to testify on behalf of the county.

                  (Ord. of 12-3-2002, § 2) 
                  Sec. 18-93. - Duty of owners; public officer designated; enforcement. 
                  (a)	It is the duty of the owner of every dwelling, building, structure, or property within the unincorporated limits of the county to construct and maintain their dwellings, buildings, structures, and/or property in conformance with applicable codes in force within the jurisdiction, or such ordinances which regulate and prohibit activities on property and which declare it to be a public nuisance to construct or maintain any dwelling, building, structure, or property in violation of such codes or ordinances. 
                  (b)	The administrator under the county land use code is the public officer designated and appointed to exercise the powers prescribed by this article, also known herein as "public officer.". 
                  (c)	If the public officer may determine, under existing ordinances or codes that a dwelling, building or structure is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use, or otherwise finds conditions more fully set out in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-10, then the public officer may exercise all of the powers set out in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-11, and in O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(e), all for the purpose of having such citations issued and action taken for the purpose of having such unfit structures repaired, closed or demolished, with these actions to be taken prior to, in lieu of, or in addition to, the complaint in rem provided for herein. In addition, whenever such action is determined necessary by the public officer, or when a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of the unincorporated area of the county charging that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property. If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the owner and parties in interest in such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the owner and parties in interest; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the owner and parties in interest that a hearing will be held before a court of competent jurisdiction as determined by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5, at a date and time certain and at a place within the county. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the proper court. The owner and parties in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing. 
                  (d)	If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  (1)	If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)	If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this article, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a state appraiser classification as provided in Chapter 39A of Title 43 of the Official Code of Georgia(O.C.G.A. 43-39A-1 et seq.), qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the county. 
                  (e)	If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (f)	If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity for public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the county are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials; and the amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (g)	The lien provided for in subsection (f) of this section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the Office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Baldwin County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(g) which is hereinafter incorporated herein and made a part hereof. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. title 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the county. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  (h)	The board of commissioners, through its public officer or its county manager, may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (i)	Service of the complaints and orders provided for herein upon owners and parties in interest shall be in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12. 
                  (j)	Review of the court order shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

Failure of submission of such books or records within 30 days shall be grounds for revocation of the tax registration currently existing to do business in the county. Adequate records shall be kept in the county, for examination by the code enforcement officer at his discretion. If, after examination of the books or records, it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of underreporting, a penalty of 125 percent of the prime interest rate times the amount deficient will be assessed for the period delinquent.

                  In addition to the other remedies provided in this article for the collection of the occupation tax levied, the county code enforcement officer, upon any tax or installment of the tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, shall issue execution for the correct amount of the tax against the persons, partnership or corporation liable for the tax, which execution shall bear interest at the rate then provided by law on civil judgments on which executions are issued. This interest shall run from the date when such tax or installment becomes delinquent, and the lien shall cover the property in the county (both incorporated and unincorporated sections of the county) of the person liable for the tax, all as provided by the ordinances and legislation establishing the county and the laws of the state. The lien of the occupation tax shall become fixed on and date from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the code enforcement officer of the county upon the property of the defendant located in the county, and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of the execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as are provided by ordinances and charter of the county and the laws of the state, and the defendant in the execution shall have rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the charter of the county and the laws of Georgia in regard to tax executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the code enforcement officer against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of the nulla bona. If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issued pays the tax in full together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him as though he had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

The amendment may increase or lower the amounts and tax rates of any occupation and may change the classification thereof. The payment of any occupation tax provided for shall not be construed as prohibiting the levy or collection by the county of additional occupation taxes upon the same person, property or business.

                  (k)	Expiration. An operational permit shall remain in effect until reissued, renewed, or revoked or for such a period of time as specified in the permit. Construction permits shall automatically become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within 180 calendar days after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 180 calendar days after the time the work is commenced.

                  Land disturbing activity means any grading, scraping, excavating, or filling of land; clearing of vegetation; and any construction, rebuilding, or alteration of a structure. Land disturbing activity shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, individual home gardens, yard and grounds upkeep, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single-family dwelling, and the cutting of firewood for personal use. 
                  Large water supply watershed means a watershed containing 100 square miles or more of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally-owned public drinking water supply intake. 
                  Natural vegetative buffer and buffer area mean a river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin, "the Natural Environments of Georgia." Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species.

                  River bank means the rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
                  River corridor means all the land, inclusive of islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-440—12-5-457, or the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act (O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-280—12-5-293), in areas of a protected river and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. The 100-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the upper most part of the river banks, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured 100-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by the local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the river corridor protection district. Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering river bank erosion and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purposes of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for the county comprehensive plan. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the review period will be shown by revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next comprehensive plan review by the department of community affairs. 
                  Sensitive natural area means any area, as identified now or hereafter by the department of natural resources, which contains one or more of the following:

                  Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
                  Sec. 30-74. - Groundwater recharge area protection district. 
                  (a)	Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides and herbicides sprayed on crops and animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
                  (b)	Purpose. The purpose of this district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures. 
                  (c)	District delineation. The groundwater recharge area protection district is delineated according to the state department of natural resources' Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition). Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Such maps are hereby adopted and made a part of this article. 
                  (d)	Permitted uses. All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts are permitted in the groundwater recharge area protection district. The following are additional requirements for specific uses: 
                  (1)	New aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
                  (2)	New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within: 
                  a.	A high pollution susceptibility area; 
                  b.	A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15 acre-feet in size; and 
                  c.	Low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 acre-feet in size. 
                  As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 x 10 -7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the national resource and conservation service. 
                  (3)	New homes served by septic tank/drain field systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified on Table MT-1 of the Department of Human Resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereafter DHR Table MT-1). The minimum set forth in Table MT-1 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in sections A—F) of the DHR manual: 
                  a.	Based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area, 150 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated; 
                  b.	Based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area, 125 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated; and 
                  c.	Based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area, 110 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated. 
                  (4)	New manufactured home parks served by septic tank/drain field systems shall have lots or spaces having the following size limitation as identified on DHR Table MT-2 of the Department of Human Resources' (DHR) Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereafter DHR Table MT-2). The minimums set forth in Table MT-2 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in sections A—F) of the DHR manual. 
                  a.	Based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area, 150 percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated; 
                  b.	Based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area, 125 percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated; and 
                  c.	Based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area, 110 percent of the subdivision minimum lot size or space size calculated. 
                  (5)	No construction may proceed on a building or manufactured home to be served by a septic tank unless the county health department first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the DHR manual and subsections (d)(3) and (4) of this section. 
                  (6)	New facilities which handle hazardous materials, of the types (listed in Section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, excluding underground storage tanks) and in amounts 10,000 pounds or more on any one day shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements and any local fire prevention code requirements. 
                  (7)	Permanent stormwater infiltration basins shall not be constructed in areas having high pollution susceptibility.

                  (e)	Exemptions. Any lot of record approved prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived is exempt from the minimum lot size requirements contained in subsection (d)(3) and (4) of this section. 
                  (Ord. of 10-16-2001, § 4) 
                  Sec. 30-75. - Wetlands protection district. 
                  (a)	Findings of fact. The wetlands within the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constrains due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; natural resource education; scientific study, and recreational opportunities. 
                  (b)	Purpose. The purpose of this district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas. 
                  (c)	District delineation. 
                  (1)	The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the county, that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon as attached thereto. 
                  (2)	The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the county and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
                  (d)	Wetland development permit requirements. No regulated activity or use except those identified in subsection (e) of this section shall be allowed within the wetlands protection district without a development permit from the county. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary as determined by the zoning enforcement officer using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the development permit will not be granted until Section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued. 
                  (e)	Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted by right within the wetlands protection district to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging as provided herein. (These activities listed in this section are exempted from section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 Permit. However, under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances.) 
                  (1)	Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
                  (2)	Conservation or preservation soil, water, vegetation, fish or other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
                  (3)	Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
                  (4)	The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
                  (5)	The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed, and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
                  (6)	Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
                  (f)	Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited in a wetlands protection district: 
                  (1)	Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants. 
                  (2)	Hazardous or sanitary landfills. 
                  (Ord. of 10-16-2001, § 5) 
                  Sec. 30-76. - Water supply watershed protection district. 
                  (a)	Purpose. 
                  (1)	In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the county and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
                  (2)	The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the county. 
                  (b)	Establishment of water supply watershed protection districts. The Oconee Water Supply Watershed Districts are hereby designated and shall comprise the land that drains to the city of water supply intakes. The boundaries of these overlays are defined by the ridgelines of the respective watersheds and the boundary of a radius of seven miles upstream of the respective public water supply intakes. These overlays shall be further delineated and defined on the water supply watershed protection district overlay map of the county. The map is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this article by reference. The following water supply watershed districts are hereby defined, and the boundaries shall be identified on the water supply watershed protection district map: The Oconee Watershed is a large water supply watershed. The intakes for the city are located on this river. This water supply watershed does not contain a reservoir. 
                  (c)	Protection criteria. The following regulations shall apply to the Oconee Water Supply Watershed identified on the adopted map as a large water supply watershed without a reservoir: New facilities, located within seven miles of a water supply intake or water supply reservoir, which handle hazardous materials of the types listed in Section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (excluding underground storage tanks) and in amounts of 10,000 pounds or more on any one day, shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements or the requirements of the Standard Fire Prevention Code. 
                  (d)	Exemptions. The following uses shall be exempted: 
                  (1)	Land uses existing prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
                  (2)	Mining activities permitted by the department of natural resources under the Surface Mining Act. 
                  (3)	Utilities from the stream corridor buffer and setback area provisions in accordance with the following conditions if the utilities to be located in the buffer or setback areas cannot feasibly be located outside these areas: 
                  a.	The utilities shall be located as far from the stream bank as reasonably possible. 
                  b.	The installation and maintenance of the utilities shall be such to protect the integrity of the buffer and setback areas as best as reasonably possible. 
                  c.	The utilities shall not impair the quality of the drinking water stream. 
                  (4)	Specific forestry and agricultural activities in the stream corridor buffer and setback areas in accordance with the following conditions: 
                  a.	The activity shall be consistent with best management practices established by the state forestry commission or the state department of agriculture. 
                  b.	The activity shall not impair the quality of the drinking water stream. 
                  (Ord. of 10-16-2001, § 6) 
                  Sec. 30-77. - River corridor protection district. 
                  (a)	Purpose. 
                  (1)	River corridors are the strips of land that flank major rivers in the state. These corridors are of vital importance to the state in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors also allow the free movement of wildlife from area to area within the state, help control erosion and river sedimentation, and help absorb floodwaters. 
                  (2)	The Oconee River has been designated as a protected river by the state. The purpose of this article is to establish measures to guide future growth and development in the areas adjacent to the Oconee River. 
                  (b)	Establishment of Oconee River corridor protection district. The Oconee River corridor protection district is hereby designated and shall comprise all land, inclusive of islands, in areas of the Oconee River within the county and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. Also included is the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river although this strip of land is not included as part of the 100-foot buffer requirement contained in the minimum standards. This district shall be further defined and delineated on the Oconee River corridor protection district map. The map is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this article by reference. 
                  (c)	Protection criteria. 
                  (1)	Construction within the buffer area is prohibited except as provided in this article. 
                  (2)	A natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained at all times in the river corridor, except as otherwise provided in this article. 
                  (3)	The natural vegetative buffer shall be restored as quickly as possible following any land disturbing activity. 
                  (4)	Septic tank and septic tank drainfields are prohibited in the river corridor, except as expressly provided in subsection (c)(5) of this section. 
                  (5)	Single-family dwellings including the usual appurtenances are permitted in the buffer area subject to the following conditions: 
                  a.	The dwelling shall be in compliance with all local zoning regulations. 
                  b.	The dwelling shall be located on a tract of land containing at least two acres. For the purposes of these standards, the size of the tract of land shall not include any area that lies within the protected river, (that is, for tracts of land that include portions of a protected river, the area between the river banks cannot be counted towards the two-acre minimum size). 
                  c.	There shall be only one such dwelling on each two-acre or larger tract of land. 
                  d.	A septic tank or tanks serving such a dwelling may be located within the buffer area. 
                  e.	Septic tank drainfields shall not be located within the buffer area. 
                  (6)	Industrial and commercial land uses existing in the river corridor prior to the promulgation of this article are exempt from the criteria contained herein, provided that: 
                  a.	These uses do not impair the drinking quality of the river water. 
                  b.	These uses meet all state and federal environmental rules and regulations. 
                  (7)	The construction of road crossings and utility crossings is permitted in the river corridor, provided such construction meets all requirements of the Erosion and Sedimentation Control Act of 1975, and all applicable local ordinances on soil erosion and sedimentation control. 
                  (8)	The following uses are permitted in the river corridor, provided that such uses do not impair the longterm functions of the protected river or the river corridor: 
                  a.	Timber production and harvesting, subject to the following conditions: 
                  1.	Forestry activity shall be consistent with best management practices established by the state forestry commission; and 
                  2.	Forestry activity shall not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the Federal Clean Water Act, as amended. 
                  b.	Wildlife and fisheries management activities consistent with the purposes of O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8. 
                  c.	Wastewater treatment. 
                  d.	Recreational usage consistent either with the maintenance of a natural vegetative buffer or with river-dependent recreation. For example, a boat ramp would be consistent with this criterion but a hard-surface tennis court would not. Parking lots are not consistent with this criterion. Paths and walkways within the river corridor are consistent with this criterion. 
                  e.	Natural water quality treatment or purification. 
                  f.	Agricultural production and management, subject to the following conditions: 
                  1.	Agricultural activity shall be consistent with best management practices established by the state soil and water conservation commission; 
                  2.	Agricultural activity shall not impair the drinking quality of the river water as defined by the federal Clean Water Act, as amended; and 
                  3.	Agricultural activity shall be consistent with all state and federal laws, and all regulations promulgated by the state department of agriculture.

                  Sec. 42-1. - Driveway policy. 
                  As of May 15, 2001, the county road department will no longer install residential driveways. All future driveways that are installed, or any other encroachments on county right-of-way must be permitted by the county. Encroachments are defined as: 
                  (1)	Any grading, planting of trees or scrubs; 
                  (2)	Concrete mailboxes, concrete or masonry walls or structures; 
                  (3)	Anything other than the planting of grass or the installation of standard mailboxes as approved by U.S. postal regulations placed on county right-of-way. 
                  Any driveways or encroachments not permitted will be declared illegal and removed at the owner's expense. All encroachments such as masonry mailboxes and walls that existed prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived cannot be repaired or replaced without a permit. Such structure shall be removed from a county right-of-way. Applications will be available in the commissioner's office. All permits must be approved before any work is performed. No maintenance or repairs shall be performed by county forces on any new driveways that existed prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived. Maintenance may only be performed that is necessary to maintain drainage ditches, shoulders or roads.

                  The purpose of this article is to provide procedures, rules and regulations governing persons who encroach upon county rights-of-way for the purpose of installing and/or maintaining utility lines on, under, over or upon county rights-of-way and to provide for the issuance of permits for that purpose to protect the citizens and the environment and to ensure the public's safety.

The adoption and incorporation of the DOT regulations in this article specifically includes the general provisions in regard thereto confirming that the issuing of a permit is a revocable license and providing for the full indemnity of the county by the licensee.

                  2.	Owner may pave to county specifications that portion of his property serviced by said roadway and extending from said property to an existing county paved roadway; or as an alternate to said paving may pay to county the following: 
                  i.	$5.00 per running foot for his property abutting said roadway, but not less than $1,00.00 per lot for each lot in the subdivision; and 
                  ii.	$2.00 per running foot extending from said subdivision to an existing paved county roadway, not to exceed 50% of the amount determined at i. above. 
                  (Amd. of 8-21-2007) 
                  4.9.4	Conformance to adopted major thoroughfare and other plans. All streets and other features of the major thoroughfare plan of the Milledgeville Urban Area shall be platted by the subdivider in the location and to the dimension indicated on the major street plan adopted by the city, county or planning commission. 
                  When features of other plans adopted by the city, county or planning commission (such as schools or other public building sites, parks or other land for public uses) are located in whole or part in a land subdivision, such features shall be either dedicated or reserved by the subdivider for acquisition within a reasonable time by the appropriate agency. 
                  Whenever a plat proposes the dedication of land to public use that the administrator finds not required or suitable for such public use, the administrator shall refuse to approve the plat, and shall notify the governing body of the reasons for such action. 
                  4.9.5	Large scale and/or nonconventional developments. The requirements of this ordinance may be modified in the case of planned unit developments, condominiums, zero-lot line developments, and large-scale community or neighborhood units, such as apartment or housing projects or shopping centers which are not subdivided into customary lots, blocks, and streets, if the development is approved by the administrator and if it is in conformity with the purpose and intent of this ordinance. Such developments must, at a minimum, comply with the following requirements: 
                  a)	Developments shall not be less than five (5) acres in size, unless they are an extension of an existing development previously qualified under this provision. 
                  b)	Maximum density of development shall be five (5) dwelling units per gross acre, subject to a maximum increase to not more than seven (7) dwelling units per gross acre, if the development qualifies for up to two additional "bonus" dwelling units as provided in paragraph m. herein. 
                  c)	Developments with more than ten (10) units shall be connected to community/public water and sewer service and shall require the establishment of a property owners' association or condominium owners' association that will own and maintain all common areas, buffer areas, greenways and common amenities and shall provide for mandatory assessments sufficient for such purposes; 
                  d)	Not less than 50 percent of the area of the development shall be devoted to open space and not less than 30 percent of the development shall be devoted to green space. Open space is all area not covered by paving or improvements; provided however that recreational facilities such as tennis courts, swimming pools, pavilions, picnic areas and the like that are owned by the property owners' association and available for use by all residents, subject only to such reasonable rules and regulations promulgated by the association, may be included as part of the open space. The green space may be used for playing fields and walking trails available to all residents, and as part of the buffer spaces required herein. Properties that adjoin the open waters of Lake Sinclair may include a 50 foot wide strip along their straight line lake frontage as part of their open space requirement. Straight line lake frontage is defined as either the straight line chord distance of the lake frontage or by straight line perpendicular to the side property lines of the property, whichever is less. The meanderings of the 340 foot contour line will not be considered as the lake frontage distance for this purpose. Property is considered as adjoining the open waters of Lake Sinclair only if, and only to the extent, that no other land is located within 250 feet of line drawn perpendicular to the line used as the lake frontage width of the property. 
                  e)	Buildings shall not exceed three stories in height and shall not exceed two stories in height if within 75 feet of the property line of a single family conventional residence, with all buildings greater than two stories to have commercial elevators to service all units above the ground floor. 
                  f)	Buildings shall contain not more than six (6) dwelling units and may not be constructed within 20 feet of any other building. This provision may be modified for developments under single ownership, such as an apartment complex. 
                  g)	A buffer strip at least 20 feet wide shall be located adjacent to each exterior property line of the development and shall not be included within any individual home lot unless restricted as a buffer strip as required herein. This buffer shall be increased to a width of fifty feet when located adjacent to single-family conventional residences. This strip shall be planted with evergreen trees and hedge-type shrubs designed to provide full noise and sight screening. For properties adjoining Lake Sinclair, no buffer shall be required along the lake and no buffer adjoining other non-roadway property shall exceed 42 inches in height within 100 feet of the waters of said Lake. 
                  h)	Lighting within the development shall be designed in such a way as to minimize glare or direct illumination as to adjoining properties; 
                  i)	The plat requirements of this ordinance shall be complied with; 
                  j)	The requirements for restrictive covenants or declarations shall be complied with and all requirements of the Georgia Condominium Act shall be complied with for those developments that include multistory units that will not qualify for zero lot line development. 
                  k)	Applicants shall submit a detailed site plan and landscape plan and detailed plans for all amenities proposed. 
                  l)	Road and streets within the development shall be owned and maintained by the association unless county provides advance approval for county acceptance and maintenance. Whether roadways are to be privately owned or county owned, they shall have curb and gutter, be constructed in accord with county regulations for comparable roadways, and shall include such drainage improvements as necessary. 
                  m)	Bonus units. Developments that qualify for 6 or more points under the following development criteria shall be entitled to one additional unit per gross acre for density purposes; and developments that qualify for 12 or more points under this system shall be entitled to two additional units per gross acre for density purposes. In no event shall more than two bonus units be awarded to any development and bonus units shall in no way reduce any other requirements of this section. For a development to "abut" it must have not less than 20% of the boundary of the primary tract that adjoins the criterion item. 

                   
                  (Amd. of 8-2-2005) 
                  4.9.6	Gated subdivisions. 
                  A.	Gated subdivisions B public streets. Subdivisions which include a gate or other devise or method of limiting access to the streets which lie wholly within the subdivision may, upon application, be permitted within subdivisions, subject to the requirements of this section. Applications for approval of a "gated/limited access community/subdivision" shall first be submitted to the administrator. If the administrator denies the request, the developer may appeal that decision in the same manner as other appeals. No final plat involving limitations on access to public streets shall be approved unless said final plat conforms to the requirements of this section. 
                  1.	Eligibility. To be eligible for consideration for limiting access to public roadways within a subdivision, the development and its streets or roadways must meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  a.	All roadways subject to limitation on access must be newly constructed in accordance with county regulations by the developer for the purpose of providing access to the lots within that subdivision and the full costs of said roadways must have been paid for by developer. Roadways previously within the county road system or roadways designed to provide a connection between other county roadways or provide access to properties not included within the proposed subdivision or future phases thereof can not be restricted or subjected to any limitation on access. Subdivisions which have entrances onto more than one existing county roadway will not be ineligible solely for that reason. 
                  b.	The declaration of covenants for the subdivision which are required to be submitted for all subdivisions must provide for a homeowners' or property owners' association that shall be responsible for the ownership, maintenance, repair, upkeep and proper operation of any gate or other devise or method used to limit access over said streets, all subject to the conditions set out herein. Said declaration shall provide for assessments and the collection thereof that are deemed reasonable by the administrator for such purposes. 
                  2.	Extent of limitations on access. A subdivision eligible, and approved as provided herein, as a gated or limited access subdivision may make use of a gate or gates or other means to limit access over the public streets or roadways located wholly within said subdivision subject to the following conditions: 
                  a.	Access must be provided over said streets at all times to all public safety vehicles including police, fire and ambulances, for the provision of public safety services; and 
                  b.	Access must be provided over said streets during all normal working hours and during such additional times as required to provide the appropriate service for all other governmental and public service personnel such as building inspectors, utility service personnel, law enforcement and court personnel, and social service personnel for the provision of their normal services to the residents of said subdivision and/or facilities located within said subdivision or accessed by said subdivision streets; and 
                  c.	Access must be provided over said streets during those periods from 8:00 a.m. local time to 5:00 p.m. local time Monday through Friday, not to include national holidays, for access by the general public for any and all legitimate purposes that the general public may make use of said roadway(s), subject to the additional restrictions herein. The subdivision, through its restrictive covenants, and with proper signage may further limit or deny access to any member of the general public, who is not an invitee of an owner of property within the subdivision, by: 
                  i.	Denial of access onto any common area of the subdivision and/or any private property within the subdivision; and 
                  ii.	Denial of access over said street(s) if said access is for the purpose of soliciting, advertising, campaigning or any other like purpose; and 
                  iii.	Denial of access by pedestrian or other means other than by motor vehicles which are approved for transport on public roadways; and 
                  iv.	Restricting the noise level from any vehicle upon its streets so long as those restrictions apply to all vehicles; and 
                  v.	Deny any parking, stopping, or standing upon said roadways. 
                  3.	Methods of limitations on access. Limitations on access must be provided by at least one of the following methods or a combination thereof, which must be approved by county prior to final approval of the subdivision plat and not less than 10 days prior to the activation of any limitation on access: 
                  (a)	A guard located at the entrance(s) that is available 24-hours per day; 
                  (b)	Providing an override code to the main gate for all emergency vehicles; 
                  (c)	Providing a system that allows access in response to a "yelp" signal from an emergency vehicle; 
                  (d)	Providing a system that allows access during normal workweek hours for non-emergency personnel; and/or 
                  (e)	Providing a system that allows access for the general public during the times set out above for such legitimate purposes, and subject to such additional limitations, as set out above. 
                  If a guardhouse, gate or other mechanical method is used to limit access, then said guardhouse, gate or other mechanical method shall be located not less than 60 feet from the edge of the pavement of the public roadway with which the subdivision entrance intersects, and not less than 50 feet from the right of way of said existing public roadway. Said entrance shall include a turn-around in the nature of a cul de sac that will allow traffic that is properly denied access, to be able to return to the existing public roadway without undue inconvenience and without undue disruption of traffic on the existing public roadway. 
                  If a gate or other mechanical method is used to limit access, then said system shall automatically open and remain open during any time in which there is an interruption of power to, or other malfunction of, the device. 
                  If alterations are made to the gate or other method of limiting access without proper and prior notification that hinder the access of public safety vehicles and obstruct the provision of public safety services, or hinder or obstruct the access by other authorized personnel, then said public safety personnel and/or other authorized personnel may use such reasonable means as available to them to gain access and the developer and/or homeowners' association shall be responsible for damages incurred because of such hindrance or obstruction and/or the removal thereof. In the event a member of the general public is denied access in violation of the provisions for general public access provided above, then county shall be authorized through its designee to use such reasonable means as available to them to gain access as provided herein for said members of the general public and the developer and/or homeowners' association shall be responsible for damages incurred because of such hindrance or obstruction and/or the removal thereof. In the event that such denials of access or obstructions to access are without reasonable cause or the reason therefor is not remedied on a timely basis, then the county may withdraw the right of limiting access and said roadways shall become accessible to all in the same manner and to the same extent as all other county roadways on which there are no limitations on access. 
                  4.	Conversion to a gated subdivision with private streets. In the event that a subdivision has been approved as a gated subdivision with limited access over its streets and desires to convert said subdivision to a gated subdivision with private streets, then the developer and/or homeowners'/property owners' association may apply for such approval and upon full compliance with all of the provisions provided in this code for such subdivisions, shall be granted that approval with county to deed to said homeowners' association any and all interest it has in said streets, subject to the retention by it of the access rights provided in this code and retention of such easements regarding utilities as provided in said code. The conveyance by a developer to county of roadways in a subdivision which has been approved for limited access shall be with the condition, whether specifically stated or not, that said streets are subject to being converted to private streets as provided herein. Such an application shall include an acknowledgement of responsibility in the same basic format as that provided for in the regulations regarding private streets designated therein as purchaser's acknowledgement of private responsibilities. This acknowledgement shall be signed by not less than 75% of the owners of property in the subdivision in addition to the property owned by the developer. 
                  B.	Gated subdivisions—private streets. Private streets may, upon application, be permitted by the board of commissioners within major subdivisions, subject to the requirements of this section. Applications for approval of private streets shall be considered by the board of commissioners at the time of preliminary plat approval or as a conversion from a gated subdivision with limited access as provided herein. Application for private streets in a major subdivision shall first be submitted to the administrator. If the administrator denies the request, the developer may appeal that decision in the same manner as other appeals. In the event that the planning commission approves the request or in the event the administrator initially approves the request, then the administrator's or planning commission's recommendation to authorize private streets in a major subdivision, shall be submitted to the board of commissioners and the board shall consider the application and may impose conditions on the approval of private streets to ensure various public purposes and to mitigate potential problems with private streets. No final plat involving a private street shall be approved unless said final plat conforms to the requirements of this section. 
                  1.	Engineering plans required. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to construct a new private street or alter an existing private street or to cause the same to be done without first obtaining approval of engineering and construction plans from the administrator, who shall consult with the county engineer and/or road superintendent in accordance with the requirements of this code. 
                  2.	Standards. All private streets shall be constructed to all standards for public streets as required by article 5 of this code, and applicable construction specifications of the administrator. 
                  3.	Street names and signs. Private streets shall be named, subject to the approval of the administrator. The developer of land involving a private street shall install street signs with content containing the street name and the designation "private," as approved by the administrator. The sign signifying the private street may be required by the administrator to be a different color than that of street signs provided for public streets, in order to distinguish maintenance responsibilities in the field. 
                  4.	Easements. Easements for private streets shall be designated on final plats as general-purpose public access and utility easements, along with the name of said private streets. Said easements shall at a minimum be of the same width as that required for the right-of-way of a public street by the major thoroughfare plan for the type of public street (local, collector, etc.) most closely resembling the proposed private street. Easements for private streets shall not be included in any calculation of minimum lot size or density limitations established by local land use regulations. In the cases of private streets, the general-purpose public access and utility easement for the private street shall either: 
                  (a)	Be shown in a manner on the final plat such that each lot fronting the private street extends to the centerline of the private street. No lot shall be permitted to be divided by the general purpose public access and utility easement required and established for a private street; or 
                  (b)	Shall be drawn as its own discrete parcel to be dedicated to a private homeowners association (i.e., not shown to be a part of any lot). 
                  5.	Maintenance. The county shall not maintain, repair, resurface, rebuild, or otherwise improve streets, signs, drainage improvements or any other appurtenances within general purpose public access and utility easements established for private streets. A private maintenance covenant recorded with the county clerk of the superior court shall be required for any private street and other improvements within general-purpose public access and utility easements established for private streets. The covenant shall set out the distribution of expenses, remedies for non-compliance with the terms of the agreement, rights to the use of easements, and other pertinent considerations. The covenant shall specifically include the following terms. 
                  (a)	The covenant shall establish minimum annual assessments in an amount adequate to defray costs of ordinary maintenance and procedures for approval of additional needed assessments. The covenant shall also specify that the funds from such assessments will be held by a homeowners' or property owners' association in cases of a subdivision often or more lots fronting on a private street. 
                  (b)	The covenant shall include a periodic maintenance schedule. 
                  (c)	The covenant for maintenance shall be enforceable by any property owner served by the private street and shall also be enforceable by Baldwin County. Said covenant shall state that Baldwin County may enforce said covenant, but shall have no duty to do so and that primary enforcement shall be by the property owner(s). 
                  (d)	The covenant shall establish a formula for assessing maintenance and repair costs equitably to property owners served by the private street. 
                  (e)	The covenant shall run with the land. 
                  (f)	The board of commissioners shall, at its discretion, as a condition of approving private streets, require a performance bond and/or maintenance bond be submitted by the developer and held by a homeowners' or property owners' association, with said board as additional beneficiary of said bond(s), or require that the developer and/or property owners pay an amount of money as determined by the administrator into an escrow account or other suitable account for the maintenance and repair of private streets and stormwater management improvements, to be drawn from by the homeowners' or property owners' association as maintenance and repair needs may arise. The formula for establishing the costs of the repair and replacement of the roadways shall be based upon county's costs for such repairs on its roadways over the preceding two years; and 
                  (g)	The covenants may not provide for any payment directly or indirectly by said association to the developer for the costs of the initial construction of said roadways. 
                  6.	Specifications for final plats involving private streets. The director shall not approve for recording any final plat involving a private street unless and until it shall contain the following on the face of the plat: 
                  (a)	Deed book and page reference to the recorded covenant required by this section; 
                  (b)	"WARNING, Baldwin County has no responsibility to build, improve, maintain, or otherwise service the private streets, drainage improvements, and other appurtenances contained within the general public purpose access and utility easement or easements for private streets shown on this plat."; 
                  (c)	"Grant of Easement. The general purpose public access and utility easement(s) shown on this plat for private street(s) is hereby granted and said grant of rights shall be liberally construed to provide all necessary authority to the county and to public or private utility companies serving the subdivision, for the installation and maintenance of utilities, including, but not limited to, electric lines, gas lines, telephone lines, water lines, sewer lines, cable television lines, and fiber optic cables, together with the right to trim interfering trees and brush, together with a perpetual right of ingress and egress for installation, maintenance, and replacement of such lines. 
                  ____________ 
                  Signature of Property Owner"; and 
                  (d)	(The following certificate of dedication shall be required, unless the Board of Commissioners waives the dedication requirement.) 
                  "Certificate of Dedication. All water and sewer lines installed within the general purpose public access and utility easement(s) shown on this plat for private street(s) are hereby dedicated to Baldwin County. 
                  ____________ 
                  Signature of Property Owner." 
                  7.	Requirement for purchaser's acknowledgement of private responsibilities. Prior to the sale or as a condition of the closing of a real estate transaction involving any lot served by a private street in the county, the developer or seller of said lot shall require the execution of a notarized purchaser's acknowledgement of private street construction and drainage maintenance responsibilities as set forth below. A copy of the purchaser's acknowledgement shall be retained by the purchaser and shall be required to be submitted as a condition of a building permit for a principal building on said lot: 

                   
                  8.	Extent of limitations on access to private streets. A subdivision served by private streets may make use of a gate or gates or other means to limit access over its private streets, subject to the following conditions: 
                  a.	Access must be provided over said private streets at all times to all public safety vehicles including police, fire and ambulances, for the provision of public safety services; and 
                  b.	Access must be provided over said private streets during all normal working hours and during such additional times as required to provide the appropriate service for all other governmental and public service personnel such as building inspectors, utility service personnel, law enforcement and court personnel, and social service personnel for the provision of their normal services to the residents of said subdivision and/or facilities located within said subdivision or accessed by said private streets. 
                  9.	Methods of limiting access to private streets. Access must be provided by at least one of the following methods or combination of methods, which must be approved by county prior to final approval of the subdivision plat and not less than 10 days prior to the activation of any limitation on access: 
                  (a)	A guard located at the entrance(s) that is available 24-hours per day; 
                  (b)	Providing an override code to the main gate for all emergency vehicles; 
                  (c)	Providing a system that allows access in response to a "yelp" signal from an emergency vehicle; and/or 
                  (d)	Providing a system that allows access during normal workweek hours for non-emergency personnel. 
                  If a guardhouse, gate or other mechanical method is used to limit access, then said guardhouse, gate or other mechanical method shall be located not less than 60 feet from the edge of the pavement of the public roadway with which the subdivision entrance intersects, and not less than 50 feet from the right of way of said existing public roadway. Said entrance shall include a turn-around in the nature of a cul de sac that will allow traffic that is properly denied access, to be able to return to the existing public roadway without undue inconvenience and without undue disruption of traffic on the existing public roadway. 
                  If a gate or other mechanical method is used to limit access, then said system shall automatically open and remain open during any time in which there is an interruption of power to, or other malfunction of, the device. 
                  If alterations are made to the gate or other method of limiting access without proper and prior notification that hinder the access of public safety vehicles and obstruct the provision of public safety services, or hinder or obstruct the access by other authorized personnel, then said public safety personnel and/or other authorized personnel may use such reasonable means as available to them to gain access and the developer and/or homeowners' association shall be responsible for damages incurred because of such hindrance or obstruction and/or the removal thereof. 
                  (Amd. of 7-20-2004) 
                  4.9.7	Water/sewer provision. When any proposed development is within 2,500 feet of existing public water and/or sewer service, the developer shall provide a proposal for the extension of said service to said development and the availability of same to each development unit. The development may be denied approval if the county determines that such development without such services would necessitate excessive expenditure of public funds for the provision and maintenance of such services. 
                  (Amd. of 7-1-1991; Amd. of 11-6-1991) 
                  Sec. 4.10. - General requirements for street and other rights of way. 
                  4.10.1	Paving, curbing and guttering requirements. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to provide for paving for all streets within the subdivision in compliance with this code, including articles 4 and 5. In addition the developer shall stripe said roadways in accordance with DOT requirements for secondary roads; and shall provide all normal traffic, safety and street signs for the subdivision, each intersection thereof, and all intersections with existing public roadways. 
                  4.10.2	Street names. Street names shall require the approval of the administrator. Streets that are obviously in alignment with streets already existing and named shall be given the name of the existing streets. Names of new streets shall not duplicate or closely approximate those of existing streets. 
                  4.10.3	Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 115 feet shall not be permitted. 
                  4.10.4	Cul-de-sacs. Except where topographic or other conditions make a greater length impractical, cul-de-sacs, or deadend streets, shall not be greater in length than 800 feet. They shall be provided at the closed end with a turn-around having a property line radius of at least 50 feet with an outside pavement radius of at least 40 feet. 
                  4.10.5	Development along existing roadways. 
                  (a)	Entry to subdivisions. There shall be not less than one entry into the subdivision for each 100 lots or parts thereof. There shall be a buffer strip beginning at the intersection of each subdivision street right-of-way line and each public road right-of-way line. These buffer strips shall run not less than 100 feet along the subdivision right-of-way line and not less than 50 feet deep. No improvements shall be placed upon these strips except an entry-way sign for the subdivision. In the event that an additional entry or entries for subdivisions over 100 lots would not be feasible due to the limited road access, sight lines, other safety factors, or size and/or shape of the development, then the administrator may require acceleration and deceleration lanes, turning lanes, and increased road right-of-way along the entire frontage of the property as an alternate; and 
                  (b)	Development along existing major street, limited access highway or railroad right-of-way. 
                  (i)	Developments of more than 10 lots - Development shall be in accord with paragraph (d) below; and 
                  (ii)	Developments of 10 lots or less - Development shall be in accord with paragraph c) below; and 
                  (c)	Development along existing county vehicular service roads. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing county vehicular service road, the administrator may require acceleration or deceleration lanes and/or a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way either as a marginal access street or, at a distance suitable for an appropriate use to the intervening land, with a nonaccess reservation. In addition, the administrator shall require that no more than one access for every 300 feet shall be allowed onto existing county vehicular services roads, by requiring use of common access areas or use of said marginal access streets; and 
                  (d)	Developments of more than 20 lots. As to developments of more than 20 lots: 
                  (i)	No lot shall front upon or have direct access onto an existing county, state or federal roadway; and 
                  (ii)	A buffer strip at least twenty feet wide shall be located adjacent to each exterior property line of the development including existing public roadways. This buffer may be included within any individual home lot if the lot size is increased by an additional 10 feet of depth and the entire 20 feet is restricted as a buffer strip as required herein. This strip shall be planted with evergreen trees and hedge-type shrubs designed to provide full noise and sight screening and shall have no improvements located thereon; and 
                  (iii)	In addition to the buffer required in paragraph ii.) there shall be set aside for the use and enjoyment of the owners of the subdivision a community park or parks, greenways, or recreational areas of the greater of two acres or one-tenth of an acre for the first 50 lots in the subdivision and one-twentieth of an acre per lot for all lots over 50 in the subdivision, with said area(s) accessible to all of the lots in the subdivision. This set-aside shall include not less than one composite area containing not less than 2 acres for each 50 lots in the subdivision. For example, a 100-lot subdivision would have one composite area of not less than four acres or two composite areas of not less than two acres each. The remaining greenway may be in the nature of buffer strips between adjacent lots and/or along the rear of the lots. Buffers, common areas, and greenways are intended to enhance the liveability of the subdivision and to benefit the owners thereof. The requirements cannot be met by the set-aside of irregular strips and gores or incidental open spaces which have no realistic use by the proposed residents on a day-to-day basis. The developer must justify the set-asides as consistent with the intent and purpose of these provisions; and 
                  (iv)	The administrator may waive or modify these requirements as to lots which front upon a nonconnecting county roadway (cul-de-sac or dead end) or which front upon a county roadway originally developed as part of an existing subdivision if the developer can provide evidence that such waiver or modification will not have an undue adverse impact upon the safety and/or asthetic goals and purposes of this regulation. 
                  4.10.6	Alleys. Alleys may be required at the rear of all lots used for multifamily, commercial, or industrial developments. 
                  4.10.7	Reserve strips. Reserve strips controlling access to streets, alleys, and public grounds shall not be permitted unless their control is placed in the hands of Baldwin County, under conditions approved by the administrator. 
                  4.10.8	Easements. Easements having a minimum width of ten (10) feet and located along the side or rear lot lines of a subdivision lot shall be provided as required for utility lines and underground mains and cables. These easements must be shown on the final plat. 
                  Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater or drainage right-of-way of adequate width. Parallel streets may be required by the administrator in connection therewith.

                  Sec. 4.11. - Design standards for blocks and lots. 
                  4.11.1	Block lengths and widths. Block lengths and widths shall be as follows: 
                  (a)	Blocks shall not be greater than 1,200 feet in length nor less than 400 feet in length, except where approved by the administrator. 
                  (b)	Block shall be wide enough to provide two tiers of lots of minimum depth, except where abutting upon major streets, limited-access highways, or railroads or where other situations make this requirement impracticable. 
                  4.11.2	Lot sizes. Residential lots shall meet or exceed the lot width and the lot area requirements as prescribed herein, unless greater requirements are imposed by other code provisions: 
                  Residential lots shall have a depth of not less than 120 feet; 
                  Commercial and industrial lots shall be adequate to provide service areas and off-street parking suitable to use intended; and 
                  Residential corner lots shall have adequate width to meet building setback requirements from both abutting streets. 
                  4.11.3	Lot lines. All lot lines shall be perpendicular or radial to street lines, unless not practicable because of topographic or other features. 
                  4.11.4	Building lines. Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, there is hereby established a building setback line of 35 feet for the front yard setback; and 15 feet for each side and rear line. 
                  4.11.5	Lots abutting public streets. 
                  a.	(1)	Each lot shall abut upon a dedicated public street for not less than 100 feet except cul-de-sac lots which may have a minimum street frontage of not less than 50 feet; and 
                  (2)	No lot shall be approved which constitutes a flag lot except: 
                  i.)	With special approval from the planning commission due to extreme topographic circumstances. If such approval is granted, no more than 10% of the lots in the development may be flag lots and frontage may not be less than 50 feet for any lot; or 
                  ii.)	For tracts larger than 50 acres which have more than 80% of their land area more than 500 feet from the public roadway. 
                  iii.)	Flag lots are herein defined as a tract or lot of land of uneven dimensions in which the portion fronting on a street is less than the required minimum width required for construction of a building or structure on that lot. 
                  b.	Restricted exemption for tracts with limited road frontage: The requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section are here modified so as to alleviate hardship as to tracts which had limited public road access on or before July 1, 1991, subject to compliance with all of the following conditions. Tracts may be divided pursuant to this section only once and the resulting tracts may not be divided without full compliance with all provisions of the Baldwin County Land Use Code. The phased development provisions of this code shall not apply to such subdivisions. In cases of such divisions, the developer shall be responsible for the maintenance of any easement, roadway or access to the lots which is over nonpublic roads. 
                  This modification of the requirements of this section shall apply only to tracts which existed as separate tracts on July 1, 1991, and had public road access of less than 240 feet. As to such tracts, a division under this paragraph may be made if such division complies with all of the following requirements: 
                  1.	A qualifying tract may be divided into no more than three lots; 
                  2.	The resulting lots shall comply with all other regulations of the land use code, such as minimum widths at building line, setback lines, health department regulations, and other applicable regulations; 
                  3.	The resulting lots shall each be at least one acre or the minimum size provided in section 6.2.1, whichever is larger; 
                  4.	The public road access to the tract shall be equally divided between the resulting lots; 
                  5.	If the lots front less than 20 each on public roads, then joint easements for access shall be provided to the owners of all lots over the entire access area; and 
                  6.	The proposed division shall require the submission to the administrator of the proposed plat prepared in compliance with the requirements of this regulation and in addition to all other certifications, shall contain an affidavit of the owner that the tract to be subdivided: 
                  a.	Was a separate and distinct tract on July 1, 1991, which had less than a total of 240 feet of public road frontage; 
                  b.	That the proposed subdivision complies with all requirements of this section; 
                  c.	That the access will be privately owned and maintained and shall not be eligible for acceptance as public roadways except upon compliance by the owners with county regulations regarding right-of-way widths, construction and paving; 
                  d.	That the property may not be further divided without compliance with the minimum public road frontage requirements set forth in paragraph A hereof; and 
                  e.	That certified copies of deeds or other documents establishing the status of the title on July 1, 1991, shall be supplied to the administrator. 
                  7.	The final plat of the tract shall be recorded prior to the transfer of any property in the resulting subdivision and shall bear a conspicuous certificate of the administrator in substantially the following language: 
                  "Notice: 
                  1. The Baldwin County Commission does not undertake to provide public road access to these lots nor is it obligated to pave or maintain roads providing access to these lots. 
                  2. It may not be possible to divide the lots shown on this plat The lots may not be divided into smaller tracts without complying with all provisions of the Baldwin County Land Use Code, particularly those relating to public road access." 
                  4.11.6	Double and reverse frontage lots. Double frontage, and reverse frontage lots, should be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.

Private driveway - Drive or any designated right-of-way or easement therefor, for vehicular access from public rights-of-way to private property, which are not under the jurisdictional control of the state nor intended or acceptable for such control, and which is not owned and maintained or intended to be owned and maintained by the county as a public road. 
                  5.3.2	Classification authority. The county commission shall have the authority to classify all roads and road rights-of-way within the county that are owned by the county or which are subject to county maintenance by public use and designation. The classification of all such roads and road rights-of-way as shall have existed and been mapped upon the effective date of this code shall be as identified on the Road Classification Map of Baldwin County, Georgia as shall have been prepared and adopted by the county commission. 
                  The county commission shall classify all new or proposed roads and road rights-of-way. Until such time as a new or proposed road or road right-of-way shall have been classified by the county commission, it shall be deemed a private drive and shall not be represented as anything but a private drive and therefore not subject to improvements and maintenance as a public road. 
                  No new or proposed road or road right-of-way shall be accepted and approved as a public road until and after it shall have been classified by the county commission in a manner consistent with the provisions of this code.

                  Sec. 5.5. - Standards for public road improvement. 
                  The following improvements shall be made before the county commission may accept a residential or nonresidential land service road and right-of-way therefor for public ownership and maintenance. Wherever a specification of the Georgia Department of Transportation is referred to in this article said reference is made to the appropriate section of the Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, Department of Transportation, State of Georgia, 1972 Edition, as thereafter amended and supplemented. 
                  5.5.1	Preparation of right-of-way. The full width of all rights-of-way shall be shaped to approximate required grades, alignment, and other specifications such that base and wearing surfaces can be constructed, which will not damage abutting property. Abutting property shall be suitably sloped to the right-of-way line. Due regard shall be shown for desirable trees and other vegetative matter not impairing visibility. 
                  Before grading is started, the entire area of the right-of-way shall be cleared of all exposed stumps, logs, grass, weeds, roots, rubbish, loose boulders, and other debris or otherwise objectionable material protruding through the ground surface. 
                  All tree stumps, boulders, and other obstructions shall be removed to a minimum depth of two (2) feet below the finished surface of all slopes and the area to which base material is to be applied. Rock whenever encountered shall be scarified or removed to a depth of twelve (12) inches below the subgrade. 
                  All suitable material from roadway cuts may be used in the construction of fills, approaches, or at other places as needed. Excess materials, including organic materials, soft clays, etc., shall be removed from the development site. The fill shall be spread in layers not to exceed twelve (12) inches loose and compacted by a sheepsfoot roller. The filling of utility trenches and other places not accessible to a roller shall bemechanically tamped. 
                  5.5.2	Embankments and erosion control. Immediately after grading and filling and respreading of topsoil, all shoulders and slopes within the right-of-way shall be stabilized to retard erosion and drainage facilities open or temporary slope drains constructed to accommodate and direct acceptable surface water runoff, all to be in compliance with the Baldwin County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance. At a minimum, developer shall provide permanent-type grassing. 
                  5.5.3	Ditches and drains. Each road and road right-of-way shall have a drainage system adequate to provide for the proper drainage of all surface water.

                  Size openings of all cross drains shall be as required by the county public works supervisor. Cross drains shall be built on straight line and grade, and shall be laid on a firm base, but not on rock. Pipes shall be laid with spigot ends pointing in the direction of the water flow. Ends shall be properly fitted and matched to provide tight joints and a smooth, uniform invert. Drains shall be placed at sufficient depth below the roadbed to avoid dangerous pressure of impact, and in no case shall the top of the drain pipe be less than one (1) foot below the roadway base. 
                  Drainage ditches shall be constructed along both sides of the roadway. All ditches shall be two (2) feet deep and have an invert of two (2) feet. The front slope of the ditch shall have a horizontal-to-vertical slope ratio of not less than 3:1, and a back slope of not less than 2:1. All ditches shall be stabilized to retard erosion. 
                  Concrete, corrugated metal or plastic (if approved) side drains with size openings of not less than fifteen (15) inches shall be installed to provide for surface water drainage under all driveways. 
                  5.5.4	Roadway base and shoulder. The base material shall extend not less than one foot beyond the paving edge. The minimum type of roadway base and shoulder material allowed shall be topsoil, sand-clay, crusher run stone, or chert which shall have physical properties equivalent to that required for Class B material gradation contained in Georgia D.O.T. Specifications, section 303.01 to 303.05, inclusive. 
                  For residential land service roads the roadway and shoulder base shall have a minimum compacted depth of six (6) inches and a 100% dry density compaction. For nonresidential land service roads the corresponding minimum compacted depth shall be a minimum of six (6) inches and a 100% dry density compaction. 
                  5.5.5	Prime coat. All finished base surfaces shall have a bituminous prime coat applied before surface treatment material is spread. The minimum acceptable prime coat material shall be cutback asphalt of a grade as required by the county public works supervisor based on temperature and the texture of the base surface. 
                  The prime coat shall be applied at the rate of twenty-five hundredths (0.25) of a gallon per square yard of base. Application of the prime coat shall be consistent with Georgia D.O.T. Specifications, section 412.04. 
                  Surface Treatment: After prime coat has been properly cured, a permanent wearing surface shall be applied to the roadway base. 
                  For residential land service roads, the minimum acceptable wearing surface shall consist of Type I bituminous treatment using stone, size 5, aggregate with a bituminous seal using stone, size 7 and 89, shall conform to the provisions of Georgia D.O.T.

                  5.5.6	[Concrete paving.] Concrete paving may be used as an alternative subject to the following minimum county specifications: 
                  (a)	Any subgrade on which concrete is placed directly shall meet soil requirements for a class I or class II soil. A III A soil would be acceptable provided it is stabilized with a minimum of 150 pounds per square yard of crusher run stone. (A minimum of 6 inches in depth is required of all base material.) 100% compaction using standard density is required. 
                  (b)	A 5-inch concrete slab is required that uses a 5.75 bags/CYD mixture and provides 3,500 pounds per square inch minimum compression strength and approximately a minimum average strength of 4,300 pounds per square inch, to be compatible with a modulas of rupture 550 P.S.I. If concrete paving is placed without tied in concrete shoulders or curbs, at least ½ inches of slab thickness is required to insure compliance with minimum compression a minimum average strength requirements provided herein. 
                  (c)	Transverse joints should not be spaced further apart than 15 feet. 
                  (d)	All other road preparation and construction requirements not in conflict with these specific requirements shall be required for the use of concrete paving as an alternate. 
                  (e)	Not less than 10 days notice of use of this alternative shall be given to the county by written notice to the county clerk. 
                  5.5.7	Control of work and inspections. The county public works supervisor shall have the authority to control the construction of all residential and nonresidential land service roads. In exercising such authority, the county public works supervisor shall decide all questions concerning the acceptability of materials and construction methods. The county public works supervisor shall have the authority to inspect all construction work done and materials used to determine compliance with the provisions of this article. Whenever the county public works supervisor finds that materials and/or work performed are not in compliance with this code, he may require the removal, replacement, or otherwise require the correction of the nonconformity. The county public works supervisor, however may, not waive or reduce the requirements of any provisions of this code. 
                  5.5.8	Guarantee in lieu of completed improvements. No new or extended residential or nonresidential land service road shall be approved and accepted by the county commission for public ownership and maintenance, and no subdivision plat containing such a road shall be given final approval until one of the following conditions shall have been met. 
                  a.	All roads, right-of-way and drainage facilities are designed and constructed consistent with the provisions of this article and so approved by the county public works supervisor, or 
                  b.	The county commission shall have accepted a surety bond in an amount equal to one and one-half times the estimated cost of all required road, right-of-way, and drainage facility improvements, so that if the builder defaults, required improvements may be made by the county commission without using public funds therefor. The county commission shall determine the estimated cost of required improvements. 
                  5.5.9	Maintenance bond. Prior to acceptance of road and/or drainage improvements, the land owner shall provide a suitable maintenance bond approved by county to assure that said roadway and/or drainage improvements are still in full compliance with county requirements for two (2) years from the date of acceptance of the road and/or drainage improvements. The maintenance bond shall be in an amount equal to not less than $50,000.00 per mile or portion thereof. For example, a road of .6 miles in length requires not less than a $50,000.00 bond and a road of 1.4 miles in length requires not less than a $100,000.00 bond. When, in the opinion of the code administrator and the county engineer or county road superintendent, the nature of the roadway and/or improvements are such as to require a bond of greater amount, the said administrator and engineer or superintendent shall establish such an amount and provide to the land owner written explanation for such a requirement.

                  6.1.2	Completion of existing buildings. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the plans, construction, designated use, or occupancy of a building or structure for which: 
                  a.	There is physical evidence that construction had commenced under a valid building permit prior to the effective date of this code and where the entire building or structure shall be completed within one (1) year from the effective date of this code; or 
                  b.	A building permit had been issued pursuant to the requirements of previous development regulations as may have been modified or repealed by this code and where the entire building or structure should be completed within six (6) months from the effective date of this code. 
                  6.1.3	Violations and remedies. A violation of any provisions of this article or failure to comply with any of it requirements, including violations of performance standards or a grant of variance, or a violation of any lawful order of the code enforcement administrator is hereby declared to be a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof shall be punishable as provided by law. Each and every day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. 
                  The owner or tenant of any land, building, structure, or part thereof, and any architect, builder, contractor, agent, or other person who commits, participates in, assists in, or maintains such violation may each be found guilty of a separate offense. 
                  Nothing contained in this article shall prevent the county, or any property owner who would be specifically damaged by such violation, from taking such other lawful action, including civil action, as necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
                  6.1.4	Enforcing officer. The provisions of this article shall be administered and enforced by the administrator. The administrator shall have the right to enter upon any property or into any building or structure for the purpose of making inspections as necessary to carry out his duties in the enforcement of this article.

                  6.1.5	Required building permit. Except as otherwise provided in this article, it shall be unlawful to commence the construction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure or to change the use of a building or structure or of land, except changes in agricultural crops, until the administrator shall have issued an applicable permit therefor. Application for an appropriate permit shall be made to the administrator on forms provided for that purpose. 
                  The administrator shall have the authority to require that every application for a building permit contain or be accompanied by sufficient information regarding the lot, parcel, or building site, the use and placement of buildings and structures, thereon, and adjoining properties as may be necessary for the administrator to determine whether or not the proposed activity is in conformity with the provisions of this article. 
                  6.1.6	Public health certification. The administrator shall not issue a building permit where the proposed building, structure, or use involves on-site means of sewage disposal until the application shall have first obtained the written certification of the county health officer that on-site disposal means can satisfactorily accommodate the expected sewage discharge from the proposed use, and that the site on which the proposed use is located or is to be located contains sufficient land area to accommodate the on-site disposal of the expected discharges without adversely affecting ground or surface water supplies. 
                  6.1.7	Permit issuance and expiration. If the proposed activity, for which an application has been made for a building permit, has been determined by the administrator to be in conformity with the provisions of this article, the administrator shall issue a building permit authorizing the proposed activity. 
                  The issuance of a building permit shall in no case be construed as waiving any provisions of this code. Building permits shall be void after six (6) months from the date of issuance unless, in the opinion of the administrator, satisfactory progress is made by that time. 
                  6.1.8	Certificate of compliance. No land or structure for which a building permit has been issued shall be occupied or used until the county building officer shall have issued a certificate of code compliance thereof. 
                  A certificate of compliance shall be issued only when the building, structure, and/or land is determined to be in conformity with the provisions of this code. No certificate of compliance shall be issued for any use of land or structure where on-site means of sewage disposal are employed until the county health officer shall have certified in writing his approval of the installation and operation of such on-site disposal means. 
                  If a certificate of compliance is not granted upon request the administrator shall state in writing the reasons for such action, and shall identify any corrections or modifications necessary for compliance certification. 
                  6.1.9	Disapproval of permit application. Whenever an application for a building permit shall have been disapproved, the administrator shall state in writing on the application the cause for such disapproval and shall notify the applicant immediately of the reasons for disapproval. 
                  Thereafter, the applicant may re-apply for a building permit provided he overcomes, to the satisfaction of the administrator, the causes for previous disapproval, or the applicant may institute appeal proceedings or legal action. 
                  (Amd. of 7-1-1991) 
                  Sec. 6.2. - Intensity of use. 
                  6.2.1	Minimum lot size. No building or other structure designed or used for human occupancy, congregation, or employment, or otherwise requiring on-site means of sewage disposal, may be used or constructed on any lot, parcel, or tract of land which does not contain at least the following minimum size and lot width at the building line, and for an area which includes the structure and the septic system, when applicable: 
                  I.	As to one single family dwelling per lot: 
                  a.)	As to lots which do not have either public/community water or public sewer service one and one-half acres with minimum with of 200 feet; and 
                  b.)	As to lots which have either public/community water or public sewer service - one (1) Acre with minimum width of 125 feet; 
                  c.)	As to lots which have both public water and sewerage service - three-fourths (¾) of an acre with minimum width of 125 feet; and 
                  d.)	As to lots which have both public water and sewerage service and are located in a subdivision which complies with all requirements of the current subdivision regulations and the following additional requirements, - one-half acre with a minimum width of 115 feet. Additional MINIMUM requirements to qualify for this exception: 
                  i.)	That the subdivision streets include curb and gutter and drainage water structures engineered to comply with applicable DOT regulations regarding stormwater runoff; and 
                  ii.)	The subdivision is restricted so that only one single family residence may be constructed on each lot and said lots shall be restricted to single family residential use only; and 
                  iii.)	No lot shall front upon or have direct access onto an existing county, state or federal roadway; and 
                  iv.)	A buffer strip at least twenty feet wide shall be located adjacent to each exterior property line of the development including existing public roadways. This buffer may be included within any individual home lot if the lot size is increased by an additional 10 feet of depth and the entire 20 feet is restricted as a buffer strip as required herein. This strip shall be planted with evergreen trees and hedge-type shrubs designed to provide full noise and sight screening and shall have no improvements located thereon; and 
                  v.)	In addition to the buffer required in paragraph iv.) There shall be set aside for the use and enjoyment of the owners of the subdivision a community park or parks, greenways, or recreational areas of the greater of two acres or one-tenth of an acre for the first 50 lots in the subdivision and one-twentieth of an acre per lot for all lots over 50 in the subdivision, with said area(s) accessible to all of the lots in the subdivision. This set-aside shall include not less than one composite area containing not less than 2 acres for each 50 lots in the subdivision. For example, a 100 lot subdivision would have one composite area of not less than four acres or two composite areas of not less than two acres each. The remaining greenway may be in the nature of buffer strips between adjacent lots and/or along the rear of the lots. Buffers, common areas, and greenways are intended to enhance the liveability of the subdivision and to benefit the owners thereof. The requirements can not be met by the set-aside of irregular strips and gores or incidental open spaces which have no realistic use by the proposed residents on a day-to-day basis. To qualify for this exception, the developer must justify the set-asides as consistent with the intent and purpose of these provisions; and 
                  vi.)	There shall be not less than one entry into the subdivision foe each 100 lots or parts thereof. There shall be a buffer strip beginning at the intersection of each subdivision street right-of-way line and each public road right-of-way line. These buffer strips shall run not less than 100 feet along the subdivision right-of-way line and not less than 30 feet deep. No improvements shall be placed upon these strips except an entry-way sign for the subdivision; and 
                  vii.)	Acceleration and deceleration lanes at the entry(s) shall be provided as required by the administrator for all subdivisions with more than 50 lots. For subdivisions with less than 50 lots, these lanes shall be required for entries onto all state highways and all major county roadways; and 
                  viii.)	Restrictive and protective covenants shall be submitted for approval. These covenants shall have provisions regarding the size and nature of improvements, setbacks, building materials, and use consistent with the greater density allowed by this exception. These covenants shall limit dwellings to two stories in height and shall require concrete driveways to service each home. In addition, these covenants shall make provision for the ownership, maintenance and control of the common, recreational, buffer and greenways provided for herein; and 
                  ix.)	This section provides an exception to the requirement that minimum lot sizes be not less than ¾th of an acre. To have the benefit of this exception, proposals are expected to exceed the provisions herein, which are MINIMUM requirements. It is the intention that no variances be granted in regard to the minimum requirements provided for herein. 
                  II.	As to one duplex per lot: 
                  a.)	As to lots which do not have either public/community water or public sewer service two (2) acres with minimum width of 200 feet; and 
                  b.)	As to lots which have either public/community water or public sewer service - one and one-half (1.5) acre with minimum width of 150 feet; 
                  c.)	As to lots which have both public water and sewerage service - one (1) acre with minimum width of 150 feet; 
                  III.	As to triplexes, quads and other multifamily: 
                  See code section 4.9.5 or multiply the minimum land area provisions for one single family dwelling times the number of housing units to determine lot size and increase the minimum lot widths by 25 feet for each additional housing unit above one. 
                  IV.	Lots existing prior to November 6, 1991, may be used for any building purposes provided that the lots are connected to a central or public water supply and provided that the lot complies with the minimum setback lines set forth herein. 
                  6.2.2	Lot modifications for sanitary purposes. Where individual septic tanks or other such on-site disposal facilities are to be used as a means of sewage disposal, the county health officer may require increases in the minimum lot size as necessary to conform to rules and recommendations of the Georgia Department of Public Health. 
                  In no case, however, shall the lot size be reduced to less than the required minimum as established herein. 
                  6.2.3	Building setbacks. No building or structure shall be located closer than thirty-five (35) feet to the right-of-way line of any public road nor closer than seventy-five (75) feet to the centerline of any public road, whichever is the greater distance. As to corner lots, these setbacks shall apply as to both streets except that in the event the side street is local, nonconnector street, then the administrator shall have the authority to reduce the side street setback to not less than the standard side setback line. 
                  No building or structure shall be located closer than fifteen (15) feet to any side or rear property line; provided, however, the side and rear setback lines shall be as provided in the restrictive covenants of subdivisions, but in no event less than 10 feet. Said setback lines shall also be reduced to 10 feet as to buildable lots of record with widths of less than 91 feet at the building line.

                  Sec. 6.3. - Special-use performance standards. 
                  This code is concerned with minimizing the adverse effects on adjoining property of marginal types of land and structure uses rather than designating specific areas in which these uses may locate. Therefore, special performance standards are hereby established for these marginal uses to ensure that the adverse effects characteristics of each type of use are minimized. 
                  For the purposes of this code, these standards are considered the minimum conditions necessary to protect and preserve public health, safety, convenience, order, and general welfare, and to allow marginal uses to perform their particular function compatibly within areas containing or which could contain uses with which such functions could otherwise be considered incompatible. 
                  Unless modified by grant or hardship variance, these standards shall apply, in addition to those of DIVISION 6.2 of this code and are hereby declared to be the minimum requirements for designated uses of land and structures within the unincorporated limits of the county. However, no use of land shall be forced to be changed if the city grows to within said 300 feet of a business, industrial, agricultural or other activity, as specified in sections 6.3.1 through 6.3.18 below.

                  b.)	If all of the privately owned property within the city limits which lies within three hundred feet of the subject property is zoned commercial, then the subject property may be used for those uses allowed in that commercial zone and uses provided in all more restrictive zones, provided the setback line from any existing detached single family residence in the unincorporated area shall be 50 feet; and 
                  c.)	If part of the privately owned property within the city limits which lies within three hundred feet of the subject property is zone residential and part is zoned commercial, then the subject property may be used for those uses allowed in the commercial zone and uses provided in all more restrictive zones only if the subject property lies adjacent to or within one hundred feet of the property zoned commercial and provided further that the setback line from any existing site-built detached single family residence shall be 100 feet; and 
                  d.)	The 100 foot and 50 foot minimum set backs provided for in this paragraph may be waived by the owner of the property on which said residence(s) are located.

                  a.	Alteration or enlargement—A nonconforming building or structure shall not be altered or enlarged in any manner unless said building structure, including additions and expansion comply with the regulations of this article.

                  No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved in whole or in part to another location on the same lot or to any other lot unless every portion of said building or structure is made to conform to all applicable provisions of this article. 
                  b.	Discontinuance of use—After a nonconforming use shall have been discontinued for a period of two (2) years, it shall not be re-established or changed to any use except a conforming use.

                  c.	Damage to structures—Any nonconforming structure or structure containing a nonconforming use which has been damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or other causes to the extent of sixty (60) percent of its fair market value shall not be repaired or reconstructed except in conformity with this article. 
                  d.	Maintenance and repairs—On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months or work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten (10) percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or nonconforming position of the structure, provided that the total floor area existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.

                  ARTICLE 8. - APPEALS, MODIFICATIONS AND VARIANCES 

                  Sec. 8.1. - Modifications. 
                  Modification of the design standards set forth in these regulations may be authorized by the administrator in specific cases when, in his opinion, undue hardship may result from strict compliance; provided any such determination shall be based fundamentally on the fact that unusual topographical or other exceptional conditions require such modification, or that the granting of the modification will not adversely affect the general public welfare or nullify the intent of these regulations. Any such modification granted shall be made in writing to the applicant and also made a part of the county's records. Application for any modifications shall be filed in writing on a form provided by the county with necessary supporting documents and shall explain in detail the reasons and facts supporting the application. 
                  Sec. 8.2. - Variances. 
                  Variance requests from the requirements of these regulations shall be submitted on an application form as provided by the county, along with such fees as shall be established and which may be amended by the board of commissioners from time-to-time. The administrator shall coordinate the review of each variance request by all other affected county departments and shall summarize such comments or recommendations as may be received. In the event the administrator shall decline to grant the variance then he shall provide all information gathered to the planning commission, together with a summary of his reasons for refusing the request. The administrator is authorized to grant minor variances based upon the criteria provided herein. Minor variances are defined herein as variances of up to 25% of the code requirements as to all code requirements except those set out in section 6.3 herein. Minor variances as to section 6.3 are defined as variances of up to 10% of the code requirements. 
                  Sec. 8.3. - Appeals. 
                  8.3.1	Administrator and planning commission. Appeals of the interpretation of the administrator of the requirements of these regulations or appeals from his refusal to grant a modification or a variance shall first be submitted in writing to the planning commission who shall review the request in a timely manner and receive comments from other affected departments. The appeal shall be forwarded to the planning commission for final action in their normal course of business. 
                  8.3.2	Planning commission, duties and power. The planning commission shall have the power to hear and decide the following types of appeals and applications and to such end shall have the necessary authority to ensure continuing compliance with its decisions. 
                  a.	Interpretation - To render an interpretation of this article and the manner of its application where it is alleged that there is error in any order, requirement, or determination made by the administrator in the administration of such provisions. 
                  In reaching its decision, the planning commission shall establish firm guidelines for future administrative actions on similar or like manners. 
                  b.	Variance - To authorize upon an appeal in specific cases such variance from this article as will not be contrary to the intent of this code, nor detrimental to the public interest and welfare. Variances from the terms of this article may be granted on appeal by the planning commission if it finds: 
                  1.	That the literal enforcement of this article will create an unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty in the development of the affected property, except 
                  2.	That mere loss in property value shall not justify a variance—there must be a deprivation of a reasonable, beneficial use of land; and 
                  3.	That the situation causing the hardship or difficulty is neither self-imposed nor generally affecting all or most properties within the general vicinity; and 
                  4.	That the relief sought will not injure the permitted use of adjacent conforming property; and will not unreasonably reduce the fair market value of any adjacent property. 
                  5.	That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the spirit and purposes of these codes; and 
                  6.	In no event will a business or other commercial use be allowed any closer to an existing residence or residential subdivision without notice of the public hearing being provided in writing by certified mail to all owners located within the code required setback specified in these codes; unless such a variance would constitute a minor variance as defined in paragraph 8.2. 
                  7.	In reviewing an appeal for variance, the burden of showing that the variance should be granted shall be the responsibility of the party applying for the variance. Any variance granted by the planning commission shall terminate automatically when the use ceases to be in full compliance with any conditions imposed by the planning commission, when the use has been abandoned, or when the building permit shall have expired. 
                  8.	Any additional factors set forth in section 8.3.7. 
                  8.3.3	Application for appeal to planning commission. A request for an interpretation of this article or an appeal for variance from its terms may be taken by any person, firm, or corporation aggrieved, or by any officer, department, or board of the county, affected by a decision or order of the administrator. Such appeal shall be taken within fifteen (15) days time after the decision has been rendered by filing with the administrator and the planning commission a notice of appeal specifying the grounds therefor. The administrator shall forthwith transmit to the planning commission all papers constituting the record regarding the action appealed. 
                  Any appeal or application may be withdrawn upon written notice to the administrator and the planning commission but no appeal shall be withdrawn after a notice of public hearing has been posted without the written consent of the planning commission. 
                  8.3.4	Public hearing. Upon receipt of a request for appeal proceedings, the planning commission shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of an appeal and shall give, or cause to be given to the Appellant notice of the date and time of the hearing. Appellant shall give, or cause to be given, a public notice thereof by means of a notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the county at least fifteen (15) days prior to the scheduled date of the hearing. In the event the appeal concerns article six hereof, then appellant shall also provide written notice of said hearing by personal delivery of noticed or delivery by certified mail, return receipt requested, to all property owners who are adjacent to the property under appeal and to all property owners who fall within any questioned residential set back distances. Such notices shall be delivered so as to provide not less than 10 days advance notice of the hearing. The appellant shall provide evidence of substantial compliance with the notice requirements to the planning commission. 
                  Said notice shall contain the time, date, and place of the hearing and a general statement as to the nature of the appeal request, the location of the property affected, if any, as well as the name of the appellant. Public hearings shall be governed by policies and procedures set forth in section 8.3.6. 
                  8.3.5	Decision of planning commission. The planning commission shall decide upon an appeal request within thirty (30) days after the date of the public hearing. 
                  a.	Findings of fact - Every decision of the planning commission shall be based upon findings of fact and every finding of fact shall be supported in a record of the proceedings. The enumerated conditions required to exist on any matter upon which the planning commission is authorized to pass under this section shall be construed as limitations on the power of the planning commission to act. 
                  b.	Approval of request - In approving any request the planning commission may designate such conditions in connection therewith in order to secure substantially the objectives of the regulation or provision to which such variance is granted and to provide adequately for the maintenance of the integrity and character of the area in which permit is granted. 
                  c.	Denial of request - No appeal or application for appeal that has been denied shall be further considered by the planning commission until a subsequent request is obtained by filing of new plans and a decision rendered thereon by the administrator. 
                  Appeals from decision of the planning commission. Any person or persons, jointly or separately aggrieved by any decision of the planning commission may present to the county commissioners an appeal, following the procedures set out for an initial appeal. Such petition shall be presented to the county clerk/administrator within ten (10) working days after the rendering of the decision by the planning commission and not thereafter, unless an extension be granted by the county commission. 
                  Appeals from decision of the county commission. Any person or persons, jointly or separately aggrieved by any decision of the county commission may present to the superior court, a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of such illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within ten (10) working days after the rendering of the decision by the county commission and not there after, unless an extension be granted by either the county commission or a judge of superior court. 
                  8.3.6	Policies and procedures governing the calling and conducting of public hearings. 
                  Whenever Baldwin County proposes to take any action resulting in a zoning decision as defined in O.C.G.A. Chapter 36-66 it shall provide for a public hearing on the proposed action. At least fifteen (15), but not more than forty five (45), days prior to the date of the hearing, Baldwin County shall cause to be published within a newspaper of general circulation within the territorial boundaries of Baldwin County a notice of the hearing. The notice shall state the time, place, and purpose of the hearing. Substantial compliance with this requirement shall satisfy this procedure for calling and conducting public hearings, so long as all of the requirements of said chapter 36-66 are complied with. 
                  Policies 
                  It is the policy of Baldwin County that public hearings shall be conducted in such manner as to afford the most complete public input possible. The person conducting the meeting shall announce at the beginning of the meeting any limitations that may be required due to the nature of the issues or the number of persons appearing. The policy shall be that if time and numbers permit any person who indicates a desire to speak to the issues be given a reasonable opportunity to do so. If the numbers of persons attending indicate the need, then the person conducting the meeting may request that those persons desiring to speak sign a roster for that purpose. It is the policy of the county to request that any group that appears be represented by a spokesperson who will be recognized to present the position of the group. Any speakers who follow will be requested to address only issues not previously covered or positions not previously stated. Personal attacks, interruptions of the recognized speaker, inappropriate language, and remarks which extend beyond a reasonable time will not be allowed. 
                  8.3.7	Standards for evaluation. Before enacting an amendment to this ordinance the board of commissioners (or planning commission as to variances, modifications, and recommendations for amendments) shall consider the following standards in evaluating such requests or proposals as factors relevant in balancing the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare against the right to the unrestricted use of property. 
                  1.	Existing uses in the neighborhood and of nearby property; 
                  2.	The extent to which the destruction of property values of the applicants promotes the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public; 
                  3.	The extent to which property values are diminished by the particular restrictions; 
                  4.	The relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship imposed upon the individual property owner; 
                  5.	The suitability of the subject property for the allowed purposes.

                  ARTICLE 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

                  Sec. A. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners, of Baldwin, Georgia, does ordain as follows. 
                  (Ord. of 7-20-2010) 
                  Sec. B. - Findings of fact. 
                  (1)	The flood hazard areas of Baldwin County, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (2)	These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 7-20-2010) 
                  Sec. C. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  (4)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  (5)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. of 7-20-2010) 
                  Sec. D. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this ordinance are: 
                  (1)	To protect human life and health; 
                  (2)	To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)	To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)	To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)	To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)	To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  (7)	To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

                  This ordinance shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Baldwin County, Georgia. 
                  (Ord. of 7-20-2010) 
                  Sec. B. - Basis for area of special flood hazard. 
                  The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS), dated December 17, 2010, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this ordinance. 
                  For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation the current effective FIS dated December 17, 2010, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, for (Baldwin County) are hereby adopted by reference. 
                  Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS. (*Specifically identify*) 
                  The Repository for public inspection of the Flood Insurance Study (FIS), accompanying maps and other supporting data is located: 121 N. Wilkinson Street, Suite 314, Milledgeville GA 31061.

                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)	New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of Article 4, Section A(4), "elevated buildings". 
                  (a)	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)	Nonresidential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE or AH zone, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in Article 3, Section C(6). 
                  (3)	Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  (a)	All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
                  (1)	Individual lots or parcels, 
                  (2)	In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, 
                  (3)	In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or 
                  (4)	On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (b)	Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  (i)	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
                  (ii)	The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  (c)	All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. Article 4(A)(6) above) 
                  (d)	All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  (i)	Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
                  (ii)	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
                  (iii)	The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "New Construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of Article 4, Section B (3)(a)(c), above. 
                  (4)	Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Article 2, Section B, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  (a)	Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  (b)	Only if Article 4(B)(4)(a) above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article 4.

                  (1)	When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with Article 2(B), then the Code Enforcement Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of Article 4. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply: 
                  (2)	No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)	In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-Zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of Article 4, Section A(4) "elevated buildings". 
                  (a)	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.

                  (A)	The Planning Commission (Appeal Board) as established by Baldwin County shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this ordinance. 
                  (B)	The Planning Commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Code Enforcement Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance. 
                  (C)	Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Planning Commission may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Baldwin County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
                  (D)	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of Historic Structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a Historic Structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (E)	Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (F)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (G)	In reviewing such requests, the Planning Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this ordinance. 
                  (H)	Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)	A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  (i)	A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
                  (ii)	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; 
                  (iii)	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)	The provisions of this ordinance are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a Historic Structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)	The Code Enforcement Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (I)	Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the Planning Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance.

                  "Floodproofing," means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  "Historic Structure" means any structure that is: 
                  a.	Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
                  b.	Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;

                  "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this code. 
                  "Manufactured home" means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.

                  "National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD)" as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  *"New construction" means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after January 3, 1990 [the effective date of the initial FIRM] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after May 17, 1978 [the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  *"New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after May 17, 1978 [the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
                  "North American Vertical Datum (NAVD)" has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA Flood Modernization Maps. 
                  "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle, which is: 
                  a.	Built on a single chassis;

                  d.	Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  "Start of construction" means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: Accessory structures are NOT exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  "Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  "Subdivision" the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the Code Enforcement Official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
                  "Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions" is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  "Variance" is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance. 
                  "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  3.	Such minor land-disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion; 
                  4.	The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre and not otherwise exempted under this paragraph; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and this paragraph. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this paragraph, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b) and the buffer zones provided by this paragraph shall be enforced by the Local Issuing Authority;

                  6.	Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt forestry practices cause or result in land-disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in paragraphs (15) and (16) of Section IV C. of this ordinance, no other land-disturbing activities, except for normal forest management practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period of three years after completion of such forestry practices; 
                  7.	Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture; 
                  8.	Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within 200 feet of the bank of any state waters, and for purposes of this paragraph, "state waters" excludes channels and drainage ways which have water in them only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water in them year-round; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre, which involves land-disturbing activity, and which is within 200 feet of any such excluded channel or drainage way, must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which such project is located and provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the local issuing authority from regulating any such project which is not specifically exempted by paragraph 1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 9. or 10. of this section; 
                  9.	Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the Department of Transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the State Road and Tollway Authority; or any road construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided, however, that construction or maintenance projects of the Department of Transportation or the State Road and Tollway Authority which disturb one or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to provisions of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7.1; except where the Department of Transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the State Road and Tollway Authority is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case a copy of a notice of intent under the state general permit shall be submitted to the Local Issuing Authority, the Local Issuing Authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; 
                  10.	Any land-disturbing activities conducted by any electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power; except where an electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United states engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case the Local Issuing Authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; and

                  (Ord. of 4-20-2010) 
                  Sec. IV. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  A.	General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this ordinance shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of Sections IV B. and C. of this ordinance. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES General Permit. 
                  B.	Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  1.	Best management practices as set forth in Section IV B. and C. of this ordinance shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the Director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  2.	A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the Director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land-disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than 5 acres. 
                  3.	Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a Local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to Code § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  4.	The Director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
                  5.	The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in [subsections] C.15. and 16., in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  C.	The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  1.	Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  2.	Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  3.	Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  4.	Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  5.	The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  6.	Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  7.	Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  8.	Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  9.	To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  10.	Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  11.	Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  12.	Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  13.	Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  14.	Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in Section IV B.2. of this ordinance; 
                  15.	Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the Director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the Director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water, and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  16.	There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The Director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  D.	Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any Local Issuing Authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in Sections IV B. and C. of this ordinance. 
                  E.	The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. of 4-20-2010) 
                  Sec. V. - Application/permit process. 
                  A.	General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The Local Issuing Authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Local Issuing Authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  B.	Application requirements. 
                  1.	No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Baldwin County without first obtaining a permit from the Code Enforcement Office to perform such activity and providing a copy of Notice of Intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  2.	The application for a permit shall be submitted to the Code Enforcement Office and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in Section V C. of this ordinance. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of Section IV B. and C. of this ordinance will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by 3 copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  3.	A fee of $40.00 shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
                  4.	In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land-disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a Local Issuing Authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  5.	Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the Local Issuing Authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the Local Issuing Authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by Section IV C. 15. and 16. has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per Section V B. 7, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the Local Issuing Authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the Local Issuing Authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The Local Issuing Authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the Local Issuing Authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  6.	If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this ordinance section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the Local Issuing Authority may deny the permit application. 
                  7.	The Local Issuing Authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the Local Issuing Authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the Local Issuing Authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  C.	Plan requirements. 
                  1.	Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in Section IV B. and C. of this ordinance, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this ordinance. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and State laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the Commission and in consultation with the Division and the Stakeholder Advisory Board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  2.	Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Plan Review Checklist established by the Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  D.	Permits. 
                  1.	Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the Local Issuing Authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  2.	No permit shall be issued by the Local Issuing Authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the District and the Local Issuing Authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this ordinance, any variances required by Section IV C.15. and 16. are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per Section V B.7 are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Local Issuing Authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  3.	Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this ordinance, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  4.	If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  5.	The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the Local Issuing Authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this ordinance. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  6.	The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Ord. of 4-20-2010) 
                  Sec. VI. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  A.	The Code Enforcement Office will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the Local Issuing Authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this ordinance, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this ordinance. 
                  B.	The Local Issuing Authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  C.	The Code Enforcement Office shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this ordinance, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  D.	No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the Local Issuing Authority, the commission, the district or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  E.	The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as Local Issuing Authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  F.	The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as Local Issuing Authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a Local Issuing Authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a Local Issuing Authority. 
                  (Ord. of 4-20-2010) 
                  Sec. VII. - Penalties and incentives. 
                  A.	Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this ordinance without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the Local Issuing Authority. 
                  B.	Stop-work orders. 
                  1.	For the first and second violations of the provisions of this ordinance, the director or the Local Issuing Authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the Local Issuing Authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the Local Issuing Authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  2.	For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the Local Issuing Authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; 
                  3.	All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; and 
                  4.	When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the Local Issuing Authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop-work order shall be issued by the Local Issuing Authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop-work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  C.	Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this ordinance and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of Section V B. 7. The Local Issuing Authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance.

                  1.	Any person who violates any provisions of this ordinance, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this ordinance, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this ordinance shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this ordinance, notwithstanding any provisions in any City Charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation.

                  Sec. VIII. - Education and certification. 
                  A.	All persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspection or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on their level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  B.	For each site on which land-disturbing activity occurs, each entity or person acting as either a primary, secondary, or tertiary permittee, as defined in the state general permit, shall have as a minimum one person who is in responsible charge of erosion and sedimentation control activities on behalf of said entity or person and meets the applicable education or training certification requirements developed by the Commission present on site whenever land-disturbing activities are conducted on that site. A project site shall herein be defined as any land-disturbance site or multiple sites within a larger common plan of development or sale permitted by an owner or operator for compliance with the state general permit. 
                  C.	Persons or entities involved in projects not requiring a state general permit but otherwise requiring certified personnel on site may contract with certified persons to meet the requirements of this ordinance. 
                  D.	If a state general permittee who has operational control of land-disturbing activities for a site has met the certification requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(1), then any person or entity involved in land-disturbing activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet those educational requirements specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(4) and shall not be required to meet any educational requirements that exceed those specified in said paragraph. 
                  (Ord. of 4-20-2010) 
                  Sec. IX. - Administrative appeal judicial review. 
                  A.	Administrative remedies. The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by the Local Issuing Authority upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sediment and pollution control plan; or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions; or that the holder is in violation of any ordinance; shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to a hearing before the Baldwin County Planning Commission within 30 days after receipt by the Local Issuing Authority of written notice of appeal. 
                  B.	Judicial review. Any person, aggrieved by a decision or order of the Local Issuing Authority, after exhausting his administrative remedies, shall have the right to appeal de novo to the Superior Court of Baldwin County.

                  B.	Validity. If any section, paragraph, clause, phrase, or provision of this ordinance shall be adjudged invalid or held unconstitutional, such decisions shall not affect the remaining portions of this ordinance. 
                  C.	Liability. 
                  1.	Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this ordinance, nor the compliance with provisions of this ordinance shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the Local Issuing Authority or District for damage to any person or property. 
                  2.	The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit. 
                  3.	No provision of this ordinance shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any Waters of the State as defined thereby.
