the board of commissioners finds: 
(1)  Adult establishments, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions, thereby increasing the risk of adverse secondary effects. 
(2)  Adult establishments should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other adult establishments, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of adult establishments in one area. 
(3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the county has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the county's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the county's interest in regulating adult establishments extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future adult establishments that may locate in the county. The county finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects. 
The county hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of adult establishments, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects.

Chapter 78 - SIGNS 

Sec. 78-1. - Findings and purpose. 
The board of commissioners finds that signs provide an important medium through which persons may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and to the county's general public welfare, as well as create an aesthetic nuisance. By enacting this chapter, the board of commissioners intends to: 
(1)  Balance the rights of persons to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
(2)  Protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens and others within the county; 
(3)  Reduce traffic hazards, pedestrian hazards, and other hazards; 
(4)  Promote and maintain the aesthetic qualities of the county; 
(5)  Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
(6)  Promote economic development; 
(7)  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations; 
(8)  Promote the stated purposes of the UDO, as amended, which are expressly incorporated herein; and 
(9)  Promote the stated purposes of the building code, as adopted and modified by the county, which are expressly incorporated herein.

(a)  Effective the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, oversized signs are prohibited. 
(b)  Oversized signs legally existing on such date may be continued, even though such signs do not conform to this section.

Sec. 78-18. - Reduction in number of oversized signs. 
(a)  Purpose. The board of commissioners finds that all oversized signs lawfully erected prior to the adoption of section 78-17 in unincorporated Gwinnett County are legal nonconforming uses. Consistent with the provisions of section 78-8 concerning nonconforming signs, it is the desire of the county that such nonconforming uses be permitted to continue, but that they be reduced over time. The board of commissioners further finds that the development of electronic oversized signs provides a valuable opportunity to enhance the utilization of existing signage within the county. Such electronic oversized signs must be properly regulated to ensure they do not constitute a traffic hazard or otherwise negatively impact the aesthetics of the county. Therefore, the board of commissioners finds that the modification of a limited number of existing legal nonconforming oversized signs to electronic oversized signs, in exchange for a reduction in the overall number of nonconforming oversized signs, constitutes a benefit to the county in regard to traffic safety and aesthetics. 
(b)  Exchange ratio and permitting. 
(1)  Oversized signs not located within 500 feet of a residence. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any existing legal nonconforming oversized sign face(s) or panel(s) existing on the date of adoption of this ordinance amendment and not located within 500 feet of a residence may be modified to an electronic oversized sign face(s) or panel(s). The applicant shall remove from within unincorporated Gwinnett County at least three other legal nonconforming oversized sign face(s) or panel(s) of equal or greater square footage to that sign being converted to an electronic sign. For the purposes of this subsection, in order to obtain credit for removal of only one side of two-sided sign, the entire sign structure must be removed during the exchange process. An existing legal nonconforming oversized sign face or panel modified to an electronic oversized sign face or panel pursuant to this subsection shall not be located within the distance of another oversized electronic sign as set forth in subsection (f)(4) of this section. 
(2)  Any legal nonconforming oversized sign face(s) or panel(s) existing on the date of adoption of this ordinance amendment that is located within 500 feet from a residence may be modified to an electronic sign face(s) or panel(s), in accordance with the provisions set forth in subsection (b)(1) of this section subject to approval by the board of commissioners as a special use permit pursuant to the provisions set forth in the county unified development ordinance, including, but not limited to, all applicable postings, certified mailings to residents within 500 feet and public hearing requirements. When determining the appropriateness of modifying an existing legal nonconforming oversized sign to an electronic oversized sign if located within 500 feet of a residence, the board of commissioners will consider factors including but not limited to whether or not the electronic sign face will be visible from the residence(s) that is within 500 feet; whether or not electronic sign faces visible from the residence(s) are properly buffered and screened from lighting cast from the sign; and whether or not there are other existing or changing conditions that would give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the requested modification. 
(c)  Determination criteria. In determining the exchange ratios set forth in subsection (b) of this section: 
(1)  Multiple sign panels may be combined to satisfy the necessary sign face or panel removals. For purposes of this subsection, in order to obtain credit for removal of only one side of a two-sided panel, the entire sign structure must be removed; 
(2)  Two sign faces or panels not less than 300 square feet shall equal one sign face or panel of 672 square feet in size; 
(3)  For purposes of the installation of an electronic sign face or panel 672 square feet in size, the applicant may remove six sign panels not less than 300 square feet in size to comply with the removal requirements; 
(4)  When signs are removed containing more faces or panels than necessary for a pending or current request to install an electronic sign face or panel, the applicant shall be entitled to utilize such extra sign face(s) or panel(s) toward future upgrade requests for not more than 24 months from removal. 
(d)  Eligibility criteria. In order to be eligible for exchange credit, the entire above-ground sign structure upon which the sign faces/panels to be exchanged are located must be removed. The applicant will not be issued a building permit to upgrade the designated sign to an electronic oversized sign until such time as the oversized signs designated in the application to be removed are actually removed, and the applicant otherwise shows compliance with the provisions of this section relating to electronic oversized signs. 
(e)  Construction. The final permit shall provide that except for the replacement of the sign face(s) with the electronic sign panel, and any associated structural improvements or reconstruction required by current building codes for such signs, the designated sign shall not be moved to another portion of the property, increased in size or height, or otherwise modified in a manner which increases the nonconformity of the structure unless a variance is first obtained to permit such modification. 
(f)  Regulation. In addition to the provisions of this chapter, each oversized electronic sign shall conform to the following: 
(1)  Each individual static message must be displayed for not less than ten seconds. 
(2)  Oversized electronic signs may not operate at brightness levels of more than 0.30 footcandles (under measurement conditions) above ambient light levels as measured at the following distances: 

 
(3)  Upon request of the director, the owner of said oversized electronic signs shall arrange for a certification of the light intensity showing compliance by an independent contractor and provide said certification to the director. 
(4)  No oversized electronic sign shall be located within 5,000 feet of another oversized electronic sign on the same side of the road (measured along the edge of right-of-way). 
(5)  Where located on a state-controlled route, each oversized electronic sign must comply with all state department of transportation rules and regulations applicable to electronic changeable message signs when not in conflict with this chapter. The stricter of the rules and regulations apply. 
(g)  Public service. Owners of oversized electronic signs are encouraged to coordinate with the local authorities to display, when appropriate, emergency information important to the traveling public, including, but not limited to, Amber Alerts or emergency management information.

Sec. 78-22. - Permit approval, denial or revocation. 
(a)  Procedure. 
(1)  An action by the department to approve or deny a sign permit shall be taken within 30 days of receipt of a complete sign permit application. Any sign permit application for which no action has been taken after 30 days or more shall be deemed to be approved. 
(2)  The director shall deny permit application(s) for signs that do not comply with the provisions of this chapter, incomplete applications, and applications containing any false material statements. A violation of any provision of this chapter and any other applicable state laws or county ordinances will be grounds for terminating a permit granted by the county for the erection of a sign. Should it be determined that a sign permit was issued pursuant to an incomplete application or an application containing a false material statement, or that a permit has been erroneously issued in violation of this chapter, the director shall revoke the permit. Should the director deny a permit, the reasons for the denial are to be stated in writing and mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address on the permit application, postmarked on or before the 30th business day after the director's receipt of the application, or by hand delivery to the applicant at time of denial. Any application denied and later resubmitted shall be deemed to have been submitted on the date of resubmission, not the date of the original submission. A permit shall not be denied or revoked except for due cause, being the violation of the provisions of this chapter, other applicable ordinances, state or federal law, or the submission of an incomplete application or an application containing false material statements. 
(b)  Appeal. A person whose permit application has been denied or a permittee whose permit has been revoked may appeal the decision of the director to the zoning board of appeals as provided. 
(c)  Certiorari. In the event a person whose permit has been denied or revoked is dissatisfied with the decision of the zoning board of appeals, they may petition for writ of certiorari to the superior court of the county as provided by law. 
(Code 1994, § 86-119; Res. No. A-01-004, 8-28-2001) 
Sec. 78-23. - Variances. 
Where a literal application of this chapter, due to special circumstances, would result in an unusual hardship in an individual case, a variance may be granted by the zoning board of appeals pursuant to procedures set forth, including, but not limited to: 
(1)  Exceptional conditions pertaining to the property where the sign is to be located as a result of its size, shape, or topography, which are not applicable to other lands or structures in the area. 
(2)  The applicant would be deprived of rights that are commonly enjoyed by others similarly situated. 
(3)  Granting the variance would not confer on the applicant any significant privileges which are denied to others similarly situated. 
(4)  The exceptional circumstances are not the result of action by the applicant. 
(5)  The requested variance is the minimum variance necessary to allow the applicant to enjoy the rights commonly enjoyed by others similarly situated. 
(6)  Granting of the variance would not violate more than one standard of this chapter. 
(7)  Granting the variance would not result in allowing a sign that interferes with road or highway visibility or obstruct or otherwise interfere with the safe and orderly movement of traffic. 
(Code 1994, § 86-120; Res. No. A-01-004, 8-28-2001)

(3)  The county may seek affirmative equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to cause the removal or repair of any sign in violation of this or other county ordinances. 
(4)  The director or his designee may remove any sign or structure illegally placed upon a public right-of-way without any notice and may dispose of said sign or structure by taking it to any landfill. Such removal and disposal of illegally placed signs shall not preclude the prosecution of any person for illegally placing such signs in the public right-of-way.

The board of commissioners declares that it would have enacted the remaining parts of this chapter if it had known that such portion thereof would be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional. The board of commissioners declares its intent that should this chapter be declared invalid in part or in whole, signs are to be subject to regulations applicable to structures contained in other ordinances, including the zoning resolution.

The incorporation of this revised work plan into the overall project schedule is not intended to correct errors and omissions with the originally approved Work Plan submitted to the department. If such errors or omissions occur, it will be the Utility's responsibility to adhere to the original work plan submitted and approved during the preconstruction phase of the project's development. However, when it is deemed appropriate for a revised Work Plan to be submitted the following procedure shall be followed for its approval: 
"It is the responsibility of the County department of transportation director or his/her designee to review all revised Work Plans submitted by the Utility found within a project's limits.

"Escalation Process Step 1 - It shall be the Contractor's responsibility to coordinate and track each Utility's progress in relation to the Work Plan or Revised Work Plan previously approved by the County department of transportation director or his/her designee. Once the Contractor has determined that the Utility's work progress is at least 20% behind the approved Work Plan, the Contractor will notify the Utility and the department of such apparent delay through written correspondence. Such written correspondence shall detail the delay in question and request the Utility to submit a proposal on how the Utility plans to rectify such delay and maintain the project's schedule prescribed by the previously approved Work Plan. The Utility will respond to this letter within 10 business days. The response shall include a proposal to cure the delay identified by the department's Contractor. In some cases, the complexity of the project may require that a utility coordination meeting be held to address the issues identified by the department's Contractor. If the Utility determines that this is the case, then the Utility's response letter shall include a request to hold a utility coordination meeting with the department's Contractor and the County department of transportation for utility delay resolution. If the utility delay dispute cannot be resolved through the coordination efforts described above after 20 business days from the date provided in the Contractor's original written correspondence, said dispute may be escalated for further consideration as provided in Escalation Process Step 2 below." 
"Escalation Process Step 2 - After the County department of transportation director or his/her designee has reviewed and determined that the submitted Work Plan is unreasonable for the proposed utility work in question, the County department of transportation director or his/her designee will notify the Utility of such determination through written correspondence. Such written correspondence shall detail the items in question and request the Utility to justify or revise the Work Plan accordingly. The Utility will respond to this letter within 10 business days. The response shall include justification or proposed revisions to comply with the items in question identified by the County department of transportation director or his/her designee. If the Work Plan dispute cannot be resolved through the efforts described above after 20 business days from the date provided in the department of transportation's original written correspondence, said dispute may be escalated by the department of transportation director or his/her designee or the Utility to the Director of the department of transportation and a designated representative of the Utility who has authority to settle the dispute and who is at a higher level of management than the person with direct responsibility for the management of the project. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute, either party may select relief from such other remedies as may be available at law or in equity. The Utility shall have a period of 45 days from the date of receipt of the department of transportation's original written correspondence to either pay the amount of the damages or delay costs to the department or its Contractor or seek relief from this determination by available legal or equitable remedy".

In the event the taxpayer desires a conference or hearing before the licensing and revenue manager in connection with any claim for a refund, the taxpayer shall so specify in writing in the claim. The claim shall be audited and shall be made on forms provided by the licensing and revenue manager. If the claim is approved by the licensing and revenue manager and the board, the excess amount collected or paid may be refunded or may be credited on any amounts then due and payable from the person from whom it was collected or by whom paid. The balance may be refunded to this person, his administrators or executors.

(2)  No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months; 
(3)  The user shall submit a progress report to the director no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance, including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
(4)  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the director. 
(c)  Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the director a report containing the information described in section 106-128(f)(1)g and h and subsection (a)(2)b of this section. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures specified in this division this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with this division. All sampling will be conducted in conformance with the sample collection requirements specified by this division. 
(d)  Periodic compliance reports. All individual permittees are required to submit periodic compliance reports even if they have been designated a non-significant IU. 
(1)  Except as otherwise specified by permits, all SIUs must submit monthly reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required by the director or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. 
(2)  All non-significant IUs with individual permits must submit reports at the frequency set by the permit, but not less than twice annually, indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and/or the permit and the measured or estimated monthly average daily flows for the reporting period. 
(3)  All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with this division. 
(4)  All wastewater samples taken by the user must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(5)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the director, using the procedures prescribed herein under sample collection, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(e)  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the director of any significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days before the change. 
(1)  The director may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application. 
(2)  The director may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit or a general permit in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(f)  Reports of potential problems. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the director of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(2)  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this division. 
(3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (f)(1) of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(4)  SIUs are required to notify the director immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge. 
(g)  Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit shall provide appropriate reports to the director as the director may require. 
(h)  Notice of violation by the user/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation; such resampling shall be in addition to routine sampling as required by the permit. 
(i)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. The discharge of waste which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261 to the POTW is prohibited unless expressly permitted by the director in writing in advance of such discharge. The director reserves the right to refuse acceptance of any waste, including hazardous waste. 
(1)  If such an exception is granted by the director, the user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes; an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month; and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted in accordance with this division. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections (a), (c) and (d) of this section. 
(2)  If such an exception is granted by the director, dischargers may be exempt from the requirements of subsection (i)(1) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  If such an exception is granted by the director, in the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this division, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(j)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the director or other parties approved by EPA. 
(k)  Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
(1)  Except as indicated in subsections (k)(2) and (3) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the director. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by DWR, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by DWR, as appropriate. In addition, individual grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(3)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in subsections (a) and (c) of this section per 40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the director may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by periodic compliance reports as specified by this division and per 40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h), the IU is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(l)  Date of receipt of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(m)  Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this division shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this division, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with BMPs. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or DWR, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the director. 
(n)  Certification statements. Permit applications, user reports and initial monitoring waivers require the following certification statement to be signed and submitted by users submitting any of the following documents: permit applications; BMRs; reports on compliance with the categorical pretreatment standard; and periodic compliance reports. The following certification statement must be signed by an authorized representative as defined in this division: 
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations. 
(Code 1994, § 114-96; Ord. No. SWR-2010-001, 11-16-2010) 
Sec. 106-131. - Compliance monitoring. 
(a)  Right of entry; inspection and sampling. The director shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this division and any individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the director ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(1)  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the director shall be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(2)  The director shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
(3)  The director may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy. 
(4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the director and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. 
(5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the director access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this division. 
(b)  Sampling manhole. The location of the monitoring facility shall provide ample room in or near the monitoring facility to allow convenient and accurate sampling and preparation of samples and analysis and, whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the director's requirements and all applicable county construction standards and specifications, and such facilities shall be constructed and maintained in such manner so as to enable the director to perform independent monitoring activities. In addition, SIUs shall comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  All existing source and new source SIUs shall provide a sampling manhole for accurate sampling and measurement of industrial wastewater. A large sampling manhole shall be provided, at the SIUs expense, on its building sewers conveying industrial wastewater. A large sampling manhole or sampling chamber shall be located outside the plant. If inside the plant fence, there shall be a gate near the sampling manhole with a key furnished to DWR and which allows access from public rights-of-way or easement. In certain sampling manholes where noxious fumes may accumulate, DWR may require a fume exhaust system to protect the life and health of county employees who may be required to enter the sampling manhole. The fume exhaust system should extract the fumes from the bottom of the manhole and provide not less than one air change per minute. The sampling manhole shall include a 120V single phase electrical outlet at or near the installation. 
(2)  For new source SIUs, each sampling manhole shall contain a properly installed flow monitoring device such as a parshall flume, palmer-bowlus flume or other similar device approved by the county. Plans of the proposed sampling manhole and monitoring device shall be prepared by a registered engineer and submitted to the county for review and approval. The director may require the industrial user to install additional equipment necessary to measure, record, and total flow. This equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition. Devices used to measure wastewater flow shall be calibrated periodically, but not less frequently than annually, to ensure their accuracy. Records of this calibration must be kept for a period of three years and submitted to DWR upon request. 
(c)  Search warrants. If the director has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this division, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of DWR designed to verify compliance with this division or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, the director may seek issuance of a search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(Code 1994, § 114-97; Ord. No. SWR-2010-001, 11-16-2010) 
Sec. 106-132. - Confidential information. 
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, individual wastewater discharge permits, general permits, and monitoring programs, and from the director's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as defined at 40 CFR 2.302 shall not be recognized as confidential information and shall be available to the public without restriction. 
(Code 1994, § 114-98; Ord. No. SWR-2010-001, 11-16-2010) 
Sec. 106-133. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
The director shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of the users which, at any time during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance (SNC) with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "SNC" shall be applicable to all SIUs, or any other IU that violates subsection (3), (4) or (8) of this section, and shall mean: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits; 
(2)  Technical review criteria violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits, as multiplied by the applicable criteria. The applicable criteria are 1.4 for BOD 5 , TSS, FOG, NH 3 -N, Phosphorus and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH; 
(3)  Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the director determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
(4)  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the director's exercise of his emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date, any required reports, including BMRs, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of BMPs or BMRs, which the director determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Code 1994, § 114-99; Ord. No. SWR-2010-001, 11-16-2010) 
Sec. 106-134. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 14 days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the director. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(b)  Consent orders. The director may enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as administrative orders issued in accordance with this division and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The director may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 14 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(d)  Compliance orders. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(e)  Cease and desist orders. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(f)  Administrative fines. 
(1)  When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
(2)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of ten percent per month. A lien against the user's property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
(3)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the director to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within 14 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the director may convene an administrative hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The director may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
(4)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(g)  Emergency suspensions. 
(1)  The director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
a.  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless termination proceedings are initiated against the user. 
b.  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing. 
(2)  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(h)  Termination of discharge. 
(1)  In addition to the provisions in all other sections of this division, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
a.  Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit or general permit conditions; 
b.  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
c.  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
d.  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
e.  Violation of the pretreatment standards. 
(2)  Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Code 1994, § 114-100; Ord. No. SWR-2010-001, 11-16-2010) 
Sec. 106-135. - Judicial enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Injunctive relief. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may petition the appropriate court through the county's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit order, or other requirement imposed by this division on activities of the user. The director may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(b)  Civil penalties. 
(1)  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this division, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the county for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
(2)  The director may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the county and DWR. 
(3)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(4)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(c)  Criminal prosecution. 
(1)  A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this division, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or a general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 60 days, or both. 
(2)  A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of at least $1,000.00 or be subject to imprisonment for not more than 60 days, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. 
(3)  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this division, individual wastewater discharge permit, or general permit or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this division shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 60 days, or both. 
(4)  In the event of a second conviction, a user shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 60 days, or both. 
(d)  Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this division are not exclusive. The director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the county's enforcement response plan. However, the director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.

Sec. 106-136. - Supplemental enforcement action. 
(a)  Penalties for late reports. A penalty may be assessed to any user for each day that a report required by this division, a permit or order issued hereunder is late, beginning five days after the date the report is due. Actions taken by the director to collect late reporting penalties shall not limit the director's authority to initiate other enforcement actions that may include penalties for late reporting violations. 
(b)  Performance bonds. The director may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit to any user or hauler who has failed to comply with any provision of this division, a previous individual wastewater discharge permit, or a previous general permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the county, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the director to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 
(c)  Payment of outstanding fees and penalties. The director may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater discharge permit or a general permit to any user who has failed to pay any outstanding fees, fines or penalties incurred as a result of any provision of this division, a previous individual wastewater discharge permit, or a previous general permit or order issued hereunder. 
(d)  Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this division, an individual wastewater discharge permit, a general permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will recommence, at the user's expense, only after the user has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
(e)  Public nuisances. A violation of any provision of this division, an individual wastewater discharge permit, a general permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the director. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of chapter 38 governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the county and/or DWR for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance. 
(f)  Contractor listing. Users which have not achieved compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are not eligible to receive a contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the county.

Sec. 106-137. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  CIU upset. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (3) of this section are met. 
(3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset: 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(5)  Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(b)  Bypass. 
(1)  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (b)(3) and (4) of this section. 
(3)  Bypass notifications. 
a.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
b.  A user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(4)  Unavoidable bypass. 
a.  Bypassing is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless all of the following conditions pertain: 
1.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
2.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
3.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (b)(3) of this section. 
b.  The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (4)a of this section. 
(Code 1994, § 114-103; Ord. No. SWR-2010-001, 11-16-2010) 
Sec. 106-138. - Determination of wastewater volume. 
(a)  Sewer billing based on metered water consumption. Unless otherwise provided, the volume of wastewater delivered to the POTW will be based upon the quantity of water purchased from and metered by DWR. 
(b)  Sewer billing volumes from IUs. If the volume of water delivered to the POTW by an IU is greater or less than the volume purchased from the county, the IU shall demonstrate to the director such differences. If differences do exist in the opinion of the director, it shall be the obligation of the IU to install DWR-approved meters or other devices to determine the portion or quantity of wastewater delivered to the POTW. At locations readily accessible for meter reading by the county, separate water meters installed in the county right-of-way are preferred for measuring non-sewered IU consumptive water usage. The county may consider establishing a constant ratio, factor or percentage to be applied to the metered water quantity delivered by DWR in order to determine the waste delivered by the IU; determining, as well as justifying, the factor to DWR will be the responsibility of the IU. The value of this factor may be periodically reviewed for accuracy by DWR. Other methods may be established by DWR to estimate the quantity of wastewater released to the POTW by IUs which considers the amount of water consumed during different seasons. IUs which claim wastewater volumes to be inaccurately determined by these methods shall bear the expense of installing DWR-approved meters or wastewater flow measuring devices to estimate flows to the POTW more accurately. 
(c)  Sewer billing volumes from non-IUs. Sewer billing to non-IU accounts connected to sewer shall be based upon the volume of water measured by the water meter. 
(Code 1994, § 114-104; Ord. No. SWR-2010-001, 11-16-2010) 
Sec. 106-139. - Pretreatment and other sewer user fees and charges. 
(a)  General. DWR may adopt reasonable fees for recovery of costs of administering and operating the county's pretreatment program, the FOG program, and/or the POTW, which may include: 
(1)  Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications and permit renewals including the cost of processing such applications; 
(2)  Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures, including the cost of collecting and analyzing a user's discharge, resampling, and reviewing monitoring reports and certification statements submitted by users; 
(3)  Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
(4)  Fees for permitting holding tank waste haulers and fees for hauled waste disposal; 
(5)  DWR is authorized to set rates for high-strength wastewater surcharges based upon POTW O&M and debt service costs, and to collect the surcharge revenue thus generated, even when such wastewater concentrations exceed local limits. Surcharges for discharges exceeding local limits shall be in addition to enforcement actions as stated elsewhere in this division and payment of such do not constitute a defense against enforcement. 
a.  To calculate a FOG surcharge, the analytical results of any grab sample for FOG shall be deemed representative of the user's discharge for the entire billing period in which the sample is taken, unless additional samples are taken either by DWR or the user during the same billing period in which event the average of all FOG analytical results for that period shall be used to calculate the FOG surcharge for that period; 
b.  To calculate a surcharge on BOD 5 , TSS, NH 3 -N or Phosphorus, the analytical results of any composite sample for BOD 5 , TSS, NH 3 -N or Phosphorus shall be deemed representative of the user's discharge for the entire billing period in which sample is taken, unless additional samples are taken either by DWR or the user during the same billing period, in which event the average of each parameter's analytical results for that period shall be used to calculate the surcharge for that period; 
(6)  Fees for filing appeals; 
(7)  Fees for debris or plugs introduced into the POTW; and 
(8)  Fees to recover administrative and legal costs associated with the enforcement activity taken by the director to address IU noncompliance. 
(b)  Other financial requirements. DWR may adopt other financial requirements as DWR may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein, including fees to create incentives for compliance and bonds for waste haulers and/or hauled waste generators. These fees and bonding requirements relate solely to the matters covered by this division and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties chargeable by the county and DWR.

a.  The total cost incurred by the county to repair or replace facilities damaged as a result of the violation. 
b.  Any injury or damage to person or property or loss of services resulting from the violation. 
(2)  FOG surcharges. Any user discharging greater than 200 mg/l FOG as measured by any grab sample is subject to a high-strength surcharge in addition to other enforcement and penalties. 
(3)  Abnormal occurrences. If, in the judgment of the director, a user is causing or may cause water pollution to such an extent as to be or become dangerous to the public health, safety or welfare, the director may require such corrective measures as may be necessary for the protection of the public on an emergency basis, and shall have the power and authority to cause all operation of the user to cease until appropriate corrective measures have been taken by issuing an order to the owner or operator thereof directing the cessation of the operation, or by ordering the utility providing water service to the user to cease providing such service. 
(d)  Grease trap regulations for new food establishments. 
(1)  Grease trap requirements. All food establishments discharging wastewater containing FOG to the POTW shall install, operate, and maintain at their own expense a sufficiently sized grease trap necessary to achieve and maintain compliance as indicated below. Installation and maintenance shall conform to the current DWRSSS. 
a.  Outdoor grease traps. New food establishments shall have a grease trap as outlined in the DWRSSS. A size variance may be issued in an extreme case but shall be verified and documented by inspection. The size variance shall conform to DWRSSS size variance guidelines and is subject to approval by the director. All scullery sinks, mop sinks, floor drains, dishwashers, hub drains and open receptacles shall drain into the outside grease trap. 
b.  Outdoor grease trap design. Outdoor grease trap design and installation shall conform to the DWRSSS. The trap shall be located for easy access for user cleaning, pump-out, and official inspection. Dishwasher and food grinder wastewater should be discharged through a suitably sized solids interceptor prior to the emptying into the outdoor grease trap. 
c.  Indoor grease traps. All indoor grease trap design and installation shall conform to the DWRSSS. All scullery sinks shall discharge into an indoor grease trap. 
d.  Mechanical grease traps. Mechanically operated grease traps (Big Dipper, skimmers, etc.) may not be used by any user tied to the POTW collection system. 
e.  Prohibited discharge. It is prohibited to discharge the following materials into an indoor grease trap: 
1.  Wastewater with a temperature higher than 120 degrees Fahrenheit. 
2.  Acid or caustic trap cleaners. 
3.  Any discharge from a dishwasher without approval from the director. 
f.  Sampling point. To allow for observation, sampling, and measurement of wastewaters, a sampling point on the effluent discharge side of the grease trap, as required by the DWRSSS, shall be provided at the user's expense. The sampling point shall be maintained and kept safe and accessible to the county at all times. 
(2)  Variances. All users connected to the county sewage collection system shall install a minimum 1,500-gallon exterior grease interceptor. Variances may be granted if in the opinion of the director a limited amount of FOG will be discharged by the user during all aspects of their operation. If a variance is granted, a minimum of a 100-pound grease trap shall be installed along with an effluent test point that meets the testing requirements of the county grease program. If at any time the user exceeds the county discharge limit, the user may be required to upgrade to a minimum of a 1,500 gallon outdoor interceptor at the user's expense. A variance will not be granted if a dishwasher, grill, range top, fryers, or griddle is present, or if the food establishment processes meat. The user may also be subject to any fines or penalties associated with the illegal discharge at the discretion of the director. 
(e)  Grease trap regulations for existing food establishments. 
(1)  Upgrade. If a food establishment in existence prior to codification of this division has no grease trap or, as documented by inspection, it is determined that the current grease trap is insufficient for the volume of food service waste being treated, the director may require that the establishment upgrade to an adequately sized grease trap and sampling point as outlined in this section. 
(2)  FOG best management practices (FOG BMPs). In order to enhance the overall efficiency of the grease trap, food establishments should implement FOG BMPs to reduce FOG and solids loading to their grease trap. Examples of FOG BMPs are: 
a.  Scraping food from pots, pans, plates and utensils into a garbage can; 
b.  Installation of a solid waste interceptor; 
c.  Pre-washing plates by spraying them off with cold water over a small mesh catchbasin positioned over a drain. The catchbasin should be cleaned into a garbage can as needed; and 
d.  Pouring all liquid grease and oil from pots and pans into a waste grease bucket stored at the pot-washing sink. Heavy solids buildup of oil and grease on pots and pans should be scraped off into the waste grease bucket. 
(f)  Grease trap maintenance. All grease traps shall be maintained by the owner so as to be in continuously efficient operation. Maintenance shall include the complete removal of all contents by a properly licensed waste hauler. Top skimming, decanting or back flushing of the grease trap or its waste is prohibited. Further, the discharge of liquid, semi-solids, or solids into a grease trap from vehicles after servicing is prohibited. Vehicles capable of separating water from grease shall not discharge separated water into the grease trap or into the wastewater collection system. Cleaning and maintenance of all grease traps shall include removal of materials from the tank walls, baffles, cross pipes, inlets and outlets, both tee's and the cover. Recyclable fats, oils and greases shall not be discharged into the POTW. Any violation in the removal of grease waste shall result in prosecution under state law. Maintenance shall be performed at frequencies as required by subsections (f)(1) and (2) of this section. 
(1)  Outdoor grease interceptor. Maintenance shall be performed at intervals of not less than once every 90 days and as required by the 30 percent rule, as follows: The depth of both bottom solids and oil/grease in a trap shall not equal or be greater than 30 percent of the total operating depth of the trap; the operating depth of a trap is the internal depth from the inlet or outlet water elevation to the bottom of the trap. Any solids interceptor should be emptied and cleaned daily. Outdoor grease interceptors shall have a minimum of 1,500-gallon capacity. 
(2)  Indoor grease trap. Maintenance shall be performed at intervals not less than once every 30 days. A variance is required to operate an indoor grease trap in place of a 1,500-gallon minimum outdoor interceptor. Indoor grease traps shall have a minimum of 100 pound capacity. Any current user connected to the county sewage collection system that currently operates an indoor grease trap, regardless of size, shall prove to the satisfaction of the director that they are not discharging illegally or the user shall be required to upgrade to a 1,500-gallon minimum outdoor grease interceptor. Users may not operate indoor grease traps with a capacity less than 100 pounds. A solids interceptor tied to an indoor grease trap should be emptied and cleaned daily. 
(3)  Pumping variance. Variances may be granted if the user can prove at their expense to the director's satisfaction that the discharge from the user's grease trap or interceptor is meeting the county's discharge limit up to 180 consecutive days for outdoor grease interceptors or 120 consecutive days for indoor grease traps. 
(4)  Additives. It is specifically prohibited to use any additive, such as enzymes, chemicals, or bacteria, as a substitute for grease trap maintenance. The direct addition of such additives to a grease trap is also prohibited. 
(5)  Waste removal. The user shall be responsible for the proper removal and legal disposal of the grease trap waste. All waste removed from each grease trap shall be tracked by an approved three-part manifest and the contents shall be disposed of at a facility permitted to receive such waste. In no manner shall any grease trap contents be discharged to the county sewer or stormwater system. 
(6)  Manifest transmittal. The user shall maintain a legible copy of the completed three-part manifest on site for each service event. Failure to provide all manifests for review by the county grease inspectors may result in a fine at the discretion of the director. 
(g)  Recordkeeping by user. It shall be a violation of this division for a user to allow the removal of their grease trap waste without documentation by an approved three-part manifest. The user shall be responsible for maintaining a copy of these manifests on site for a period of three years and subject to the director's review without prior notification. The manifest shall contain the information listed below: 
(1)  Food service establishment. 
a.  Facility name, address, and telephone number. 
b.  Trap type and size. 
c.  Date and volume removed from the trap. 
d.  Authorized signature (verifying the grease trap was cleaned and in operable condition). 
(2)  Service company information (waste hauler). 
a.  Pumper name, address, and telephone number. 
b.  Pumper permit number. 
c.  Date and volume removed from the trap. 
d.  Disposal method. 
e.  Authorized signature of pumper. 
(3)  Disposal site. 
a.  Facility name, address, and telephone number. 
b.  Facility EPD permit number. 
c.  Date and volume received. 
d.  Authorized signature verifying receipt of waste. 
(h)  Grease trap inspections by DWR. 
(1)  Inspection. Inspection of a grease trap shall be performed according to the "30 percent rule" as defined herein. 
(2)  Failed inspection. If a grease trap fails the initial inspection, the inspector may notify the user that the grease trap shall be cleaned out within seven calendar days. After seven calendar days, the grease trap should be re-inspected. 
(3)  Failed re-inspection. If at the first re-inspection, the grease trap is found to still be in noncompliance, a notice of violation may be issued and the user may be told that the grease trap shall be cleaned immediately. After three weekdays, the grease trap may be re-inspected. 
(4)  Mechanical grease traps. Mechanically operated grease traps may not be used by any user tied to the county collection system. 
(i)  Notice of FOG violation by DWR. 
(1)  Issue FOG NOV. As outlined in division 2 of this article, whenever the director discovers a violation of any provision of this division, a written NOV may be issued to the user. If satisfactory remedy has occurred within the timeframe specified in the NOV, the requirement for a written explanation of the violation and a plan for satisfactory correction and prevention by the user may be waived by the director. 
(2)  Disregard of FOG NOV. If a user served with a NOV fails to initiate/complete corrective action within the timeframe specified within the NOV, the director may pursue one or more of the following options: 
a.  Have the grease trap pumped and place the appropriate charge on the user's monthly water and sewer bill. 
b.  Terminate water and sewer service to the establishment. 
c.  File an appropriate action in the courts to compel compliance. 
d.  Any combination of the above enforcement actions.

ARTICLE IV. - WATER AND SEWER SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CHARGES 

Sec. 106-225. - Title, authority, and applicability. 
(a)  Title. This article shall be known and may be cited as the Gwinnett County Water and Sewer System Development Charge (SDC) Ordinance of 2010. 
(b)  Authority. The county has the authority to adopt this article pursuant to article 9, section 3, paragraph 1 and article 9, section 2, paragraph III of the Constitution of the state, and pursuant to Related Laws article II, division 8, section 23. 
(c)  Applicability. This article shall apply to all areas where the county provides water and/or sewer service, including both retail and wholesale service. 
(Code 1994, § 114-111; Ord. No. SDC-2010, 12-14-2010) 
Sec. 106-226. - Intent and purpose. 
(a)  Intent. The intent of this article is to ensure that new development bears an appropriate and proportionate share of the capital cost for system improvements necessary to provide water and/or sewer facilities in the county. It is in the interest of the public's health, safety and welfare and convenience for the county to require payment of appropriate and proportionate share charges upon commencement of any development increasing demand. This article therefore imposes a SDC on new service whenever the new service creates the potential for additional demand. Increased potential for retail water demand is generally characterized as installing or adding a water meter for any purpose other than static fire protection; increased potential for wholesale water demand is generally characterized as measured increases in wholesale water usage above past amounts. Increased potential for retail sewer demand is generally characterized as installing or adding a water meter when any portion of down-stream plumbing is connected to the sewer system; increased potential for wholesale sewer demand is generally characterized as measured increases in wholesale sewer usage above past amounts. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish revenues to assist in providing increased capacity for the water and sewer system. The increased capacity shall accommodate the additional demand new development places on the water system and/or sewer system. New development which increases demand or which has the potential to increase demand shall be required to pay a fee which does not exceed a proportionate share of the reasonably anticipated capital costs of new water and sewer facilities that its presence necessitates. This will be accomplished by requiring payment of appropriate and proportionate share charges upon commencement of any new development increasing demand, including increasing demand within wholesale jurisdictions. The water system development charge and sewer system development charge are for the exclusive purpose of providing increased capacity for the water and sanitary sewer system, respectively. 
(Code 1994, § 114-112; Ord. No. SDC-2010, 12-14-2010)

(2)  Establishment of a new sewer system connection where none previously existed mandates payment of a sewer SDC. 
(3)  A water customer who was not previously a sewer user and who taps onto sewer mandates payment of a sewer SDC(s) for all water meters serving fixtures which are thus connected to sewer. 
(4)  An existing water-only customer who adds a water tap and meter must pay an additional water SDC appropriate to the size of the new tap, regardless of whether or not there were changes in structure or occupancy. Similarly, an existing water and sewer customer who adds a water tap and meter must pay both the water and sewer SDC appropriate to the size of the new tap, regardless of whether there were changes in structure or occupancy, and regardless of whether a new sewer tap was made, unless no fixtures or plumbing of that new water tap are connected to sewer. 
(5)  A tap made for the sole purpose of irrigation shall pay a water SDC but not a sewer SDC. 
(b)  SDC payment prerequisite to a building permit. No building permit for any activity requiring payment of the appropriate SDC(s) pursuant to this article shall be issued by the county unless and until the SDC has been paid. 
(c)  Sewage pumping station charges. Any person who engages in development increasing sewer demand and who installs a new sewage pumping station shall pay sewage pumping station charges as required by this article. 
(d)  Change of use, redevelopment, or modification of structure. When a change of use, redevelopment or modification of an existing use or building requires an increase in water meter size, the new SDC(s) shall be based on the difference between the current value of the SDC for the existing tap and the SDC calculated for the proposed use. However, should the change of use, redevelopment or modification of an existing use or building or water meter result in a net decrease in water meter size, no refunds or credits for past impact fees or SDCs paid shall be made or created.

Sec. 106-229. - Payment of system development charges. 
(a)  Any person required to pay water and/or sewer SDCs pursuant to this article shall pay such fees to the department of planning and development or to the appropriate municipality prior to or concurrent with the issuance of a building permit. If an existing water meter is to be replaced with a larger meter then SDCs shall be paid prior to the installation of the new meter. Sewage pumping station charges shall be paid as a prior condition of sewer extension plan approval. 
(b)  All funds collected pursuant to this article shall be properly identified as SDCs and accounted for as further described in the section of this article on accounting for SDCs. Funds shall be used solely for the purposes specified in this article. 
(Code 1994, § 114-115; Ord. No. SDC-2010, 12-14-2010) 
Sec. 106-230. - Calculation of water system development charges and sewer system development charges. 
(a)  SDC Formulas. The maximum amount of the proportionate share SDC shall be calculated using the following formulas. In any given year the actual SDC charged may be less than the maximum allowable. Water and sewer SDCs shall be separately calculated. 
SDC = ACC × ME 
SDC = System Development Charge. 
The SDC for the meter in question. 
ACC = Allocated Capital Cost. 
The allocated capital cost of providing water facilities required to serve the demand created by an average three-fourth-inch meter customer. 
ME = Meter Equivalency. 
The meter equivalency factor for the meter in question, from the schedule of meter equivalencies established from historical usage by Gwinnett County customer categories. 
ACC = AB/CB × D 
AB = Value of the Total Asset Base for Future Customers. 
CB = Total Capacity of Total Asset Base for Future Customers. 
The capacities created by the total historical and planned investment made in facilities available for future customers expressed in gallons per day of capacity on an average daily basis. 
D = Projected Water Demand. 
The average daily water consumption of all active customers with a three-fourth-inch meter as of the calendar year(s) prior to the date the SDC resolution was passed by the WSA, which has been calculated by the Department of Water Resources (DWR) from billing records. 
AB = ((FA-G-CA-P) × %AFC) + FCIP-FRC 
FA = Total Fixed Assets. 
The total value of all existing fixed assets of the water system or sewer system. 
G = Fixed Assets Funded by Grants. 
The value of grants received by the county from the state, the EPA or other sources for system improvements. This value is deducted from the fixed assets to reflect the fact that this amount was not paid by existing customers and therefore should not be recovered from future customers through SDCs. 
CA = Contributed Assets. 
The value of water distribution lines, collection sewers, and any other water or system assets donated to the water or sewer system, usually by developers. The contributed assets received by the county are deducted from the value of existing fixed assets to reflect the fact that these facilities were not paid for by existing customers and therefore should not be recovered from future customers through the SDCs. 
P = Principal Outstanding on Bonds for Fixed Assets. 
To prevent SDCs from recovering debt on existing assets that will be repaid using future rate payments, the total amount of principal on outstanding debt used to develop existing fixed assets is deducted from the cost basis of the SDC. 
%AFC = Percent of Fixed Assets Available for Future Customers. 
Only the value of existing fixed assets that is associated with capacity actually available for use by future customers is allocated to SDCs. An estimate of the existing capacity available for future customers by functional category is multiplied by the net value of existing assets to remove the value of any assets currently used or committed to existing customers. 
FCIP = Future CIP Projects Allocated to Future Customers. 
The projected cost of capital improvement plan projects that will result in an increase in capacity available for future customers. 
FRC = Future Rate Credit. 
To prevent SDCs from recovering for the portion of the value of planned assets providing capacity that will be repaid using the present value of rate payments from future customers, a projection of rate payments by future customers for debt retirement on planned assets providing capacity is deducted from the cost basis of the SDCs. 
CB=CHI+CCIP 
CHI = Capacity of Historical Investment Available to Future Customers. 
Capacities for each system functional category of the historical investment available for future customers. 
CCIP = Capacity of CIP Projects Allocated to Future Customers. 
Capacities reflecting the net increase in capacity available for future customers resulting from all CIP projects by functional category. 
(b)  SDCs established by resolution. The amount of the SDC graduated by water meter size shall be that established by joint resolution of the water and sewerage authority and the board of commissioners. 
(Code 1994, § 114-116; Ord. No. SDC-2010, 12-14-2010) 
Sec. 106-231. - Sewage pumping station phase-out charges. 
If, for the purposes of development, a sewage pumping station must be installed, the developer shall pay sewage pumping station phase-out charges as set by joint resolution by the WSA and the BOC. Such charges may recover some or all of the costs imposed on long-range capital improvements plan caused by the public acceptance of the sewage pumping station. Such payments shall be made as a prior condition of sewer plan approval. 
(Code 1994, § 114-117; Ord. No. SDC-2010, 12-14-2010) 
Sec. 106-232. - Use of water and sewer system development charge funds. 
(a)  Dedication of SDC revenues to system improvements. Funds collected from SDCs shall be used to pay a proportionate share of system improvement costs, including servicing debt for applicable system improvements. No funds generated by SDCs shall be used for periodic or routine maintenance. 
(b)  Exclusive to either water or sewer system improvements. Water SDCs shall be used exclusively for water system improvements. Sewer SDCs shall be used exclusively for sewer system improvements. 
(c)  Annual reporting. Each fiscal period the department of financial services shall present to the BOC an annual report describing the amount of SDCs collected, encumbered and used during the preceding year. 
(d)  Debt service funding. Water and sewer SDCs may be used for the payment of principal and interest on bonds, notes or other financial obligations issued by or on behalf of the county or the WSA to finance public water or sewer system improvements, respectively. 
(Code 1994, § 114-118; Ord. No. SDC-2010, 12-14-2010) 
Sec. 106-233. - Sewage pumping station operation and maintenance and replacement charges. 
If, for the purposes of development, a sewage pumping station must be installed, the developer may be required to pay a cost as set by joint resolution of the WSA and BOC to defray the future operation and maintenance or replacement cost of that sewage pumping station. This cost may recover some or all of the projected future costs to operate, maintain, and replace the sewage pumping station over a 25-year planning period. Such payment shall be made as a prior condition of sewer plan approval. 
(Code 1994, § 114-119) 
Sec. 106-234. - Exemptions and refunds. 
(a)  Exemptions. The following shall be exempted from payment of SDCs: 
(1)  Any development whereby neither water nor sewer service is initiated. 
(2)  Any development: 
a.  Which does not add or increase the number or size of water meters; and 
b.  Where sewer service is not initiated. 
(3)  The replacement of a building, mobile home or structure that was in place on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, or the replacement of a building, mobile home or structure subsequent thereto and for which the then-correct SDC had been paid or otherwise provided for, with a new building, mobile home or structure, provided that the size of the pre-existing water meter stays the same and no new taps are requested. 
(4)  Public school districts which own the property served and which pay the water and/or sewer bill for the service requested are exempt from the payment of SDCs. 
(5)  State universities which own the property served and which pay the water and/or sewer bill for the service requested are exempt from the payment of SDCs. 
(6)  Taps made solely for the purpose of fire suppression and which are deemed to have zero consumption except for the purposes of fire protection shall not pay SDCs. However, should usage on such fire lines be initiated after installation for purposes other than fire protection then the entity receiving the water bill shall be invoiced for the full amount of the then-current water and/or sewer SDC corresponding to the size of the fire line tap, which shall thereafter be metered. Such SDC(s) shall be paid within 90 days unless usage is disconnected; unpaid SDCs shall become a lien on the property after 90 days. 
(7)  If a development eliminates or relocates one or more existing sewage pumping stations such that, even though new sewage pumping stations are built, the result is there is a decrease in the county's inventory of sewage pumping stations, then the new sewage pumping station(s) is exempt from payment of both sewage pumping station charges. 
(8)  If a development eliminates or relocates one or more existing sewage pumping stations such that, even though new sewage pumping stations are built, the result is no net increase in the county's inventory of sewage pumping stations and the new pump station(s) is in the same size category as the old pump station(s), then the new sewage pumping station(s) is exempt from payment of both sewage pumping station charges; however, if an existing pumping station is decommissioned and a larger pumping station is built, then that new pumping station is exempt from the phase-out charge but may be liable for the difference in the operation and maintenance and replacement charges applicable to different size categories of pumping stations. 
(b)  SDCs not refundable. Unless otherwise required by law, refunds of SDCs shall not be made unless such was collected in error.

200-50.2  Where uncertainty exists with respect to the location of the boundaries of any Zoning District in Gwinnett County, Georgia, the following rules shall apply. 
A.  Where a Zoning District boundary line is shown as approximately following a corporate limits line, a militia district line, a land lot line, a lot line or the centerline of a street, a county road, a state highway, an interstate highway or a railroad right-of-way or such lines extended, then such lines shall be construed to be the Zoning District boundary lines. 
B.  Where a Zoning District boundary line is shown as being set back from a street, a county road, a state highway, an interstate highway or a railroad right-of-way, and approximately parallel thereto, then such Zoning District boundary line shall be construed as being at the scaled distance from the centerline of the street, county road, state highway, interstate highway or railroad right-of-way and as being parallel thereto.

200-60.2   Relationship between Comprehensive Plan and Zoning. The Gwinnett County 2030 Unified Plan (Comprehensive Plan) does not change the existing zoning districts in Gwinnett County, does not effectuate an amendment to the Gwinnett County Zoning Maps, and does not itself permit or prohibit any existing land uses. Instead, the Unified Plan establishes broad planning policy for current and future land uses and should be consulted as a guideline for making decisions about applications to amend the Gwinnett County Zoning Maps and text of the UDO.

Requests to the Director or the Director's designee shall be in writing, accurately identify the subject property, and be accompanied by a fee established by the Board of Commissioners. 
Section 200-100. - Zoning Classification of De-Annexed Property. 
Undeveloped property which has been de-annexed from any municipality or other county will be subject to the same zoning district, including any conditions established prior to annexation. However, if the zoning district within Gwinnett County cannot be determined from existing records or by the Director, a public hearing, as specified in Section 270-20 will be conducted to establish the appropriate zoning classification for the property. Any lawfully developed, de-annexed property shall be zoned to the nearest compatible zoning district in which the use is permitted.

270-20.1   Zoning Ordinance and Official Zoning Map Amendment Procedure. 
A.  The Zoning Ordinance (as contained in Titles 1 and 2 of this UDO), including the Official Zoning Maps, may be amended from time to time by the Board of Commissioners, but no text or map amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been proposed by or shall have first been submitted to the Planning Commission for review and recommendation. 
B.  If the Planning Commission fails to submit a report within 30 days of its first meeting after it has received an amendment request complete in all respects, it shall be deemed to have given a recommendation of "no comment" on the proposed amendment. However, the Planning Commission and the applicant for an amendment may jointly agree to an extension of the thirty-day period. 
270-20.2   Public Hearing Required. 
A.  Before the Planning Commission submits a report or the Board of Commissioners enacts an amendment, they shall each hold a public hearing thereon. 
B.  At least fifteen but not more than forty-five days prior to the date of each such hearing, the Board of Commissioners shall cause to be published within a newspaper of general circulation within the territorial boundaries of Gwinnett County, a notice of the hearing. The notice shall state the time, place and purpose of the hearing. 
C.  If a proposed amendment is for the rezoning of property and involves a change in the zoning classification of 25 or fewer parcels of land, then: 
1.  The notice, in addition to the requirements above, shall include the location of the property, the present zoning classification of the property, and the proposed zoning classification of the property; 
2.  A sign containing the information outlined above shall be placed in a conspicuous location on the property not less than fifteen days prior to the date of the hearing. The sign shall be placed in accordance with the Gwinnett Public Notification Policies for Rezoning, Special Use Permit, and Variance Applications. 
270-20.3   Initiation of Amendments. Applications for amendment of the text or maps of the Zoning Ordinance may be initiated by resolution of the Board of Commissioners, or by motion of the Planning Commission, Director of Planning and Development, or by petition of any property owner addressed to the Board of Commissioners. In the case of a petition for the rezoning of property, such petition shall be submitted by the owner of record of said property, the owner's agent or by a contract purchaser with the owner's written consent. 
270-20.4   Limitation on Permits. Once a map amendment is initiated by the Board of Commissioners, no application for a clearing, grubbing, grading, septic tank, building, development or other similar permit, or for a Variance or Special Use Permit for the affected property shall be accepted for processing or acted upon until final action is taken by the Board of Commissioners on the proposed map amendment. Provided, however, that if the Board of Commissioners does not take final action on the proposed map amendment within six (6) months from the date of initiation, Permit, Variance and Special Use Permit applications shall again be accepted and reviewed pursuant to existing zoning. And, further provided that such permit applications shall be accepted during the map amendment process if the proposed use is authorized under the same conditions in both the existing and proposed zoning district. 
270-20.5   Standards Governing Exercise of the Zoning Power. The Board of Commissioners finds that the following standards are relevant in balancing the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare against the right to the unrestricted use of property and shall govern the exercise of the zoning power: 
A.  Whether a proposed rezoning will permit a use that is suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property; 
B.  Whether a proposed rezoning will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property; 
C.  Whether the property to be affected by a proposed rezoning has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned; 
D.  Whether the proposed rezoning will result in a use which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, or schools; 
E.  Whether the proposed rezoning is in conformity with the policy and intent of the Unified Plan and Future Development Map; and 
F.  Whether there are other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the proposed rezoning. 
270-20.6   Impact Analysis. If a proposed amendment is for the rezoning of property and involves a change in the zoning classification of 25 or fewer parcels of land, then: 
A.  The initiating party, if a party other than the Board of Commissioners, shall be required to file, with its application for amendment, a written, documented analysis of the impact of the proposed zoning with respect to each of the matters enumerated in Section 270-20.5, above. Such a zoning proposal and analysis shall be a public record. 
B.  The Department shall, with respect to each such zoning proposal, investigate and make a recommendation with respect to each of the matters enumerated in Section 270-20.5 above. 
C.  The Department shall make a written record of its investigation and recommendations, and this record shall be a public record. 
D.  The Planning Commission shall, with respect to each such zoning proposal, investigate and make a recommendation with respect to each of the matters enumerated in Section 270-20.5 above. The Planning Commission shall make a written record of its investigation and recommendations, and this record shall be a public record.

A.  Approve the proposed amendment as presented; 
B.  Approve the proposed amendment with conditions; 
C.  Approve a similar or less intense use (including special uses), with or without conditions, if the proposed amendment is for the rezoning of property; 
D.  Deny the proposed amendment in whole or in part; 
E.  Refer the matter back to the Planning Commission for reconsideration; 
F.  Table final action to a future regularly scheduled business session or public hearing, or table the final action indefinitely. 
270-20.8   Plans and Other Documents Showing Proposed Use and Impact Required. An application for an amendment to create or extend a Zoning District shall be accompanied by a sketch plan at scale and such other plans, elevations or additional information as the Director and this Ordinance may require, showing the proposed development and its impact on natural and built systems. Additional information may include without limitation traffic studies, utility studies, and drainage studies. 
270-20.9   Change in Conditions of Zoning. Changes to the conditions of an approved Rezoning shall be subject to the same application, review and approval process as a new application, including the payment of relevant fees. 
270-20.10   Actions to be Taken if Plans are not Implemented within Specified Time Limits. 
A.  For any zoning map amendment for which the Board of Commissioners is not the applicant, and upon which property no development permit, building permit, or certificate of occupancy has been issued within 12 months of the date of approval of said amendment, the Board of Commissioners may review the zoning district classification of the property and determine whether it shall be continued or initiated for rezoning. 
B.  Such properties shall first be reviewed by the Planning Commission, which shall make such findings and recommendations as it deems appropriate. 
Section 270-30. - Special Use Permits. 
270-30.1   Purpose. The purpose of a Special Use Permit is to provide a process for review of a use that is generally compatible with the use characteristics of a zoning district, but requires individual review of its location, design, height, intensity, configuration and public facility impact to determine the appropriateness of the use for any particular site and its compatibility with adjacent uses. 
270-30.2   Authority. The Board of Commissioners shall take final action on applications for Special Use Permits in accordance with the procedures, standards and limitations of the UDO. In order to accommodate these special uses, the Special Use Permit allows the Board of Commissioners to approve a special use on a particular parcel without changing the general zoning district. Such approval shall be subject to the requirements set forth in this UDO and any additional conditions deemed necessary to ensure the compatibility of the special use with the surrounding properties. All Special Use Permit applications shall be for firm development proposals only. The Special Use Permit shall not be used for securing early zoning for conceptual proposals which may not be undertaken for some time. 
270-30.3   Special Use Permit Procedure. The application and review process for a Special Use Permit shall be the same as those contained in Section 270-20, herein. In addition to the information and/or site plans which are required to be submitted for the proposed development, additional information deemed necessary by the Director in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding area shall be submitted. 
270-30.4   Staff Analysis and Recommendation. The Staff analysis and recommendation on each application for a Special Use Permit shall follow the same procedures as those contained in Section 270-20, herein. In the review process, particular emphasis shall be given to the evaluation of the characteristics of the proposed use in relationship to neighboring properties and the compatibility of the proposed use with its surroundings. 
270-30.5   Public Hearing Required. The public hearing process, impact analysis and application of the Standards Governing the Exercise of Zoning Power for a Special Use Permit shall be the same as those contained in Section 270-20, herein. 
270-30.6   Action by the Board of Commissioners. When considering a Special Use Permit application, the Board of Commissioners shall consider the policies and objectives of the Unified Plan and Future Development Map, particularly in relationship to the proposed site and surrounding area, and shall consider the potential adverse impacts on the surrounding area, especially in regards to but not limited to traffic, storm drainage, land values and compatibility of land use activities. Following its public hearing the Board of Commissioners may: 
A.  Approve the proposed special use as presented; 
B  Approve the proposed special use with conditions; 
C.  Deny the proposed special use in whole or in part; 
D.  Refer the matter back to the Planning Commission for reconsideration; 
E.  Table final action to a future regularly scheduled business session or public hearing, or table the final action indefinitely. 
270-30.7   Special Uses Within or Accessory to a Dwelling. An application for a Special Use Permit in a residential zoning district where the use is proposed to operate in a dwelling or as an accessory use to a dwelling is subject to the following additional requirements: 
A.  The Special Use Permit shall be valid for no more than an initial two-year period. Upon or before the expiration of the Special Use Permit, the owner shall make application to renew the Special Use Permit if continuance is desired. As part of a Special Use Permit renewal, the Board of Commissioners may waive any subsequent time limitation. 
B.  The special use shall operate within the dwelling on the property or, if approved by the Board of Commissioners, in an accessory structure. 
C.  The exterior character of the dwelling shall be preserved in its residential state and there shall be no outside evidence of the operation of the special use to the neighborhood, except for any accessory structure approved by the Board of Commissioners. 
D.  The owner of the property or business shall occupy the property and shall operate any business associated with the special use. 
E.  The owner of the property shall submit with the application a signed statement in which he/she agrees that the Special Use Permit, if approved, shall automatically terminate in the event that the property is sold, transferred, or otherwise conveyed to any other party; or the business which operates the special use is sold, transferred, otherwise conveyed or discontinued. The owner shall also agree to notify the Director in writing upon the occurrence of any of these events. 
F.  In addition to the information and/or site plans required, the owner of the property shall submit with the application for a Special Use Permit information regarding the ownership of any business associated with the use, the experience and background qualifications related to the operation of said business, prior similar businesses operated, applicable State of Georgia certifications, licenses and like information. 
270-30.8   Voluntary Termination of a Special Use Permit. The owner of the property approved for a Special Use Permit may voluntarily request termination of the Special Use Permit by notifying the Director in writing. The Director shall notify the Board of Commissioners through the Planning Commission of voluntary terminations as they occur and shall change the official zoning maps to reflect any voluntary terminations. The approval of a Special Use Permit for a specific use which may be operated by a lessee under a private agreement with a lessor in any zoning district shall not obligate the Board of Commissioners to be responsible for or be required to resolve any disputes which may arise out of the voluntary termination of the Special Use Permit by the property owner. 
270-30.9   Change in Conditions or Modification of a Special Use Permit. Changes to the conditions or modification of an approved Special Use Permit shall be subject to the same application, review and approval process as a new application, including the payment of relevant fees. 
270-30.10   Development of an Approved Special Use. 
A.  The issuance of a Special Use Permit shall only constitute approval of the proposed use, and development of the use shall not be carried out until the applicant has secured all other permits and approvals required. The Department shall not issue a Certificate of Occupancy for the specific use unless all requirements and conditions of the Special Use Permit have been fulfilled by the owner of the property. 
B.  If an application is approved and a Special Use Permit is granted, all conditions which may have been attached to the approval are binding on the property. All subsequent development and use of the property shall be in accordance with the approved plan and conditions. Once established, the special use shall be in continuous operation. Upon discovery that the operation of the special use has or had ceased for a period of 90 days or more and the owner of the property has not requested voluntary termination of the Special Use Permit, the Director may forward a report to the Board of Commissioners through the Planning Commission which may recommend that action be taken to remove the Special Use Permit from the property. 
270-30.11   Compliance with Special Use Permit Requirements. The Planning and Development Department shall have the right to periodically examine the operation of the specific use to determine compliance with the requirements and any conditions. If the Director determines that the requirements and conditions are being violated, a written notice shall be issued to the owner of the property outlining the nature of the violation and giving the owner of the property a maximum of 10 days to come into compliance. If after 10 days the violations continue to exist, the Director shall forward a report to the Board of Commissioners through the Planning Commission which may recommend that action be taken to remove the Special Use Permit from the property. 
270-30.12   Actions to be Taken if Plans of Property Owner are not Implemented within Specified Time Limits. The special use for which a Special Use Permit is granted shall commence operations or construction within 12 months of the date of approval by the Board of Commissioners. If, at the end of this 12-month period, the Director determines that active efforts are not proceeding toward operation or construction, a report may be forwarded to the Board of Commissioners through the Planning Commission which may recommend that action be taken to remove the Special Use Permit from the property. 
270-30.13   Appeal of a Special Use Permit Decision. Any person, persons or entities jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Commissioners regarding a Special Use Permit application may take an appeal to the Superior Court of the County. The appeal shall be limited to the proceedings and record of the Board of Commissioners. Any appeal must be filed within 30 days of the decision of the Board of Commissioners, and upon failure of such appeal, the decision of the Board of Commissioners shall be final. 
Section 270-40. - Conditional Approvals. 
270-40.1  In adopting an amendment to the Official Zoning Map, or approving a Special Use Permit, the Board of Commissioners may impose special conditions which it deems necessary in order to make the requested action acceptable and consistent with the purposes of the district(s) involved and to further the goals and objectives of the 2030 Unified Plan.

Section 270-50. - Exceptions from the Definition of the Term "Family". 
The Board of Commissioners shall have the power to hear and decide requests for exceptions from the definition of the term "Family" by Special Use Permit when such requests are submitted by groups of more than three persons who are not all related by blood or marriage. Such exceptions may be granted in cases of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the Board of Commissioners that: 
270-50.1  There are extraordinary or exceptional conditions pertaining to the group in question, and relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good nor impair the purposes or intent of this UDO; 
270-50.2  The group consists of between four and eight persons who live together as a single housekeeping unit and who would otherwise find it economically prohibitive to live in a group of three or fewer persons in a single family residential district; 
270-50.3  The residential dwelling which forms the subject of the variance request contains at least eighty square feet of bedroom space per occupant;

270-60.1  Once an application for an amendment to the Official Zoning Map or an application for a Variance or Special Use Permit has been made, the applicant may withdraw such application without prejudice only until such time as the official withdrawal deadline published in the Public Hearing Schedule, maintained by the Department. 
270-60.2  An application may not be withdrawn by an applicant or property owner under any circumstance after the official withdrawal deadline. Once past the published withdrawal deadline, all applications shall be considered by the Board of Commissioners or Zoning Board of Appeals, as appropriate, and shall receive final action, unless having been administratively withdrawn for cause by the Department. 
Section 270-70. - Lapse of Time Requirement for Reapplication. 
The following shall apply to the reapplication for a Zoning Map Amendment, Variance or Special Use Permit. 
270-70.1  No application or reapplication for any zoning map amendment affecting the same land or any portion thereof shall be acted upon within 12 months from the date of last action by the Board of Commissioners unless such 12-month period is waived by the Board of Commissioners, and in no case may such an application or reapplication be reconsidered in less than six months from the date of last action by the Board of Commissioners. 
No application or reapplication for the same type of Variance or Special Use Permit affecting the same land or any portion thereof shall be acted upon within 12 months from the date of last action by the Board of Commissioners or Zoning Board of Appeals, as appropriate, unless such 12 month period is waived by the Board of Commissioners or Zoning Board of Appeals as appropriate, and in no case may such an application or reapplication be reconsidered in less than six months from the date of last action by the Board of Commissioners or Zoning Board of Appeals, as appropriate. 
270-70.2  Administrative variances, as outlined in Section 270-130, shall not be subject to this time lapse requirement.

A.  The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the following powers: 
1.  To hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the Department of Planning and Development Director in the enforcement of this UDO. 
2.  To authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, such variances from the terms of Title 2 and applicable sections of Title 3 of the UDO as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of Title 2 and applicable Sections of Title 3 of the UDO will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of Title 2 of the UDO shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. Such variances may be granted in such individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the Zoning Board of Appeals that: 
a.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular property in question because of its size, shape, or topography; 
b.  The application of Title 2 of the UDO to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; 
c.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; 
d.  Such conditions are not the result of any actions of the property owner; 
e.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good nor impair the purposes or intent of Title 2 of the UDO. 
3.  No variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by Title 2 of the UDO or which would result in a greater intensity of development on a property than would otherwise be allowed if no variance were involved. 
B.  In exercising the above powers, the Zoning Board of Appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of Title 2 of the UDO, reverse decisions or determinations from which the appeal is taken and, to that end, shall have all the powers of the Director from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or revoke or direct the issuance or revocation of a Building or other permit.

270-100.2  The purpose of a variance is to provide a mechanism when, owing to special conditions, the strict application of Title 2 would impose on a landowner exceptional and undue hardship that can be mitigated without conferring on the applicant special privilege. 
270-100.3   Initiation. A written petition for a variance is to be initiated by the owner(s) of the subject property or the authorized agent(s) of the owner(s) of the property for which relief is sought.

270-100.7   Standards for Granting Variances. 
A.  Granting Variances. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not grant a variance unless evidence is presented supporting conclusions that the variance meets each of the following criteria: 
1.  Arises from a condition that is unique and peculiar to the land, structures and buildings involved. 
2.  Is necessary because the particular physical surroundings, the size, shape or topographical condition of the specific property involved would result in unnecessary hardship for the owner, lessee or occupants; as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the provisions of Title 2 of the UDO are literally enforced. 
3.  The condition requiring the requested relief is not ordinarily found in properties of the same zoning district as the subject property. 
4.  The condition is created by the regulations of Title 2 of the UDO and not by an action or actions of the property owner or the applicant. 
5.  The granting of the variance will not impair or injure other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the subject property is located, nor impair an adequate supply of light or air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire, create a hazard to air navigation, endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood. 
6.  The variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structures. 
7.  The variance desired will not be opposed to the general spirit and intent of Title 2 of the UDO or the purpose and intent of the Gwinnett County 2030 Unified Plan. 
B.  No variance shall be authorized to: 
1.  Allow a structure or use not authorized in the applicable zoning district or a density of development that is not authorized within such district. 
2.  Allow any variance that conflicts with or changes any requirement enacted as a condition of zoning or of a Special Use Permit by the Board of Commissioners. 
3.  Reduce, waive or modify in any manner the minimum lot area established by the Board of Commissioners through a special condition of approval. 
4.  Permit the expansion or enlargement of any non-conforming use of land, non-conforming use of land and buildings in combination, non-conforming use of land and structures in combination, or non-conforming use requiring a Special Use Permit. 
5.  Permit the re-establishment of any non-conforming use of land, non-conforming use of land and buildings in combination, non-conforming use of land and structures in combination, or non-conforming use requiring a Special Use Permit where such use has lapsed. 
6.  The Zoning Board of Appeals may attach reasonable conditions to a variance when necessary to prevent or minimize adverse impacts upon property or the environment. 
Section 270-110. - Burden of Proof in Appeals and Variances. 
270-110.1   Requirements. It shall be the responsibility of an applicant seeking relief to present facts and evidence to explain how the proposed appeal or variance is consistent with the general spirit and intent of Title 2 of the UDO. 
270-110.2   Review. It is the duty of the Zoning Board of Appeals to review such facts and evidence in light of the intent of Title 2 of the UDO to balance the public health, safety and general welfare against the injury to a specific applicant that would result from the strict application of the provisions of the UDO on the applicant's property.

Chapter 400. - Soil Erosion, Sedimentation, and Pollution Control 

Section 400-10. - Title and Purpose. 
The real potential exists for excessive quantities of soil to erode from areas that are undergoing land disturbance. The resulting sediment could clog storm sewers and road ditches, add mud to streams and silt lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. Excessive sediment limits the use of water for most beneficial purposes. Sediment choked streams are unsightly and their reduced channel capacity can result in flooding and associated damages, including the threat to the public health and safety. Therefore, it is the purpose of this chapter is to effectively contain soil erosion and sedimentation on the parcels where land is being disturbed by requiring provisions for water disposal and the protection of soil surfaces prior to, during, and after the land disturbance in order to promote the safety, public health, convenience, and general welfare of the citizens of Gwinnett County. 
Section 400-20. - Exemptions. 
This Chapter shall apply to any land-disturbing activity undertaken by any person on any land except for the following: 
400-20.1  Surface mining, as the same is defined in O.C.G.A. § 12-4-72, The Georgia Surface Mining Act of 1968. 
400-20.2  Granite quarrying and land clearing for such quarrying. 
400-20.3  Such minor land-disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion. 
400-20.4  The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than 1 acre and is not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than 1 acre and not otherwise exempted under this paragraph; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements set forth in Sections 400-30.1, 400-30.2, and 400-30.3 of this UDO, O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6, and this paragraph. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this paragraph, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20. In any such buffer zone, no land disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the Director of the Environmental Protection Division may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The general provision and minimum requirements of 400-30.1 and the minimum requirements of Sections 400-30.2 and 400-30.3 of this UDO, O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b) and the buffer zones provided by this section shall be enforced by the Department.

Section 400-30. - Requirements for Erosion and Sedimentation Control Using Best Management Practices. 
400-30.1   General Provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities that are not exempted by this Chapter shall contain provisions for the application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. These provisions shall be incorporated into the Erosion, Sedimentation, and Pollution Control Plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the requirements of Sections 400-30.2 and 400-30.3. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed and continually maintained to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with the requirements of this UDO and the NPDES general permit. 
400-30.2   Minimum Requirements/Best Management Practices (BMP's). 
A.  Best Management Practices as set forth in Sections 400-30.2 and 400-30.3 shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of Best Management Practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the Director of the Environmental Protection Division or to any other allegation of noncompliance with Subsection B of this Section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act . As used in this section, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
B.  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where Best Management Practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbance permit issued by Gwinnett County or of any state general permit issued by the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act , for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU's) for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units (NTU's) for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines issued by the Director of the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than 5 acres. 
C.  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain Best Management Practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbance permit issued by Gwinnett County or of any state general permit issued by the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such failure occurs. 
D.  The Director of the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Georgia Board of Natural Resources, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
400-30.3   Additional Minimum Requirements. The rules and regulations, ordinances or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and Best Management Practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation which are consistent with, and no less stringent than the state general permit, and those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, shall be observed by all land disturbers and plan preparers, as well as the following: 
A.  Stripping of vegetation, regrading, and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion. 
B.  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;. 
C.  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential. 
D.  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected, and supplemented. 
E.  The disturbed areas and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum. 
F.  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable. 
G.  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development. The disturbed area shall be stabilized with temporary vegetation or mulch if land-disturbing activity temporarily ceases for more than 14 calendar days. 
H.  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable. The disturbed area shall be stabilized with permanent vegetation if land-disturbing activity ceases for more than 30 calendar days. 
I.  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of this Chapter and O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. 
J.  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills. 
K.  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property. 
L.  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners. 
M.  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings shall be kept to a minimum; 
N.  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in Section 400-30.2b. 
O.  Except as provided in Subsection P of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the Director of the Environmental Protection Division determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the Director of the Environmental Protection Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this paragraph, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year-round; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the Director of the Environmental Protection Division as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
1.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and it shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. 
2.  Once the final stabilization of the construction site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed. 
3.  Exception: Any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed. 
4.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
a.  Stream crossings for water lines; or, 
b.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and, 
c.  Prior to action by the Director of the Environmental Protection Division, buffer variance requests along state waters with drainage areas greater than 20 acres shall be reviewed for approval or denial by the director using the same buffer variance criteria as adopted by the Board of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. 
P.  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the Board of Natural Resources providing for notice to the Environmental Protection Division or the County of the location and extent of the piping and prescribed methodology for minimizing the impact of such piping and for measuring the volume of water discharged by the stream. Any such pipe must stop short of the downstream landowner's property, and the landowner must comply with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The Director of the Environmental Protection Division may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
1.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and it shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. 
2.  Once the final stabilization of the construction site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed. 
3.  Exception: Any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and, 
4.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
a.  Stream crossings for water lines; or, 
b.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
Section 400-40. - Proof or Presumption of Violation by Injury. 
The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a land disturbance permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of, nor create a presumption of, a violation of the standards provided for in this UDO or the terms of a land disturbance permit. 
Section 400-50. - Permit Application and Plan Requirements. 
400-50.1   General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of Gwinnett County that affect the tract to be disturbed and the area surrounding it.

D.  For any property for which a Tree Preservation and/or Replacement Plan was not required prior to issuance of a land disturbance permit under the provisions of Subsection 630-20.2, all areas required to be undisturbed shall be provided with protective tree fencing along the limits of clearing or grading which adjoin existing trees in accordance with the provisions found in Subsection 630-50.2. These measures shall be in place prior to beginning clearing or grading activities and shall be maintained throughout the land-disturbing period. 
Section 630-30.   Tree Density Requirements.
630-30.1   Tree Density Standard. 
A.  On each property for which a Tree Preservation and/or Replacement Plan is required, existing trees shall be retained and new trees shall be planted such that the property shall attain or exceed a Tree Density Standard of 16 Tree Density Units per acre, or 20 Tree Density Units per acre as specified in the Overlay Districts, or 24 Tree Density Units per acre for limited land-disturbing activities (Sections 630-10.4, 5, 6 and 7). 
B.  Trees, both existing and new, shall be reasonably distributed throughout the site, with emphasis on tree groupings to achieve aesthetic results following professional landscaping standards. Trees, including street trees, may be retained or planted for credit within a public street right-of-way. 
C.  Trees located in a stream buffer may be counted toward fulfilling the Tree Density Standard provided the acreage within the stream buffer is included in the calculations used to fulfill the Tree Density Standard. 
D.  Trees, both existing and new, located in a temporary construction buffer may be counted toward fulfilling the Tree Density Standard provided the acreage within the temporary construction buffer is included in the calculations used to fulfill the Tree Density Standard. 
E.  If a specimen tree's Critical Root Zone (CRZ) falls outside of the buffer partial credit may be obtained toward fulfilling the Tree Density Standard. See Section 630-30.5 in this UDO. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2015-00001(GCID No. 2015-0360), 4-28-15) 
630-30.2   Buffer Exclusion in Fulfilling the Tree Density Standard. 
A.  Existing trees proposed to be retained and preserved, and new trees proposed to be planted, in order to meet the buffer requirements as required per Table 610.1, as required by the Supplemental Use Standards, or as a condition of Zoning, Special Use, Variance, or Waiver approval shall not be considered in fulfilling the requirements of Tree Density Standard for the project. 
B.  The acreage within the buffer shall be excluded from the overall acreage used to calculate the Tree Density Standard. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2015-00001(GCID No. 2015-0360), 4-28-15) 
630-30.3   Easement Exclusion. Properties possessing natural gas, petroleum or electric power transmission easements, or major sanitary sewer main (greater than 8 inches in diameter) or water main (greater than 16 inches in diameter) distribution easements, may exclude the land area contained in the easement from the total acreage of the property in fulfilling the Tree Density Standard provided that no improvements (e.g. parking lots, tennis courts, driveways, greenways, storm water detention facilities, etc.) are proposed within the easement. If any improvements are proposed within the easement, then the land area so used within the easement for the improvements, plus an additional 10-feet of land area surrounding the improvements, shall be included in the total acreage of the property to fulfill the Tree Density Standard. 
630-30.4   Lake and Pond Exclusion. Properties with a lake or pond greater than 1 acre in size may exclude the land area contained in the lake or pond from the total acreage of the property in fulfilling the Tree Density Standard. 
630-30.5   Tree Density Standard Calculation. The Tree Density Standard shall be calculated by summing the following credits and dividing by the total acreage of the project included within the limits of the permit application (but excluding any acreage included within a zoning buffer and other land area allowed to be excluded by this Chapter). 
A.  Existing trees. 
1.  Credit for existing trees proposed to be preserved on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the diameter of the tree times the units assigned in Table 630.2. Credit for Existing Trees. Credit shall be given for all trees preserved on a property having a diameter of 3 inches or more, except trees located in a required zoning buffer. Tree sample areas of similar vegetation of 50 square feet or larger may be used as a method of measuring Tree Density Units. 
B.  New trees. 
1.  Credit for new trees proposed to be replaced on the site shall be calculated based on the units assigned in Table 630.4, Credit for Replacement Trees. Credit shall be given for all new trees replaced on a property except for trees 1 inch or less in caliper and new trees planted in a required zoning buffer. Deciduous trees shall be a minimum 2 inches in caliper and evergreen trees shall be a minimum of 6 feet in height. New multi-trunked trees shall only be given credit by measuring the single largest trunk and not the cumulative total of the various trunks. Tree-form shrubs shall not be given credit for satisfying the required Tree Density Standard. 
C.  Specimen trees. 
1.  Credit for specimen trees preserved on the site shall be calculated based on the units assigned in Table 630.3, Credit for Specimen Trees. When multi-trunked specimen trees split below diameter at breast height the trunk shall be measured at the narrowest point below the split. 
2.  The Critical Root Zone (CRZ) shall include no less than the minimum area beneath a tree that must be left undisturbed. The CRZ is a concentric circle centering on the specimen tree's trunk with a radius equal in feet to 1.5 times the number of inches of the trunk's diameter at breast height (4.5 feet) or the dripline, whichever is greater. For example the CRZ for a 24 inch diameter tree trunk is a 36 foot radius concentric circle from the trunk of the tree. However, if the dripline extends further than the 36 foot circle that dripline shall take precedence. 
3.  Credit shall be given for all specimen trees preserved on a property except for those located in a required zoning buffer where partial credit may be given. A specimen tree located within a buffer with a CRZ extending beyond the buffer is allowed partial credit toward Tree Density Units. The partial credit is based on the percentage of CRZ that is outside of the buffer. For example: a 30 inch specimen tree's CRZ extends by 20 percent over the buffer line then the developer receives 20 percent of the credit for a 30 inch existing specimen tree (19.6 × .20 = 3.92 TDU's). 
4.  To determine the percentage of CRZ outside of the buffer, measure the area of the CRZ circle. Then measure the area of CRZ outside of the buffer. Divide the smaller number into the larger number and that is the percentage of CRZ. For example: a specimen tree's CRZ is 6,000 square feet, 1,200 square feet is outside of the buffer. Divide 1,200 by 6,000 and the answer is .2 or 20 percent of the CRZ is outside of the buffer. 
D.  Additional credits shall be granted under the following ;ol1; 
circumstances: 
1.  Existing trees to be preserved within a 100-year flood plain shall be granted a bonus credit of 50 percent of the units assigned in Table 630.2 unless the tree is located within a required zoning buffer. 
E.  Genus percentage for overall site. 
1.  There shall be no more than 33 percent of any one genus of tree for overall site. Provide calculations on the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. 
630-30.9   Trees Selected for Planting. 
A.  Replacement trees proposed to be planted for credit toward meeting the minimum required Tree Density Standard on a property shall comply with the following: 
1.  The spacing of replacement trees must be compatible with spatial site limitations and with responsible consideration towards species size when mature. 
2.  Trees selected for planting shall be a species listed in the Tree Species List in Section 4 of the UDO Appendix. Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established by the International Society of Arboriculture, as included in the "Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual," latest edition. Refer to the American Association of Nurserymen publication "American Standard for Nursery Stock" (ANSI Z60, 1973) for plant material quality specifications. Refer to the "Manual of Woody Landscape Plants" (Michael Dirr, 1983, Castle Books) for information on tree species site requirements. 
3.  Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects, and must be of good vigor, so as to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability. 
Table 630.2. Credit for Existing Trees (measured at 4.5 feet above the ground). 

 
* Tree diameter for existing trees is measured at 4.5 feet above the ground. Tree diameter fractions may be "rounded up" if 0.5 inches or greater or "rounded down" if less than 0.5 inches. 
Table 630.3. Credit for Specimen Trees (measured at 4.5 feet above the ground). 

 
*Tree diameter for existing trees is measured at 4.5 feet above the ground. 
** Multi-trunked specimen trees shall be measured at the narrowest point below the split. 
Table 630.4. Credit for Replacement Trees (measured at 6 inches above the ground). 

 
*Tree caliper for new replacement trees is measured at 6 inches above the ground. Tree caliper fractions may be "rounded up" if 0.5 inches or greater or "rounded down" if less than 0.5 inches. New planted multi-trunked trees shall be given credit by measuring the single largest trunk only. Tree-form shrubs shall not be given credit. 
Section 630-40.   Tree Canopy Calculation Requirement.
630-40.1  The tree canopy calculation requirement is required for all new developments and existing developments adding structural or site improvements. 
630-40.2  b>Tree Canopy Calculation. 
A.  The tree canopy shall be calculated by assigning square feet of canopy to each tree proposed and each tree preserved. Square feet of canopy can be found in the Tree Species List in Section 4 of the UDO Appendix. Stands of three or more existing trees can be computed with polygons and given in terms of square feet. Both existing and newly planted trees located in buffers shall be counted. Include buffer trees, landscape strip trees, parking lot trees and any tree preserved or replaced within the site in the tree canopy calculation. 
B.  Add the total square feet of canopy. Take the total site acreage and convert that to square feet. Divide the total square feet of canopy into the total square feet for the site and list it as a percentage. Provide these calculations on the Tree Preservation and/or Replacement plan. There is no minimum or maximum tree canopy percentage required at this time. 
Example of Tree Canopy Calculation. 

 
Section 630-50.   Tree Preservation and Replacement Requirements.
The following guidelines and standards shall apply to trees proposed to be preserved for credit toward meeting the minimum required Tree Density Standard on a property and to all boundary trees extending into permitting property. 
630-50.1   Tree Protection Areas. 
A.  The root system is generally within the dripline or Critical Root Zone. To protect these critical roots, a Tree Protection Area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained. 
B.  The Tree Protection Area shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree canopy as defined by the dripline or Critical Root Zone of the tree or group of trees collectively. 
C.  Site Utility and Grading Plans shall clearly indicate that the Tree Protection Areas will not be disturbed. 
D.  Construction site activities such as parking, materials storage, concrete washout, burnhole placement, etc., shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within Tree Protection Areas. 
630-50.2   Protective Barriers. 
A.  Protective tree fencing shall be installed between buffers, Tree Protection Areas and areas proposed to be cleared, graded, or otherwise disturbed on the site, prior to any land disturbance. 
B.  All Tree Protection Areas shall be designated as such with "tree save area signs" posted in addition to the required protective fencing. Signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with tree protection standards are recommended for site entrances. 
C.  All Tree Protection Areas must be protected from soil sedimentation intrusion through the use of silt screens or other acceptable measures placed up-slope from the tree protection area. 
D.  All protective tree fencing and all erosion control barriers must be installed prior to and maintained throughout the land-disturbing and construction process, and should not be removed until final landscaping is installed. 
630-50.3   Encroachment. If encroachment into a Tree Protection Area occurs causing irreparable damage to the trees, the Tree Preservation and/or Replacement Plan shall be revised to compensate for the loss. Under no circumstances shall the developer be relieved of responsibility for compliance with the provisions of this Chapter of the UDO, nor shall plan revision activities stop the Department from instituting action for violation of this Chapter of the UDO. 
Section 630-60.   Tree Species List Requirements.
Tree species lists are found in Section 4 of the UDO Appendix. The Director is authorized to administratively add and delete species to all lists. Except as specifically approved by the Director as a modification, only the trees listed shall be given credit towards meeting the requirements of this Chapter. 
Section 630-70.   Specimen Trees.
630-70.1  Specimen trees are required to be preserved. A preliminary site visit shall take place on site between the certified arborist, authorized registered professional or registered forester contracted by the developer and the Department of Planning and Development staff certified arborist and a determination shall be made at that time which trees are identified as specimen trees. A site visit prior to approval of the Specimen Tree Concept Plan will allow for incorporation of specimen trees into the overall site design. For preliminary site visit criteria refer to Section 630-70.4 of this UDO. For plan preparation guidelines for the Specimen Tree Survey and Specimen Tree Concept Plan refer to Section 320-20 of this UDO. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2015-00001(GCID No. 2015-0360), 4-28-15) 
630-70.2  A Specimen Tree Survey Plan is required to be submitted to the Department for all development that does not meet the exemptions listed in Section 630-70.8 below prior to the Specimen Tree Concept Plan submittal and shall be prepared by a certified arborist, authorized registered professional or registered forester. In cases where there is phasing of development a Specimen Tree Survey Plan and a Specimen Tree Concept Plan is required for the entire property boundaries prior to the Final Plat for the first phase. Any tree that meets the identification criteria for tree size in Section 630-70.3 below is considered a specimen tree and shall be shown on the Specimen Tree Survey Plan. Any tree that meets the identification criteria for tree size and condition in Section 630-70.3 shall be shown on the Specimen Tree Concept Plan. In general, the Specimen Tree Survey Plan shows where the existing specimen trees that meet the identification criteria for size are located and the Specimen Tree Concept Plan shows where the existing specimen trees that meet the identification criteria for size and condition are located in relation to the conceptual site design.

5.  Any proposed disturbance to the specimen tree's CRZ from 25.1 to 30 percent may receive credit based upon what type of disturbance is proposed. Any proposed disturbance and specialty cut slopes shall be reviewed by the Director. 
a.  For example: Given a 36 inch specimen tree whose critical root zone is proposed to be disturbed by 15.4 percent: Table 630.3 assigns a 36 inch specimen tree 28.4 tree density units (TDU's). That tree may receive credit for 50 percent of 28.4 TDU's which is equivalent to 14.2 TDU's. 
B.  When critical root zone disturbance exceeds 30 percent the Director is hereby authorized to determine recompense. 
C.  In the event a specimen tree's Critical Root Zone has experienced unauthorized impact and the disturbance is documented by photos, the Director is hereby authorized to determine recompense. 
630-70.10   Recompense/Specimen Tree Removal with Director Approval. 
A.  Director Approval is required for removal of specimen trees. The Director is hereby authorized to make a determination whether a specimen tree may be removed. 
1.  If a specimen tree previously identified on the Specimen Tree Concept Plan to be preserved cannot be preserved due to site constraints, the developer shall submit to the Director a statement of hardship alleging a necessity for removal of the specimen tree and site design alternatives. Examples of hardship include, but are not limited to, a tree's proximity to overhead transmission lines and topography after site design options have been exhausted. Hardship factors require due justification and shall include documentation. 
a.  Plans to be submitted to the Director showing hardship justification shall include the following: 
i.  Specimen Tree Survey Plan. 
ii.  Existing and proposed contours. 
iii.  Specimen Tree Concept Plan. 
B.  The Director is hereby authorized to determine recompense requirements when a specimen tree requires removal based on site constraints. Recompense requirements shall not count toward existing specimen Tree Density Units. 
C.  If specimen tree removal is approved by the Director, recompense Tree Density Units generated from removal of a specimen tree(s) shall not be counted toward any landscape requirement such as parking lot, landscape strip, or buffer trees. 
D.  If specimen tree removal is approved by the Director, and if the existing Tree Density Units remaining post construction exceed the required Tree Density Units per acre requirement, recompense Tree Density Units may count toward any additional existing Tree Density Units. 
E.  The Director is hereby authorized to make a final determination whether a tree is a specimen tree or whether it has historical significance. 
F.  Trees shown on plan and planted on site for recompense shall be a minimum of 2 inches in caliper or greater, or a minimum of 6 feet in height or greater at time of planting and may be hardwood or softwood or a combination thereof. 
G.  Trees planted for recompense shall be included in the overall percentage of genus calculations for the site. Refer to Subsection 630-30.5.E. 
630-70.11   Recompense/Specimen Tree Removal without Director Approval. 
A.  If a specimen tree is removed without prior approval from the Director, the penalty to replace that tree is two times the Tree Density Units of the specimen tree removed. Replacement tree(s) shall be 3 inches caliper or greater. 
B.  If a specimen tree is removed without Director Approval with no residual evidence of its condition with the exception of the trunk, the diameter of the trunk will determine if the tree was of specimen quality. Required recompense units shall be two times the Tree Density Units of the specimen tree removed. Replacement trees shall be 3 inches caliper or greater. 
C.  If there is evidence that a specimen tree is removed without plan approval and there is no residual evidence of its condition or trunk diameter, recompense requirements shall be a minimum of two 28-inch hardwood trees. The property owner will be required to plant 34.4 Tree Density Units on site in addition to other site density and landscape requirements. 
630-70.12   Specimen Tree Options. The following are suggested guidelines for successful specimen tree preservation. 
A.  Specimen Tree Value. At the option of developer and contractor a value of the tree can be computed and displayed on the tree protection fence during construction. Once the value is computed it can be written down on a weatherproof placard and placed on the tree protection fencing. The monetary replacement value of a specimen tree can be computed in two different ways. 
B.  The "replacement" value of the tree is defined as the cost to replace ..... a tree. Compute the value by taking the diameter of the specimen tree and match it to the existing credit unit value for that tree. The result is the total number of credit units attributed to the specimen tree. For this example the tree was removed without prior Director approval, therefore the Tree Density Unit for the specimen tree must be multiplied by two. Take the total and divide by .6 (a 3-inch caliper replacement tree is worth .6 units). The result is the number of trees necessary to replace the specimen tree. Multiply the number of trees needed by the cost of the tree including planting, labor and materials. The result is the total cost to replace the specimen tree or "the value" of the specimen tree. 
C.  Example, Given: a 36 inch diameter oak tree. 
1.  Credit Value = 28.4 Credit Units 
2.  A 3 inch caliper replacement tree = .6 credit units(See Table 630.3) 
3.  28.4 times 2 equals 56.8 
4.  56.8 divided by .6 = 94.66 replacement trees needed 
5.  95 × $250.00 (estimated cost) = $23,750 = Value of the tree 
Section 630-80.   Tree Bank Alternative Compliance.
The intent of the requirements of this Section is to ensure that a minimum number of trees are replaced and/ or preserved on newly developed or redeveloped sites. The Tree Bank is an alternative option and may be used only in the event the site tree density or recompense tree requirement cannot be met on-site due to hardship. Hardship must be documented by the developer and presented to the Director before the Tree Bank may be used. The Tree Bank provides two options, which are described in full below. 
630-80.1   Option One, Planting Trees Off-site. Install an equal amount of required Tree Density Units in the form of an approved number of trees on an alternate site. In this case the following criteria shall be observed: 
A.  The Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development, in conjunction with the Tree Advisory Committee, has identified alternate "Option One" sites. The Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development has contacted the owners of these sites and these owners have expressed an interest in receiving trees from the Tree Bank. Persons wishing to use Option One should consult with the Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development to see if their required tree density units can be located on one of these alternate sites. The developer may present the Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development with alternate sites. Planting on individual residential lots is prohibited. 
B.  The developer shall submit a Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan showing a location for the planted trees on the proposed site. The developer shall also provide calculations on the plan for tree density or recompense trees from the developed site. The site plan shall state the size, genus, species, and quantity of trees to be planted. Each tree must be 2 inches caliper at a minimum. For trees in which double recompense is required each tree must be 3 inches caliper at a minimum. Recompense calculations must be shown on plan. 
C.  If the proposed site is not one of the alternate sites, discussed above, an authorization from the title holder of the site indicating that the owner agrees to the planting of trees by the developer upon the site shall also be submitted along with the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. 
D.  Trees are to be maintained and guaranteed for one full year after planting by the developer. Any trees that die during the one year time period must be replaced by the developer. Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established by the International Society of Arboriculture, as included in the "Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual," latest edition. 
630-80.2   Option Two, Monetary Compensation for Trees. A developer may choose to provide the Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development with monetary compensation for trees. If this alternative for the development is chosen, then the following criteria shall be observed: 
A.  Provide tree density calculations on the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. Show the total amount of Tree Density Units that cannot be met on-site. 
B.  Multiply the Tree Density Units that cannot be met on-site by the Monetary Compensation Value. The product of those two numbers shall be provided on the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. Contact the Planning and Development certified arborist or landscape architect for the current Monetary Compensation Value. 
C.  Provide a certified check made payable to Gwinnett County in the amount of the product as listed in item B. above and as provided on the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. Submit the certified check to a Development Plan Review Section Planner along with a copy of the approved Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. 
D.  The monies collected for the Tree Bank Option Two may be used by the Department of Planning and Development, Community Services, and/or Support Services for the planting of trees at parks, greenways, fire stations, and libraries. Alternate planting locations may be approved by the Director of the Department of Planning and Development. 
630-80.3   Standards for Administering these Alternative Compliance Methods. The Director must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall the alternative compliance options be used to comply with any other ordinance requirement than the tree density or specimen tree requirement. The site development permit shall be issued after the Director has approved the request for either compliance option and received the necessary documentation and funds. 
630-80.4   Exclusions. Trees used to meet requirements for parking lots, landscape strips, street frontage buffers, or buffer replanting must be planted on site and are excluded from the Tree Bank procedures. Trees that are required to meet minimum Tree Density Units and/or recompense requirements can be contributed toward the Tree Bank in accordance with Option One or Option Two above. 
Section 630-90.   Redevelopment.
630-90.1  For redeveloped sites the Department of Planning and Development strongly recommends the developer, authorized registered professionals, design professionals and staff schedule a pre-submittal meeting with the department to discuss the potential of the site and any issues that may be present on the site. 
630-90.2  Redeveloped sites shall comply with the buffer and specimen tree requirements as set forth in Chapter 610 and Section 630-70 respectively and provide compliance with parking lot, landscape strip and Tree Density Unit requirements. 
630-90.3  Where the scope of a project results in disturbance, removal, and replacement of 25.1 percent or greater of the site area, a Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan is required. The plan shall show landscape strip planting, parking lot trees, Tree Density Units, buffers and shall comply with the requirements of Chapters 600, 610, 620, 630 and 640 of this UDO. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2014-00002(GCID No. 2014-1014), 11-4-14) 
630-90.4  Where the scope of a project results in disturbance, removal, and replacement of 25 percent or less of the site area, a Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan is required. The plan shall include the existing and proposed landscape conditions that verify compliance with Chapters 600, 610, 620, 630 and 640 of this UDO. 
A.  At a minimum the plan must show the following existing and proposed elements with intent to comply: 
1.  Buffers. 
2.  Landscape strips. 
3.  Parking lot trees. 
4.  Tree Density Units. 
5.  Tree Save Areas. 
B.  Director shall review the proposed Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2014-00002(GCID No. 2014-1014), 11-4-14) 
630-90.5  Disturbance as stated above in Redevelopment Section 630-90 shall include a building replacement where the footprint of the building counts toward the site disturbance. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2014-00002(GCID No. 2014-1014), 11-4-14) 
Section 630-100.   Water-Efficient Design Considerations.
630-100.1  It is the policy of Gwinnett County to encourage individuals or firms who prepare the plans and plats required by this UDO to consider the use of water-efficient landscaping principles and techniques as one of the criterion to be used in plant selection and design. 
630-100.2   Principles and Techniques of Water-Efficient Landscaping (Xeriscaping). The recommended principles and techniques to be considered are as follows: 
A.  Proper Location and Design. Locating plants where they will naturally thrive and not require excessive water and maintenance to survive, as well as grouping plants by water needs, and limiting and concentrating high water using plants. 
B.  Turf Selection. Limiting turf areas, and selecting turf grasses that can survive the variable rainfall conditions in this region. 
C.  Efficient Watering. Once plants are established, avoid watering during periods of normal rainfall and during droughts, watering every week to 10 days or less depending on the drought tolerance of the plants. 
D.  Soil Improvements. Loosening and breaking up the soil beyond the immediate planting area to allow better water absorption and to promote deep roots. 
E.  Mulching. Using mulch to hold moisture in the soil which helps maximize the benefits of watering as well as preventing weeds. 
F.  Plant Selection. Selecting plants native or suitable to the region according to their watering requirements and optimum locations. 
G.  Maintenance. Maintaining the landscape to maximize water conservation such as increasing mowing heights and avoiding fertilizing during dry spells. 
Section 630-20. - Permit Requirements. 
630-20.1   Land Disturbance Permit Required. Land-disturbing activities shall not commence until such activities have been authorized by issuance of an appropriate land disturbance or development permit under the provisions of this UDO. Once a Final Plat has been recorded, land-disturbing activities on residential lots shall not occur until a lot disturbance permit for a specific lot has been obtained. 
630-20.2   Tree Preservation and/or Replacement Plan Required. 
A.  For projects not exempt from the provisions of this Chapter, as described in Section 630-10, a Tree Preservation and/or Replacement Plan shall be submitted along with the Tree Canopy Calculation, and the other documents required by the UDO for the issuance of a Clearing, Clearing and Grubbing, Grading, or Development Permit. 
B.  Tree Preservation and/or Replacement Plans, including the Tree Canopy Calculation, and related documentation shall be reviewed by the Department for conformance to the provisions of this Chapter along with and at the same time as all other plans required for a requested land disturbance permit under the provisions of the UDO. 
C.  Clearing, grading and development activities shall conform in all respects with the approved Tree Preservation and/or Replacement Plan. Any revisions to the proposed development of a property, and any changes reflected in a subsequently submitted permit application, shall be shown on a revised Tree Preservation and/or Replacement Plan and be approved as part of the new or revised permit prior to the commencement of such changed activities. 
630-20.3   Limited Land Disturbing Projects. Projects which propose only limited development activities may be issued a land disturbance permit without a Tree Preservation and/or Replacement Plan under the following circumstances: 
A.  Private or public utility easements and County greenways on public access easements and private or public utility easements shall not be required to submit a Tree Preservation and/or Replacement Plan if the proposed land-disturbing activities are strictly limited to those directly related to the placement of required soil erosion and sedimentation controls, the installation of public or private utilities, the installation of County greenways on public access easements and private or public easements, or other required improvements expressly required by the County or by a condition of zoning, special use, modification, waiver or variance approval. 
B.  Residential recreation areas, individual multifamily residential and attached townhomes (not on individual lots), and non-residential projects (not involving the subdivision of the property) may not be allowed to undertake activities limited to clearing, or clearing and grubbing only, without approval of a Tree Preservation and/or Replacement Plan. Additional areas may be designated by the Department to remain undisturbed as may be reasonably required with consideration given to the proposed use of the property, as well as adjacent properties, in accordance with the Gwinnett County 2030 Unified Plan. 
C.  The limits of clearing or clearing and grubbing shall be established no closer to the boundaries of all said undisturbed areas than the driplines of the trees that are located within said areas. 
D.  For any property for which a Tree Preservation and/or Replacement Plan was not required prior to issuance of a land disturbance permit under the provisions of Subsection 630-20.2, all areas required to be undisturbed shall be provided with protective tree fencing along the limits of clearing or grading which adjoin existing trees in accordance with the provisions found in Subsection 630-50.2. These measures shall be in place prior to beginning clearing or grading activities and shall be maintained throughout the land-disturbing period. 
Section 630-30. - Tree Density Requirements. 
630-30.1   Tree Density Standard. 
A.  On each property for which a Tree Preservation and/or Replacement Plan is required, existing trees shall be retained and new trees shall be planted such that the property shall attain or exceed a Tree Density Standard of 16 Tree Density Units per acre, or 20 Tree Density Units per acre as specified in the Overlay Districts, or 24 Tree Density Units per acre for limited land-disturbing activities (Sections 630-10.4, 5, 6 and 7). 
B.  Trees, both existing and new, shall be reasonably distributed throughout the site, with emphasis on tree groupings to achieve aesthetic results following professional landscaping standards. Trees, including street trees, may be retained or planted for credit within a public street right-of-way. 
C.  Trees located in a stream buffer may be counted toward fulfilling the Tree Density Standard provided the acreage within the stream buffer is included in the calculations used to fulfill the Tree Density Standard. 
D.  Trees, both existing and new, located in a temporary construction buffer may be counted toward fulfilling the Tree Density Standard provided the acreage within the temporary construction buffer is included in the calculations used to fulfill the Tree Density Standard. 
E.  If a specimen tree's Critical Root Zone (CRZ) falls outside of the buffer partial credit may be obtained toward fulfilling the Tree Density Standard. See Section 630-30.5 in this UDO. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2015-00001(GCID No. 2015-0360), 4-28-15) 
630-30.2   Buffer Exclusion in Fulfilling the Tree Density Standard. 
A.  Existing trees proposed to be retained and preserved, and new trees proposed to be planted, in order to meet the buffer requirements as required per Table 610.1, as required by the Supplemental Use Standards, or as a condition of Zoning, Special Use, Variance, or Waiver approval shall not be considered in fulfilling the requirements of Tree Density Standard for the project. 
B.  The acreage within the buffer shall be excluded from the overall acreage used to calculate the Tree Density Standard. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2015-00001(GCID No. 2015-0360), 4-28-15) 
630-30.3   Easement Exclusion. Properties possessing natural gas, petroleum or electric power transmission easements, or major sanitary sewer main (greater than 8 inches in diameter) or water main (greater than 16 inches in diameter) distribution easements, may exclude the land area contained in the easement from the total acreage of the property in fulfilling the Tree Density Standard provided that no improvements (e.g. parking lots, tennis courts, driveways, greenways, storm water detention facilities, etc.) are proposed within the easement. If any improvements are proposed within the easement, then the land area so used within the easement for the improvements, plus an additional 10-feet of land area surrounding the improvements, shall be included in the total acreage of the property to fulfill the Tree Density Standard. 
630-30.4   Lake and Pond Exclusion. Properties with a lake or pond greater than 1 acre in size may exclude the land area contained in the lake or pond from the total acreage of the property in fulfilling the Tree Density Standard. 
630-30.5   Tree Density Standard Calculation. The Tree Density Standard shall be calculated by summing the following credits and dividing by the total acreage of the project included within the limits of the permit application (but excluding any acreage included within a zoning buffer and other land area allowed to be excluded by this Chapter). 
A.  Existing trees. 
1.  Credit for existing trees proposed to be preserved on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the diameter of the tree times the units assigned in Table 630.2. Credit for Existing Trees. Credit shall be given for all trees preserved on a property having a diameter of 3 inches or more, except trees located in a required zoning buffer. Tree sample areas of similar vegetation of 50 square feet or larger may be used as a method of measuring Tree Density Units. 
B.  New trees. 
1.  Credit for new trees proposed to be replaced on the site shall be calculated based on the units assigned in Table 630.4, Credit for Replacement Trees. Credit shall be given for all new trees replaced on a property except for trees 1 inch or less in caliper and new trees planted in a required zoning buffer. Deciduous trees shall be a minimum 2 inches in caliper and evergreen trees shall be a minimum of 6 feet in height. New multi-trunked trees shall only be given credit by measuring the single largest trunk and not the cumulative total of the various trunks. Tree-form shrubs shall not be given credit for satisfying the required Tree Density Standard. 
C.  Specimen trees. 
1.  Credit for specimen trees preserved on the site shall be calculated based on the units assigned in Table 630.3, Credit for Specimen Trees. When multi-trunked specimen trees split below diameter at breast height the trunk shall be measured at the narrowest point below the split. 
2.  The Critical Root Zone (CRZ) shall include no less than the minimum area beneath a tree that must be left undisturbed. The CRZ is a concentric circle centering on the specimen tree's trunk with a radius equal in feet to 1.5 times the number of inches of the trunk's diameter at breast height (4.5 feet) or the dripline, whichever is greater. For example the CRZ for a 24 inch diameter tree trunk is a 36 foot radius concentric circle from the trunk of the tree. However, if the dripline extends further than the 36 foot circle that dripline shall take precedence. 
3.  Credit shall be given for all specimen trees preserved on a property except for those located in a required zoning buffer where partial credit may be given. A specimen tree located within a buffer with a CRZ extending beyond the buffer is allowed partial credit toward Tree Density Units. The partial credit is based on the percentage of CRZ that is outside of the buffer. For example: a 30 inch specimen tree's CRZ extends by 20 percent over the buffer line then the developer receives 20 percent of the credit for a 30 inch existing specimen tree (19.6 × .20 = 3.92 TDU's). 
4.  To determine the percentage of CRZ outside of the buffer, measure the area of the CRZ circle. Then measure the area of CRZ outside of the buffer. Divide the smaller number into the larger number and that is the percentage of CRZ. For example: a specimen tree's CRZ is 6,000 square feet, 1,200 square feet is outside of the buffer. Divide 1,200 by 6,000 and the answer is .2 or 20 percent of the CRZ is outside of the buffer. 
D.  Additional credits shall be granted under the following ;ol1;

3.  15.1 — 20 percent disturbance to the CRZ may receive 50 percent credit. 
4.  20.1 — 25 percent disturbance to CRZ may receive 25 percent credit. 
5.  Any proposed disturbance to the specimen tree's CRZ from 25.1 to 30 percent may receive credit based upon what type of disturbance is proposed. Any proposed disturbance and specialty cut slopes shall be reviewed by the Director. 
a.  For example: Given a 36 inch specimen tree whose critical root zone is proposed to be disturbed by 15.4 percent: Table 630.3 assigns a 36 inch specimen tree 28.4 tree density units (TDU's). That tree may receive credit for 50 percent of 28.4 TDU's which is equivalent to 14.2 TDU's. 
B.  When critical root zone disturbance exceeds 30 percent the Director is hereby authorized to determine recompense. 
C.  In the event a specimen tree's Critical Root Zone has experienced unauthorized impact and the disturbance is documented by photos, the Director is hereby authorized to determine recompense. 
630-70.10   Recompense/Specimen Tree Removal with Director Approval. 
A.  Director Approval is required for removal of specimen trees. The Director is hereby authorized to make a determination whether a specimen tree may be removed. 
1.  If a specimen tree previously identified on the Specimen Tree Concept Plan to be preserved cannot be preserved due to site constraints, the developer shall submit to the Director a statement of hardship alleging a necessity for removal of the specimen tree and site design alternatives. Examples of hardship include, but are not limited to, a tree's proximity to overhead transmission lines and topography after site design options have been exhausted. Hardship factors require due justification and shall include documentation. 
a.  Plans to be submitted to the Director showing hardship justification shall include the following: 
i.  Specimen Tree Survey Plan. 
ii.  Existing and proposed contours. 
iii.  Specimen Tree Concept Plan. 
B.  The Director is hereby authorized to determine recompense requirements when a specimen tree requires removal based on site constraints. Recompense requirements shall not count toward existing specimen Tree Density Units. 
C.  If specimen tree removal is approved by the Director, recompense Tree Density Units generated from removal of a specimen tree(s) shall not be counted toward any landscape requirement such as parking lot, landscape strip, or buffer trees. 
D.  If specimen tree removal is approved by the Director, and if the existing Tree Density Units remaining post construction exceed the required Tree Density Units per acre requirement, recompense Tree Density Units may count toward any additional existing Tree Density Units. 
E.  The Director is hereby authorized to make a final determination whether a tree is a specimen tree or whether it has historical significance. 
F.  Trees shown on plan and planted on site for recompense shall be a minimum of 2 inches in caliper or greater, or a minimum of 6 feet in height or greater at time of planting and may be hardwood or softwood or a combination thereof. 
G.  Trees planted for recompense shall be included in the overall percentage of genus calculations for the site. Refer to Subsection 630-30.5.E. 
630-70.11   Recompense/Specimen Tree Removal without Director Approval. 
A.  If a specimen tree is removed without prior approval from the Director, the penalty to replace that tree is two times the Tree Density Units of the specimen tree removed. Replacement tree(s) shall be 3 inches caliper or greater. 
B.  If a specimen tree is removed without Director Approval with no residual evidence of its condition with the exception of the trunk, the diameter of the trunk will determine if the tree was of specimen quality. Required recompense units shall be two times the Tree Density Units of the specimen tree removed. Replacement trees shall be 3 inches caliper or greater. 
C.  If there is evidence that a specimen tree is removed without plan approval and there is no residual evidence of its condition or trunk diameter, recompense requirements shall be a minimum of two 28-inch hardwood trees. The property owner will be required to plant 34.4 Tree Density Units on site in addition to other site density and landscape requirements. 
630-70.12   Specimen Tree Options. The following are suggested guidelines for successful specimen tree preservation. 
A.  Specimen Tree Value. At the option of developer and contractor a value of the tree can be computed and displayed on the tree protection fence during construction. Once the value is computed it can be written down on a weatherproof placard and placed on the tree protection fencing. The monetary replacement value of a specimen tree can be computed in two different ways. 
B.  The "replacement" value of the tree is defined as the cost to replace ..... a tree. Compute the value by taking the diameter of the specimen tree and match it to the existing credit unit value for that tree. The result is the total number of credit units attributed to the specimen tree. For this example the tree was removed without prior Director approval, therefore the Tree Density Unit for the specimen tree must be multiplied by two. Take the total and divide by .6 (a 3-inch caliper replacement tree is worth .6 units). The result is the number of trees necessary to replace the specimen tree. Multiply the number of trees needed by the cost of the tree including planting, labor and materials. The result is the total cost to replace the specimen tree or "the value" of the specimen tree. 
C.  Example, Given: a 36 inch diameter oak tree. 
1.  Credit Value = 28.4 Credit Units 
2.  A 3 inch caliper replacement tree = .6 credit units(See Table 630.3) 
3.  28.4 times 2 equals 56.8 
4.  56.8 divided by .6 = 94.66 replacement trees needed 
5.  95 × $250.00 (estimated cost) = $23,750 = Value of the tree 
Section 630-80.   Tree Bank Alternative Compliance.
The intent of the requirements of this Section is to ensure that a minimum number of trees are replaced and/ or preserved on newly developed or redeveloped sites. The Tree Bank is an alternative option and may be used only in the event the site tree density or recompense tree requirement cannot be met on-site due to hardship. Hardship must be documented by the developer and presented to the Director before the Tree Bank may be used. The Tree Bank provides two options, which are described in full below. 
630-80.1   Option One, Planting Trees Off-site. Install an equal amount of required Tree Density Units in the form of an approved number of trees on an alternate site. In this case the following criteria shall be observed: 
A.  The Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development, in conjunction with the Tree Advisory Committee, has identified alternate "Option One" sites. The Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development has contacted the owners of these sites and these owners have expressed an interest in receiving trees from the Tree Bank. Persons wishing to use Option One should consult with the Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development to see if their required tree density units can be located on one of these alternate sites. The developer may present the Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development with alternate sites. Planting on individual residential lots is prohibited. 
B.  The developer shall submit a Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan showing a location for the planted trees on the proposed site. The developer shall also provide calculations on the plan for tree density or recompense trees from the developed site. The site plan shall state the size, genus, species, and quantity of trees to be planted. Each tree must be 2 inches caliper at a minimum. For trees in which double recompense is required each tree must be 3 inches caliper at a minimum. Recompense calculations must be shown on plan. 
C.  If the proposed site is not one of the alternate sites, discussed above, an authorization from the title holder of the site indicating that the owner agrees to the planting of trees by the developer upon the site shall also be submitted along with the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. 
D.  Trees are to be maintained and guaranteed for one full year after planting by the developer. Any trees that die during the one year time period must be replaced by the developer. Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established by the International Society of Arboriculture, as included in the "Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual," latest edition. 
630-80.2   Option Two, Monetary Compensation for Trees. A developer may choose to provide the Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development with monetary compensation for trees. If this alternative for the development is chosen, then the following criteria shall be observed: 
A.  Provide tree density calculations on the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. Show the total amount of Tree Density Units that cannot be met on-site. 
B.  Multiply the Tree Density Units that cannot be met on-site by the Monetary Compensation Value. The product of those two numbers shall be provided on the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. Contact the Planning and Development certified arborist or landscape architect for the current Monetary Compensation Value. 
C.  Provide a certified check made payable to Gwinnett County in the amount of the product as listed in item B. above and as provided on the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. Submit the certified check to a Development Plan Review Section Planner along with a copy of the approved Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. 
D.  The monies collected for the Tree Bank Option Two may be used by the Department of Planning and Development, Community Services, and/or Support Services for the planting of trees at parks, greenways, fire stations, and libraries. Alternate planting locations may be approved by the Director of the Department of Planning and Development. 
630-80.3   Standards for Administering these Alternative Compliance Methods. The Director must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall the alternative compliance options be used to comply with any other ordinance requirement than the tree density or specimen tree requirement. The site development permit shall be issued after the Director has approved the request for either compliance option and received the necessary documentation and funds. 
630-80.4   Exclusions. Trees used to meet requirements for parking lots, landscape strips, street frontage buffers, or buffer replanting must be planted on site and are excluded from the Tree Bank procedures. Trees that are required to meet minimum Tree Density Units and/or recompense requirements can be contributed toward the Tree Bank in accordance with Option One or Option Two above. 
Section 630-90.   Redevelopment.
630-90.1  For redeveloped sites the Department of Planning and Development strongly recommends the developer, authorized registered professionals, design professionals and staff schedule a pre-submittal meeting with the department to discuss the potential of the site and any issues that may be present on the site. 
630-90.2  Redeveloped sites shall comply with the buffer and specimen tree requirements as set forth in Chapter 610 and Section 630-70 respectively and provide compliance with parking lot, landscape strip and Tree Density Unit requirements. 
630-90.3  Where the scope of a project results in disturbance, removal, and replacement of 25.1 percent or greater of the site area, a Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan is required. The plan shall show landscape strip planting, parking lot trees, Tree Density Units, buffers and shall comply with the requirements of Chapters 600, 610, 620, 630 and 640 of this UDO. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2014-00002(GCID No. 2014-1014), 11-4-14) 
630-90.4  Where the scope of a project results in disturbance, removal, and replacement of 25 percent or less of the site area, a Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan is required. The plan shall include the existing and proposed landscape conditions that verify compliance with Chapters 600, 610, 620, 630 and 640 of this UDO. 
A.  At a minimum the plan must show the following existing and proposed elements with intent to comply: 
1.  Buffers. 
2.  Landscape strips. 
3.  Parking lot trees. 
4.  Tree Density Units. 
5.  Tree Save Areas. 
B.  Director shall review the proposed Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2014-00002(GCID No. 2014-1014), 11-4-14) 
630-90.5  Disturbance as stated above in Redevelopment Section 630-90 shall include a building replacement where the footprint of the building counts toward the site disturbance. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2014-00002(GCID No. 2014-1014), 11-4-14) 
Section 630-100.   Water-Efficient Design Considerations.
630-100.1  It is the policy of Gwinnett County to encourage individuals or firms who prepare the plans and plats required by this UDO to consider the use of water-efficient landscaping principles and techniques as one of the criterion to be used in plant selection and design. 
630-100.2   Principles and Techniques of Water-Efficient Landscaping (Xeriscaping). The recommended principles and techniques to be considered are as follows: 
A.  Proper Location and Design. Locating plants where they will naturally thrive and not require excessive water and maintenance to survive, as well as grouping plants by water needs, and limiting and concentrating high water using plants. 
B.  Turf Selection. Limiting turf areas, and selecting turf grasses that can survive the variable rainfall conditions in this region. 
C.  Efficient Watering. Once plants are established, avoid watering during periods of normal rainfall and during droughts, watering every week to 10 days or less depending on the drought tolerance of the plants. 
D.  Soil Improvements. Loosening and breaking up the soil beyond the immediate planting area to allow better water absorption and to promote deep roots. 
E.  Mulching. Using mulch to hold moisture in the soil which helps maximize the benefits of watering as well as preventing weeds. 
F.  Plant Selection. Selecting plants native or suitable to the region according to their watering requirements and optimum locations. 
G.  Maintenance. Maintaining the landscape to maximize water conservation such as increasing mowing heights and avoiding fertilizing during dry spells. 
Section 630-40. - Tree Canopy Calculation Requirement. 
630-40.1  The tree canopy calculation requirement is required for all new developments and existing developments adding structural or site improvements. 
630-40.2  b>Tree Canopy Calculation. 
A.  The tree canopy shall be calculated by assigning square feet of canopy to each tree proposed and each tree preserved. Square feet of canopy can be found in the Tree Species List in Section 4 of the UDO Appendix. Stands of three or more existing trees can be computed with polygons and given in terms of square feet. Both existing and newly planted trees located in buffers shall be counted. Include buffer trees, landscape strip trees, parking lot trees and any tree preserved or replaced within the site in the tree canopy calculation. 
B.  Add the total square feet of canopy. Take the total site acreage and convert that to square feet. Divide the total square feet of canopy into the total square feet for the site and list it as a percentage. Provide these calculations on the Tree Preservation and/or Replacement plan. There is no minimum or maximum tree canopy percentage required at this time. 
Example of Tree Canopy Calculation. 

 
Section 630-50.   Tree Preservation and Replacement Requirements.
The following guidelines and standards shall apply to trees proposed to be preserved for credit toward meeting the minimum required Tree Density Standard on a property and to all boundary trees extending into permitting property. 
630-50.1   Tree Protection Areas. 
A.  The root system is generally within the dripline or Critical Root Zone. To protect these critical roots, a Tree Protection Area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained. 
B.  The Tree Protection Area shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree canopy as defined by the dripline or Critical Root Zone of the tree or group of trees collectively. 
C.  Site Utility and Grading Plans shall clearly indicate that the Tree Protection Areas will not be disturbed. 
D.  Construction site activities such as parking, materials storage, concrete washout, burnhole placement, etc., shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within Tree Protection Areas.

5.  Any proposed disturbance to the specimen tree's CRZ from 25.1 to 30 percent may receive credit based upon what type of disturbance is proposed. Any proposed disturbance and specialty cut slopes shall be reviewed by the Director. 
a.  For example: Given a 36 inch specimen tree whose critical root zone is proposed to be disturbed by 15.4 percent: Table 630.3 assigns a 36 inch specimen tree 28.4 tree density units (TDU's). That tree may receive credit for 50 percent of 28.4 TDU's which is equivalent to 14.2 TDU's. 
B.  When critical root zone disturbance exceeds 30 percent the Director is hereby authorized to determine recompense. 
C.  In the event a specimen tree's Critical Root Zone has experienced unauthorized impact and the disturbance is documented by photos, the Director is hereby authorized to determine recompense. 
630-70.10   Recompense/Specimen Tree Removal with Director Approval. 
A.  Director Approval is required for removal of specimen trees. The Director is hereby authorized to make a determination whether a specimen tree may be removed. 
1.  If a specimen tree previously identified on the Specimen Tree Concept Plan to be preserved cannot be preserved due to site constraints, the developer shall submit to the Director a statement of hardship alleging a necessity for removal of the specimen tree and site design alternatives. Examples of hardship include, but are not limited to, a tree's proximity to overhead transmission lines and topography after site design options have been exhausted. Hardship factors require due justification and shall include documentation. 
a.  Plans to be submitted to the Director showing hardship justification shall include the following: 
i.  Specimen Tree Survey Plan. 
ii.  Existing and proposed contours. 
iii.  Specimen Tree Concept Plan. 
B.  The Director is hereby authorized to determine recompense requirements when a specimen tree requires removal based on site constraints. Recompense requirements shall not count toward existing specimen Tree Density Units. 
C.  If specimen tree removal is approved by the Director, recompense Tree Density Units generated from removal of a specimen tree(s) shall not be counted toward any landscape requirement such as parking lot, landscape strip, or buffer trees. 
D.  If specimen tree removal is approved by the Director, and if the existing Tree Density Units remaining post construction exceed the required Tree Density Units per acre requirement, recompense Tree Density Units may count toward any additional existing Tree Density Units. 
E.  The Director is hereby authorized to make a final determination whether a tree is a specimen tree or whether it has historical significance. 
F.  Trees shown on plan and planted on site for recompense shall be a minimum of 2 inches in caliper or greater, or a minimum of 6 feet in height or greater at time of planting and may be hardwood or softwood or a combination thereof. 
G.  Trees planted for recompense shall be included in the overall percentage of genus calculations for the site. Refer to Subsection 630-30.5.E. 
630-70.11   Recompense/Specimen Tree Removal without Director Approval. 
A.  If a specimen tree is removed without prior approval from the Director, the penalty to replace that tree is two times the Tree Density Units of the specimen tree removed. Replacement tree(s) shall be 3 inches caliper or greater. 
B.  If a specimen tree is removed without Director Approval with no residual evidence of its condition with the exception of the trunk, the diameter of the trunk will determine if the tree was of specimen quality. Required recompense units shall be two times the Tree Density Units of the specimen tree removed. Replacement trees shall be 3 inches caliper or greater. 
C.  If there is evidence that a specimen tree is removed without plan approval and there is no residual evidence of its condition or trunk diameter, recompense requirements shall be a minimum of two 28-inch hardwood trees. The property owner will be required to plant 34.4 Tree Density Units on site in addition to other site density and landscape requirements. 
630-70.12   Specimen Tree Options. The following are suggested guidelines for successful specimen tree preservation. 
A.  Specimen Tree Value. At the option of developer and contractor a value of the tree can be computed and displayed on the tree protection fence during construction. Once the value is computed it can be written down on a weatherproof placard and placed on the tree protection fencing. The monetary replacement value of a specimen tree can be computed in two different ways. 
B.  The "replacement" value of the tree is defined as the cost to replace ..... a tree. Compute the value by taking the diameter of the specimen tree and match it to the existing credit unit value for that tree. The result is the total number of credit units attributed to the specimen tree. For this example the tree was removed without prior Director approval, therefore the Tree Density Unit for the specimen tree must be multiplied by two. Take the total and divide by .6 (a 3-inch caliper replacement tree is worth .6 units). The result is the number of trees necessary to replace the specimen tree. Multiply the number of trees needed by the cost of the tree including planting, labor and materials. The result is the total cost to replace the specimen tree or "the value" of the specimen tree. 
C.  Example, Given: a 36 inch diameter oak tree. 
1.  Credit Value = 28.4 Credit Units 
2.  A 3 inch caliper replacement tree = .6 credit units(See Table 630.3) 
3.  28.4 times 2 equals 56.8 
4.  56.8 divided by .6 = 94.66 replacement trees needed 
5.  95 × $250.00 (estimated cost) = $23,750 = Value of the tree 
Section 630-80.   Tree Bank Alternative Compliance.
The intent of the requirements of this Section is to ensure that a minimum number of trees are replaced and/ or preserved on newly developed or redeveloped sites. The Tree Bank is an alternative option and may be used only in the event the site tree density or recompense tree requirement cannot be met on-site due to hardship. Hardship must be documented by the developer and presented to the Director before the Tree Bank may be used. The Tree Bank provides two options, which are described in full below. 
630-80.1   Option One, Planting Trees Off-site. Install an equal amount of required Tree Density Units in the form of an approved number of trees on an alternate site. In this case the following criteria shall be observed: 
A.  The Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development, in conjunction with the Tree Advisory Committee, has identified alternate "Option One" sites. The Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development has contacted the owners of these sites and these owners have expressed an interest in receiving trees from the Tree Bank. Persons wishing to use Option One should consult with the Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development to see if their required tree density units can be located on one of these alternate sites. The developer may present the Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development with alternate sites. Planting on individual residential lots is prohibited. 
B.  The developer shall submit a Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan showing a location for the planted trees on the proposed site. The developer shall also provide calculations on the plan for tree density or recompense trees from the developed site. The site plan shall state the size, genus, species, and quantity of trees to be planted. Each tree must be 2 inches caliper at a minimum. For trees in which double recompense is required each tree must be 3 inches caliper at a minimum. Recompense calculations must be shown on plan. 
C.  If the proposed site is not one of the alternate sites, discussed above, an authorization from the title holder of the site indicating that the owner agrees to the planting of trees by the developer upon the site shall also be submitted along with the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. 
D.  Trees are to be maintained and guaranteed for one full year after planting by the developer. Any trees that die during the one year time period must be replaced by the developer. Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established by the International Society of Arboriculture, as included in the "Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual," latest edition. 
630-80.2   Option Two, Monetary Compensation for Trees. A developer may choose to provide the Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development with monetary compensation for trees. If this alternative for the development is chosen, then the following criteria shall be observed: 
A.  Provide tree density calculations on the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. Show the total amount of Tree Density Units that cannot be met on-site. 
B.  Multiply the Tree Density Units that cannot be met on-site by the Monetary Compensation Value. The product of those two numbers shall be provided on the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. Contact the Planning and Development certified arborist or landscape architect for the current Monetary Compensation Value. 
C.  Provide a certified check made payable to Gwinnett County in the amount of the product as listed in item B. above and as provided on the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. Submit the certified check to a Development Plan Review Section Planner along with a copy of the approved Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. 
D.  The monies collected for the Tree Bank Option Two may be used by the Department of Planning and Development, Community Services, and/or Support Services for the planting of trees at parks, greenways, fire stations, and libraries. Alternate planting locations may be approved by the Director of the Department of Planning and Development. 
630-80.3   Standards for Administering these Alternative Compliance Methods. The Director must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall the alternative compliance options be used to comply with any other ordinance requirement than the tree density or specimen tree requirement. The site development permit shall be issued after the Director has approved the request for either compliance option and received the necessary documentation and funds. 
630-80.4   Exclusions. Trees used to meet requirements for parking lots, landscape strips, street frontage buffers, or buffer replanting must be planted on site and are excluded from the Tree Bank procedures. Trees that are required to meet minimum Tree Density Units and/or recompense requirements can be contributed toward the Tree Bank in accordance with Option One or Option Two above. 
Section 630-90.   Redevelopment.
630-90.1  For redeveloped sites the Department of Planning and Development strongly recommends the developer, authorized registered professionals, design professionals and staff schedule a pre-submittal meeting with the department to discuss the potential of the site and any issues that may be present on the site. 
630-90.2  Redeveloped sites shall comply with the buffer and specimen tree requirements as set forth in Chapter 610 and Section 630-70 respectively and provide compliance with parking lot, landscape strip and Tree Density Unit requirements. 
630-90.3  Where the scope of a project results in disturbance, removal, and replacement of 25.1 percent or greater of the site area, a Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan is required. The plan shall show landscape strip planting, parking lot trees, Tree Density Units, buffers and shall comply with the requirements of Chapters 600, 610, 620, 630 and 640 of this UDO. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2014-00002(GCID No. 2014-1014), 11-4-14) 
630-90.4  Where the scope of a project results in disturbance, removal, and replacement of 25 percent or less of the site area, a Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan is required. The plan shall include the existing and proposed landscape conditions that verify compliance with Chapters 600, 610, 620, 630 and 640 of this UDO. 
A.  At a minimum the plan must show the following existing and proposed elements with intent to comply: 
1.  Buffers. 
2.  Landscape strips. 
3.  Parking lot trees. 
4.  Tree Density Units. 
5.  Tree Save Areas. 
B.  Director shall review the proposed Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2014-00002(GCID No. 2014-1014), 11-4-14) 
630-90.5  Disturbance as stated above in Redevelopment Section 630-90 shall include a building replacement where the footprint of the building counts toward the site disturbance. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2014-00002(GCID No. 2014-1014), 11-4-14) 
Section 630-100.   Water-Efficient Design Considerations.
630-100.1  It is the policy of Gwinnett County to encourage individuals or firms who prepare the plans and plats required by this UDO to consider the use of water-efficient landscaping principles and techniques as one of the criterion to be used in plant selection and design. 
630-100.2   Principles and Techniques of Water-Efficient Landscaping (Xeriscaping). The recommended principles and techniques to be considered are as follows: 
A.  Proper Location and Design. Locating plants where they will naturally thrive and not require excessive water and maintenance to survive, as well as grouping plants by water needs, and limiting and concentrating high water using plants. 
B.  Turf Selection. Limiting turf areas, and selecting turf grasses that can survive the variable rainfall conditions in this region. 
C.  Efficient Watering. Once plants are established, avoid watering during periods of normal rainfall and during droughts, watering every week to 10 days or less depending on the drought tolerance of the plants. 
D.  Soil Improvements. Loosening and breaking up the soil beyond the immediate planting area to allow better water absorption and to promote deep roots. 
E.  Mulching. Using mulch to hold moisture in the soil which helps maximize the benefits of watering as well as preventing weeds. 
F.  Plant Selection. Selecting plants native or suitable to the region according to their watering requirements and optimum locations. 
G.  Maintenance. Maintaining the landscape to maximize water conservation such as increasing mowing heights and avoiding fertilizing during dry spells. 
Section 630-50. - Tree Preservation and Replacement Requirements.

5.  Any proposed disturbance to the specimen tree's CRZ from 25.1 to 30 percent may receive credit based upon what type of disturbance is proposed. Any proposed disturbance and specialty cut slopes shall be reviewed by the Director. 
a.  For example: Given a 36 inch specimen tree whose critical root zone is proposed to be disturbed by 15.4 percent: Table 630.3 assigns a 36 inch specimen tree 28.4 tree density units (TDU's). That tree may receive credit for 50 percent of 28.4 TDU's which is equivalent to 14.2 TDU's. 
B.  When critical root zone disturbance exceeds 30 percent the Director is hereby authorized to determine recompense. 
C.  In the event a specimen tree's Critical Root Zone has experienced unauthorized impact and the disturbance is documented by photos, the Director is hereby authorized to determine recompense. 
630-70.10   Recompense/Specimen Tree Removal with Director Approval. 
A.  Director Approval is required for removal of specimen trees. The Director is hereby authorized to make a determination whether a specimen tree may be removed. 
1.  If a specimen tree previously identified on the Specimen Tree Concept Plan to be preserved cannot be preserved due to site constraints, the developer shall submit to the Director a statement of hardship alleging a necessity for removal of the specimen tree and site design alternatives. Examples of hardship include, but are not limited to, a tree's proximity to overhead transmission lines and topography after site design options have been exhausted. Hardship factors require due justification and shall include documentation. 
a.  Plans to be submitted to the Director showing hardship justification shall include the following: 
i.  Specimen Tree Survey Plan. 
ii.  Existing and proposed contours. 
iii.  Specimen Tree Concept Plan. 
B.  The Director is hereby authorized to determine recompense requirements when a specimen tree requires removal based on site constraints. Recompense requirements shall not count toward existing specimen Tree Density Units. 
C.  If specimen tree removal is approved by the Director, recompense Tree Density Units generated from removal of a specimen tree(s) shall not be counted toward any landscape requirement such as parking lot, landscape strip, or buffer trees. 
D.  If specimen tree removal is approved by the Director, and if the existing Tree Density Units remaining post construction exceed the required Tree Density Units per acre requirement, recompense Tree Density Units may count toward any additional existing Tree Density Units. 
E.  The Director is hereby authorized to make a final determination whether a tree is a specimen tree or whether it has historical significance. 
F.  Trees shown on plan and planted on site for recompense shall be a minimum of 2 inches in caliper or greater, or a minimum of 6 feet in height or greater at time of planting and may be hardwood or softwood or a combination thereof. 
G.  Trees planted for recompense shall be included in the overall percentage of genus calculations for the site. Refer to Subsection 630-30.5.E. 
630-70.11   Recompense/Specimen Tree Removal without Director Approval. 
A.  If a specimen tree is removed without prior approval from the Director, the penalty to replace that tree is two times the Tree Density Units of the specimen tree removed. Replacement tree(s) shall be 3 inches caliper or greater. 
B.  If a specimen tree is removed without Director Approval with no residual evidence of its condition with the exception of the trunk, the diameter of the trunk will determine if the tree was of specimen quality. Required recompense units shall be two times the Tree Density Units of the specimen tree removed. Replacement trees shall be 3 inches caliper or greater. 
C.  If there is evidence that a specimen tree is removed without plan approval and there is no residual evidence of its condition or trunk diameter, recompense requirements shall be a minimum of two 28-inch hardwood trees. The property owner will be required to plant 34.4 Tree Density Units on site in addition to other site density and landscape requirements. 
630-70.12   Specimen Tree Options. The following are suggested guidelines for successful specimen tree preservation. 
A.  Specimen Tree Value. At the option of developer and contractor a value of the tree can be computed and displayed on the tree protection fence during construction. Once the value is computed it can be written down on a weatherproof placard and placed on the tree protection fencing. The monetary replacement value of a specimen tree can be computed in two different ways. 
B.  The "replacement" value of the tree is defined as the cost to replace ..... a tree. Compute the value by taking the diameter of the specimen tree and match it to the existing credit unit value for that tree. The result is the total number of credit units attributed to the specimen tree. For this example the tree was removed without prior Director approval, therefore the Tree Density Unit for the specimen tree must be multiplied by two. Take the total and divide by .6 (a 3-inch caliper replacement tree is worth .6 units). The result is the number of trees necessary to replace the specimen tree. Multiply the number of trees needed by the cost of the tree including planting, labor and materials. The result is the total cost to replace the specimen tree or "the value" of the specimen tree. 
C.  Example, Given: a 36 inch diameter oak tree. 
1.  Credit Value = 28.4 Credit Units 
2.  A 3 inch caliper replacement tree = .6 credit units(See Table 630.3) 
3.  28.4 times 2 equals 56.8 
4.  56.8 divided by .6 = 94.66 replacement trees needed 
5.  95 × $250.00 (estimated cost) = $23,750 = Value of the tree 
Section 630-80. - Tree Bank Alternative Compliance. 
The intent of the requirements of this Section is to ensure that a minimum number of trees are replaced and/ or preserved on newly developed or redeveloped sites. The Tree Bank is an alternative option and may be used only in the event the site tree density or recompense tree requirement cannot be met on-site due to hardship. Hardship must be documented by the developer and presented to the Director before the Tree Bank may be used. The Tree Bank provides two options, which are described in full below. 
630-80.1   Option One, Planting Trees Off-site. Install an equal amount of required Tree Density Units in the form of an approved number of trees on an alternate site. In this case the following criteria shall be observed: 
A.  The Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development, in conjunction with the Tree Advisory Committee, has identified alternate "Option One" sites. The Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development has contacted the owners of these sites and these owners have expressed an interest in receiving trees from the Tree Bank. Persons wishing to use Option One should consult with the Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development to see if their required tree density units can be located on one of these alternate sites. The developer may present the Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development with alternate sites. Planting on individual residential lots is prohibited. 
B.  The developer shall submit a Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan showing a location for the planted trees on the proposed site. The developer shall also provide calculations on the plan for tree density or recompense trees from the developed site. The site plan shall state the size, genus, species, and quantity of trees to be planted. Each tree must be 2 inches caliper at a minimum. For trees in which double recompense is required each tree must be 3 inches caliper at a minimum. Recompense calculations must be shown on plan. 
C.  If the proposed site is not one of the alternate sites, discussed above, an authorization from the title holder of the site indicating that the owner agrees to the planting of trees by the developer upon the site shall also be submitted along with the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. 
D.  Trees are to be maintained and guaranteed for one full year after planting by the developer. Any trees that die during the one year time period must be replaced by the developer. Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established by the International Society of Arboriculture, as included in the "Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual," latest edition. 
630-80.2   Option Two, Monetary Compensation for Trees. A developer may choose to provide the Gwinnett County Department of Planning and Development with monetary compensation for trees. If this alternative for the development is chosen, then the following criteria shall be observed: 
A.  Provide tree density calculations on the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. Show the total amount of Tree Density Units that cannot be met on-site. 
B.  Multiply the Tree Density Units that cannot be met on-site by the Monetary Compensation Value. The product of those two numbers shall be provided on the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. Contact the Planning and Development certified arborist or landscape architect for the current Monetary Compensation Value. 
C.  Provide a certified check made payable to Gwinnett County in the amount of the product as listed in item B. above and as provided on the Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. Submit the certified check to a Development Plan Review Section Planner along with a copy of the approved Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. 
D.  The monies collected for the Tree Bank Option Two may be used by the Department of Planning and Development, Community Services, and/or Support Services for the planting of trees at parks, greenways, fire stations, and libraries. Alternate planting locations may be approved by the Director of the Department of Planning and Development. 
630-80.3   Standards for Administering these Alternative Compliance Methods. The Director must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall the alternative compliance options be used to comply with any other ordinance requirement than the tree density or specimen tree requirement. The site development permit shall be issued after the Director has approved the request for either compliance option and received the necessary documentation and funds. 
630-80.4   Exclusions. Trees used to meet requirements for parking lots, landscape strips, street frontage buffers, or buffer replanting must be planted on site and are excluded from the Tree Bank procedures. Trees that are required to meet minimum Tree Density Units and/or recompense requirements can be contributed toward the Tree Bank in accordance with Option One or Option Two above. 
Section 630-90. - Redevelopment. 
630-90.1  For redeveloped sites the Department of Planning and Development strongly recommends the developer, authorized registered professionals, design professionals and staff schedule a pre-submittal meeting with the department to discuss the potential of the site and any issues that may be present on the site. 
630-90.2  Redeveloped sites shall comply with the buffer and specimen tree requirements as set forth in Chapter 610 and Section 630-70 respectively and provide compliance with parking lot, landscape strip and Tree Density Unit requirements. 
630-90.3  Where the scope of a project results in disturbance, removal, and replacement of 25.1 percent or greater of the site area, a Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan is required. The plan shall show landscape strip planting, parking lot trees, Tree Density Units, buffers and shall comply with the requirements of Chapters 600, 610, 620, 630 and 640 of this UDO. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2014-00002(GCID No. 2014-1014), 11-4-14) 
630-90.4  Where the scope of a project results in disturbance, removal, and replacement of 25 percent or less of the site area, a Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan is required. The plan shall include the existing and proposed landscape conditions that verify compliance with Chapters 600, 610, 620, 630 and 640 of this UDO. 
A.  At a minimum the plan must show the following existing and proposed elements with intent to comply: 
1.  Buffers. 
2.  Landscape strips. 
3.  Parking lot trees. 
4.  Tree Density Units. 
5.  Tree Save Areas. 
B.  Director shall review the proposed Tree Preservation and/or Tree Replacement Plan. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2014-00002(GCID No. 2014-1014), 11-4-14)

(Ord. No. UDOA2014-00002(GCID No. 2014-1014), 11-4-14) 
Section 630-100. - Water-Efficient Design Considerations. 
630-100.1  It is the policy of Gwinnett County to encourage individuals or firms who prepare the plans and plats required by this UDO to consider the use of water-efficient landscaping principles and techniques as one of the criterion to be used in plant selection and design. 
630-100.2   Principles and Techniques of Water-Efficient Landscaping (Xeriscaping). The recommended principles and techniques to be considered are as follows: 
A.  Proper Location and Design. Locating plants where they will naturally thrive and not require excessive water and maintenance to survive, as well as grouping plants by water needs, and limiting and concentrating high water using plants. 
B.  Turf Selection. Limiting turf areas, and selecting turf grasses that can survive the variable rainfall conditions in this region. 
C.  Efficient Watering. Once plants are established, avoid watering during periods of normal rainfall and during droughts, watering every week to 10 days or less depending on the drought tolerance of the plants. 
D.  Soil Improvements. Loosening and breaking up the soil beyond the immediate planting area to allow better water absorption and to promote deep roots. 
E.  Mulching. Using mulch to hold moisture in the soil which helps maximize the benefits of watering as well as preventing weeds. 
F.  Plant Selection. Selecting plants native or suitable to the region according to their watering requirements and optimum locations. 
G.  Maintenance. Maintaining the landscape to maximize water conservation such as increasing mowing heights and avoiding fertilizing during dry spells.

Editor's note— Ord. No. UDOA2015-00001, adopted April 28, 2015, repealed the former chapter 700, §§ 700-10—700-50, and enacted a new chapter 700 as set out herein. The former chapter 700 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ordinance No. UDO2014, adopted February 25, 2014. 

Section 700-10. - General Provisions. 
700-10.1   Findings. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of Gwinnett County are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
C.  Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can: 
1.  Protect human life and health. 
2.  Minimize damage to private property. 
3.  Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains. 
4.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
D.  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a), have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, Gwinnett County, Georgia, establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property. 
700-10.2   Requirements. The requirements of Chapter 700 shall be applicable to all Areas of Special Flood Hazard within the jurisdiction of Gwinnett County. 
700-10.3   Purpose. It is the purpose of Chapter 700 to protect, maintain, and enhance the public health, safety, environment, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions: 
A.  Restricting or prohibiting uses or activities which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to flooding or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion. 
B.  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or renovation. 
C.  Limiting the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters. 
D.  Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage. 
E.  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
F.  Protecting the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas. 
700-10.4   Flood Area Maps and Studies. For the purposes of defining and determining "Area of Special Flood Hazard," "Areas of Future-conditions Flood Hazard," "Areas of Shallow Flooding," " Base Flood Elevations," "Floodplains," "Floodways," "Future-conditions Flood Elevations," "Future-conditions Floodplains," potential flood hazard or risk categories as shown on FIRM maps, and other terms used in Chapter 700, the following documents and sources may be used for such purposes and are adopted by reference thereto: 
A.  The Flood Insurance Study (FIS), dated September 26, 2006, or most current study, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto. 
B.  Other studies which may be relied upon for establishment of the base flood elevation (BFE) or delineation of the base or one-percent (100-year) floodplain and flood-proned areas, including:

The requirements of Chapter 700 are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of Chapter 700 imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
700-10.11   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by Chapter 700 is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. Chapter 700 does not imply that land outside the special flood hazard or flood prone areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. Chapter 700 shall not create liability on the part of Gwinnett County or on the part of any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that results from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
700-10.12   Duties and Responsibilities of Ordinance Administrator. As the administrator of Chapter 700, the duties of the Director of the Department of Planning and Development or the Director's designee shall include, but shall not be limited to: 
A.  Review all development applications and permits to assure that the requirements of Chapter 700 have been satisfied and to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. 
B.  Require that copies of all necessary permits from governmental agencies from which approval is required by federal or state law, including but not limited to Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334, be provided and maintained on file.

Section 700-20. - Permit Application and Procedures. 
700-20.1   General Permit Procedures. An application for a development permit on any property where a special flood hazard area is located or is proposed to be altered or disturbed in any way shall include, but not be limited to, the following in addition to the requirements of Section 330 of this UDO: plans drawn to scale of the property showing the floodplain, floodway and the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, and drainage facilities. 
700-20.2   Encroachments. 
A.  Application Procedure. 
1.  An application for a development permit which proposes any encroachment into or alteration of a floodway shall, in addition to the requirements of Chapter 330 of this UDO, require submittal to the Department of complete plans and engineering calculations as required by Chapter 700 for "no rise" certification. 
2.  The Department shall review and authorize such floodway encroachments prior to the issuance of a development permit and shall obtain from the applicant an engineering "no-rise" certification signed by a professional engineer stating that the proposed development will not create any change to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths. 
3.  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries or base flood elevations, no permit authorizing an encroachment into or the alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the Department until an affirmative Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) or Conditional Letter of Map Amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable, is issued and "no rise" certification is approved by the Department. 
4.  An application for a map revision shall be submitted first to the Department. Record drawings and calculations shall be required to be provided to the Department by the applicant at the time of completion of the floodway encroachment. 
5.  Payment of any review fees associated with the review and approval of the encroachment shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Final plats or certificates of occupancy shall not be issued by the Department until an affirmative Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) or Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), whichever is applicable, is issued. 
B.  Flood Levels Resulting from Floodway Encroachments. Located within Areas of Special Flood Hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris, or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  Encroachments are prohibited, including but not limited to fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other developments, within the regulatory floodway except for activities specifically allowed in Subsection 700-20.2.B.2 below. 
2.  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
C.  In areas where the floodplain has been established but the base flood elevation (BFE) and/or the floodway has not been established on FIS maps, no encroachments into areas of special flood hazard, including fill or structures, shall be authorized unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided to the Department demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the floodplain more than 0.01 foot at any point. The study shall be submitted as a revision/amendment to the FIS maps showing the BFE and the floodway. Approval of the revision/amendment must be received before the final plat can be approved or a certificate of occupancy can be issued. 
D.  In areas beyond the limits of study on the flood boundary and floodways maps or FIRM, which contains a watercourse, and have greater than 100 acres of surface drainage area above the property, no increase in flood elevations off-site shall be authorized. 
700-20.3   Other Permits or Approvals. 
A.  Copies of any additional federal or state permits or approvals as may be required by the Corps of Engineers, Georgia Department of Natural Resources, FEMA, or others shall be provided by the developer upon their approval and maintained on file in the Department of Planning and Development. 
B.  The Department shall notify adjacent communities and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

(Ord. No. UDOA2015-00001(GCID No. 2015-0360), 4-28-15) 
Chapter 800. - Stormwater Management 

Section 800-10. - Stormwater Management General. 
800-10.1  Stormwater treatment facilities shall be designed so that their peak release rates, when combined with those of all detention bypass areas in the same basin, produce peak flow rates and flow velocities at the site's boundary line no greater than those which occurred at the same location for pre-developed conditions unless the project meets conditions specified in Section 800-40.2 and 800-40.3. 
800-10.2  The positive effects of stormwater management via on-site stormwater treatment facilities diminish rapidly as the distance downstream from the point of discharge increases, and the smaller the facility's contribution is, as a percentage of the total runoff contributing to downstream flow, the shorter the distance downstream that the benefits are realized. Because of these limitations, on-site stormwater treatment is effective at controlling flooding only when flow from the facility is a significant percentage of the total flow at the point of interest, and only if the point of interest is immediately downstream. The concepts of immediately downstream and significant percentage of total flow are inseparable. The portion of a receiving watercourse (one which receives and conveys runoff from a site) which lies downstream from the site to the point where the area of the site is 10 percent of the total drainage area, shall generally be considered to constitute that portion of the watercourse which is immediately downstream. 
800-10.3  Peak flow rate control shall normally be provided only for the 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 25-year frequency storm events. The 100-year event shall be provided when failure to do so would result in flooding of other habitable dwellings, property damage, or public access and/or utility interruption. 
800-10.4  For any stormwater analysis, the composite "C" (Rational Method) or CN (SCS Method) used for analysis of pre-development conditions shall not exceed a forested condition unless prior approval via variance has been obtained from the Department. A pre-design conference between the authorized registered professional and appropriate Department of Planning and Development personnel, which may in certain straightforward cases be conducted via the telephone, is required. 
800-10.5  Rational Method Runoff Coefficients and SCS Curve Number calculations used for analysis of pre- and post-development conditions shall be consistent with those shown in the Gwinnett County Stormwater Systems and Facilities Installation Standards and Specifications. 
Section 800-20. - Stormwater Management Documentation. 
800-20.1  The purpose of Stormwater Management Documentation is to support the development of the project site using Best Management Practices and diligent engineering. The report must follow the guidelines set forth in the Gwinnett County Stormwater Systems and Facilities Installation Standards and Specifications and is required for all developments. The report shall be certified by a qualified registered professional registered in the State of Georgia. 
800-20.2  A stormwater management analysis shall identify the locations and quantities of stormwater runoff entering and exiting the site for both pre- and post-developed conditions. Analysis of the off-site properties shall anticipate future development in addition to addressing existing conditions. 
800-20.3  For the purposes of these regulations, the words "downstream" and "analysis" shall have the following meanings. The analysis of downstream conditions in the report shall address each and every point or area along the project site's boundaries at which runoff will exit the property. The analysis shall focus on the portion of the drainageway "immediately" downstream from the project. This area shall extend downstream from the project to a point in the drainage basin where the project area is 10 percent of the total basin area. The analysis shall be in accordance with the Gwinnett County Stormwater Systems and Facilities Installation Standards and Specifications. 
800-20.4  The following criteria shall be evaluated by the authorized registered professional preparing the Stormwater Management Report, and in determining whether or not stormwater treatment is required for any portion of any site: 
A.  Existing land uses downstream. 
B.  Anticipated future land uses downstream. 
C.  Magnitude of increase in peak flows due to development. 
D.  Presence of existing drainage problems. 
E.  Capacity of existing and anticipated drainage systems. 
F.  Creation of concentrated flows where none had occurred previously. 
G.  Availability of feasible locations for stormwater treatment facilities. 
H.  Existing flows generated off-site which pass through the project site. 
I.  The nature of the receiving watercourse. 
800-20.5  Where detention for a proposed project is provided in a regional detention facility that was permitted prior to January 1, 2001, the developer shall provide a copy of the original study that met the regulations at the time the facility was permitted. If the approved study cannot be found, then the authorized registered professional shall provide a recreated study. The project shall be exempt from restudy and any modifications required to meet regulations effective after January 1, 2001 provided the proposed project is in keeping with the intent of the original detention study and the stormwater treatment facility is properly maintained to provide the original design volume. 
800-20.6  When a development uses an existing facility where the last approved certification and record drawing of the facility was over 18 months prior to the new development's submittal, the authorized registered professional shall provide one of the following: 
A.  A new survey, drawing and certification showing that the outlet structure is constructed as approved and the flood storage and water quality volume of the facility is equal to or greater than the volume required when the facility was approved. 
B.  Construction plans and calculations showing that the outlet structure will function as designed and the flood storage and water quality volume of the facility will be equal to or greater than the volume required when the facility was approved once proposed maintenance has been performed. 
C.  A new record survey, drawing, study and certification showing that the facility meets the development requirements when the facility was approved. 
800-20.7  All design related to stormwater shall be in accordance with the Gwinnett County Stormwater Systems and Facilities Installation Standards and Specifications. 
800-20.8  A certified record survey of each facility shall be prepared by an authorized registered professional currently registered in the State of Georgia. A certified record drawing of the facility shall be prepared based upon this survey. The authorized registered professional shall certify that the facility functions hydraulically as designed. The record drawing shall be submitted to the Department at least one week prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy or Final Plat approval (as appropriate to the project). Record drawings of off-site facilities shall be recorded at least one week prior to the recording of the Final Plat. 
800-20.9  The applicant shall certify and provide documentation that all other applicable environmental permits have been acquired for the site prior to approval of the Stormwater Management Report. 
Section 800-30. - Water Quality. 
800-30.1  All projects, unless exempt pursuant to Section 800-30.3 below, that meet one or more of the following criteria, shall provide water quality treatment based on the modeled Total Suspended Solids (TSS) load of the project for post construction conditions. The determination of the TSS load shall be in accordance with the Stormwater Systems and Facilities Installation Standards and Specifications. The modeled TSS load shall not exceed 850 pounds/acre/year. 
A.  New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover. 
B.  New development that involves land-disturbing activities of 1 acre or more. 
C.  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in Subsection 800-30.1.A. above, if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
D.  Utility projects such as electrical, gas, water and sanitary sewer line installations that do not require stormwater treatment. 
E.  Activities to restore and enhance stream bank stability, vegetation, water quality and/or aquatic habitat, so long as native vegetation and bioengineering techniques are used. 
800-30.2  Runoff from any new development, regardless of size, that is defined by the Director of Water Resources to be a hotspot land use or activity shall be adequately treated and addressed through the use of structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
800-30.3  The following activities are exempt from providing treatment: 
A.  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project. 
B.  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures. 
C.  Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the Director of Water Resources. 
800-30.4  Requirements for a certified record survey and applicable addendum as necessary to the Stormwater Management Report shall be the same for water quality facilities as for stormwater treatment facilities in Section 800-20.8. 
800-30.5  All stormwater treatment facilities designed to treat water quality, shall also detain the one-year storm runoff, for the area draining to the pond, for 24 hours. For the project, this volume called the channel protection volume, shall be equal to or greater than the one-year storm runoff volume from the project. 
Section 800-40. - Stormwater Peak Flow Design Criteria. 
800-40.1  Whenever a Stormwater Management Report indicates that an adverse impact from stormwater runoff is expected to result from the development of a property, that project shall be provided with stormwater detention facilities. The meaning of "adverse impact" shall apply when pre-development flows did not cause difficulties and post-development flows do. Difficulties shall include, but not be limited to, situations where 25-year velocities exceed the non-erosive velocity of the stream, habitable structures are shown to be subject to increased depth of flooding for any frequency up to and including the regulatory flood, and stormwater facilities that cannot carry the design storm in accordance with these regulations. 
800-40.2  Stormwater detention facilities required in Section 800-40.1 shall be provided, unless the authorized registered professional certifies and provides certified documentation supporting the conclusion to the Director that at least one of the following is true and correct as applicable. 
A.  The non-detained, post-development runoff will leave the project site as sheet flow, and will not have an adverse impact upon downstream properties. The increase for a 25-year storm should not exceed 1 cfs over a length perpendicular to the flow of 100 feet. 
B.  The effect of stormwater treatment would be to concentrate flows where sheet flow had occurred under pre-developed conditions, and any impact of increased sheet flows upon downstream properties would be less adverse than that which would result from the concentrated flows from a stormwater treatment facility even if energy dissipation devices were employed. 
C.  The undetained flow will pass through downstream properties, in drainage easements obtained by the developer, to an existing stormwater treatment facility which has been designed to manage the upstream property's runoff or to the point in the downstream analysis (see Section 800-20.3) which shows that stormwater treatment is not required. 
D.  Where the site runoff will flow directly into a stream or lake without crossing off-site properties: 
1.  24-hour detention of the one-year storm is required if water quality protection is required for the project. In this case, the post-development peak flows in the receiving channel may exceed pre-development flows by the smaller value of up to 0.1 percent of the pre-development flows or 3 cfs in the downstream analysis. 
2.  Only peak detention for the two-year through the 25-year storm is not required if the downstream analysis using timing of the hydrographs shows no adverse impact from the exit of the site to the point immediately downstream from the project in the drainage basin where the project area is 10 percent of the total drainage basin area. 
800-40.3  Should the authorized registered professional conclude that stormwater detention may not be necessary because of anticipated compliance with Section 800-40.2, rigid compliance with all of the following criteria is mandatory: 
A.  A stormwater management report shall always be required whether or not stormwater detention is required. 
B.  If the applicant proposes to show that the stormwater treatment requirement may be eliminated for all or a portion of a project, then a pre-submittal conference with the Department staff is required prior to preparation and submittal of construction plans for the project. 
C.  At the pre-submittal conference with the staff, the consultant shall be prepared to discuss the downstream analysis findings as follows: 
1.  The affected stream must be analyzed downstream from the project to a point where the project area is 10 percent of the total drainage basin. The analysis must include all culverts, obstructions, existing and potential erosion problems, elevations of existing improvements, and any other existing modifications to natural conditions. 
2.  If the existing downstream conditions are overburdened by the pre-developed flows in the stream, then stormwater treatment shall be required unless the developer elects to eliminate the downstream overburdened conditions at his or her expense when the development occurs. 
3.  If there are any existing drainage complaints downstream, then stormwater treatment shall be required unless the developer elects to minimize the conditions causing the complaint at his or her expense when the development occurs. 
800-40.4  All stormwater treatment facility hydrologic and hydraulic analysis and design calculations shall be certified by the qualified registered professional. The design shall be in accordance with the Gwinnett County Stormwater Systems and Facilities Installation Standards and Specifications. 
800-40.5  All stormwater treatment facilities designed to treat peak flow, water quality or a combination of the two shall control the peak flow rates associated with storms having 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 25-year return frequencies so that flows from the developed site do not exceed those associated with pre-development conditions at the project boundary nor increase the peak flows downstream from the project to the point in the drainage basin where the project area is 10 percent of the total basin. Where adverse impacts, as defined in Section 800-40.1, occur during the 100-year storm, the 100-year storm shall also be regulated. 
800-40.6  The hydrologic methodology used for any given project shall conform to the Gwinnett County Stormwater Systems and Facilities Installation Standards and Specifications. 
800-40.7  Runoff coefficients and runoff Curve Numbers used for pre- and post-development conditions shall be consistent with those shown in the Gwinnett County Stormwater Systems and Facilities Installation Standards and Specifications. 
800-40.8  The USGS Method shall be used to check the magnitude of peak flows. 
800-40.9  Calculations shall be provided showing how all times of concentration or lag times were computed, both for pre- and post-developed conditions. Likewise, adequate support must be provided for all composite runoff coefficients or curve numbers used. 
800-40.10  All stormwater treatment facilities designed to treat peak flow, shall also detain the one-year storm runoff, for the area draining to the pond, for 24 hours. For the project, this volume called the channel protection volume, shall be equal to or greater than the one-year storm runoff volume from the project. 
Section 800-50. - Stormwater Treatment Facility Outlet Devices. 
800-50.1  Because of the variables that may be associated with the choice of an outlet device for any given condition, the design consultant is responsible for the appropriate selection of the device which is consistent with the current policies and procedures of the Department and in accordance with the following documents as applicable: The Gwinnett County Stormwater Systems and Facilities Installation Standards and Specifications; The UDO Standard Drawings. Variations to the outlet device are subject to the review and approval process of the Department. 
800-50.2  The Department will include in its consideration the ease of maintenance, longevity of the system, freedom from congestion, practicality, and aesthetics in its review of the outlet device. 
800-50.3  Orifices shall not be smaller than 3 inches in diameter. An orifice smaller than 15 inches in diameter shall be protected by a trash rack. A trash rack protecting an orifice shall have a surface area of at least 10 square feet. Design shall be in accordance with the Gwinnett County Stormwater Systems and Facilities Installation Standards and Specifications. No opening in the trash rack shall have an area more than one-half the size of the area of the orifice being protected. Two-stage trash racks, or screens having progressively smaller openings placed in series, are suggested. To facilitate outlet operation, curved or inclined trash racks designed to allow debris to rise with the water level are preferred. In all cases, trash racks shall be either hinged or removable to facilitate maintenance operations. 
800-50.4  If the primary stormwater treatment facility outlet is a conduit through a dam, and there is not an orifice, weir-box, or other flow-control device affixed to the upstream end, then the conduit shall be analyzed for both inlet and outlet control conditions. If an orifice or weir-box is affixed, then the conduit shall be analyzed to determine if any flows will occur for which outlet control conditions in the conduit, rather than the hydraulic characteristics of the flow-control structure, will determine the total flows occurring. In any case where the conduit through the dam is less than 15 inches in diameter, the trash rack provisions of Section 800-50.3 above shall be followed. 
800-50.5  Unless the 100-year maximum flow velocity in a conduit through a dam forming a pond or a lake is less than 10 feet per second, and the hydraulic grade line for the 100-year condition is at or below the crown of the conduit for at least 90 percent of its length, the conduit must be equal or superior to Class V reinforced concrete pipe in its structural characteristics. 
Section 800-60. - Emergency Overflow Requirements. 
800-60.1  For every type of stormwater treatment facility, a planned safe flowpath must be provided for conveyance of flows of water in excess of those for which the stormwater treatment facility was designed. In many instances, this function can be provided through installation of an emergency spillway. Emergency spillways are usually excavated open channels, either vegetated or paved with reinforced concrete. 
800-60.2  Every earthen dam shall be provided with an open-channel emergency spillway, unless all of the following apply: 
A.  The principal spillway is a closed conduit having a cross-sectional area that can pass 125 percent of the 100-year storm routed peak discharge. 
B.  The principal spillway is a closed conduit having a cross-sectional area of at least 1 square foot per each 3 acres of drainage area, or a maximum of 20 square feet of surface area, whichever is less. 
C.  The principal spillway capacity is at least equal to the capacity required for an open channel emergency spillway. 
D.  The low point of the dam crest is not in a fill section except for roadway embankments. 
E.  A trash rack or other debris protection is provided on the outlet control. 
800-60.3  Any portion of any emergency spillway excavated into a dam embankment or other fill section must be paved. Pavement material shall be either reinforced concrete or asphalt, as dictated by the design life of the dam and the potential consequences of its failure. Any portion of any emergency spillway excavated into natural ground shall be vegetated in accordance with the practices described in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia." 
800-60.4  In determining the necessary dimensions of an open-channel spillway for a normally-dry basin, a pond, or a lake, the methodology contained in the "Earth Emergency Spillway Design Data" section of the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" should be used. 
800-60.5  Emergency spillway capacity for dams shall be as follows: 
A.  For normally-dry detention basins, ponds, and lakes, having a dam height of less than 9 feet and which are incapable of impounding more than 20 acre-feet of water, and for which the probable sequences of dam failure are not severe, an emergency spillway should be provided. Its capacity should be at least equal to the routed 100-year peak flow out of the stormwater treatment facility assuming the principal spillway is blocked. 
B.  For normally-dry detention basins, ponds, and lakes, having a dam height of 9 feet or more and which are capable of impounding 20 acre-feet or more of water, an emergency spillway should be provided. Its capacity should be at least equal to the greater of either the routed 100-year peak flow rate out of the facility assuming the principal spillway is blocked, or the routed one-fourth PMF hydrograph out of the facility. In cases when State or Federal regulations may require greater spillway capacity, those more stringent regulations shall govern. 
800-60.6  Emergency overflow for non-earthen dams may take the form of planned structure overtopping. In such cases, however, care must be taken to prevent flows from eroding supporting soils along the toe of or immediately downstream from the dam so as to cause it to be undermined. The profile of the top of the dam shall be so designed as to prevent flows along the ends of the structure that might result in abutment erosion. 
Section 800-70. - Stormwater Treatment Facility Location and Easement Criteria. 
800-70.1  For purposes of this UDO, a stormwater treatment facility shall be deemed to consist of the area within the maximum design ponding limits unless a modification application is approved, the dam (if one) including all embankment slopes and wall footings (if applicable), primary and emergency outlet works, any drainage and access easements, and any energy dissipation devices. The intent of these regulations is to ensure that the extent of the facility is defined to allow flooding, access and maintenance. Granting of a modification will not nullify these regulations when the facility is a wet pond or lake, the area within the maximum design ponding limits is reduced to a few feet inside the normal pool elevation, and easements are provided on the perimeter properties to allow for flooding, access and maintenance around the lake. In addition, granting of the modification shall only be considered when the wet pond is an amenity and under no circumstances shall the dam and outlet structure lie on private property. 
800-70.2  Stormwater treatment facilities, to the greatest extent feasible, shall be located so as to minimize the amount of flow generated on the project site that bypasses the facility. 
800-70.3  No portion of any stormwater treatment facility shall disturb any required (as opposed to voluntary) buffer, landscape strip, or tree protection area, except that natural bottom stormwater treatment ponds and its appurtenant structures, which require no grading and removal of trees, may encroach into a required construction buffer. 
800-70.4  The 100-year ponding limits of a stormwater treatment facility shall not encroach upon a public right-of-way. 
800-70.5  Stormwater treatment facilities may be located within utility easements or rights-of-way, or encroach upon utility easements or rights-of-way, upon receipt by the Department of written permission from both the property and utility owners. 
800-70.6  Stormwater treatment facilities may be constructed within open space areas required under this UDO, if the following criteria are met: 
A.  Ownership of the area will be held by a Qualified Property Owner's Association, Homeowners Association, or other private parties. 
B.  Permanent structures, such as buildings and swimming pools, will not be constructed within the boundaries of the stormwater treatment facility. 
C.  Stormwater treatment facilities within recreation areas will be approved only if the design of the area includes recreation amenities such as ball fields, tennis courts, grassed open areas or other similar improvements. The intent is to provide recreation facilities with stormwater treatment as a secondary feature. 
D.  Permanent stormwater treatment features shall not interfere with the intended used of the recreation amenity, (i.e., a ditch or large swale shall not traverse a ball field, an inlet structure shall not be in a tennis court, etc.). 
800-70.7  If a residential subdivision is provided with an on-site stormwater treatment facility not located within an open space area as specified in Section 800-70.6 above, a mandatory property owners' association shall be established for its ownership and maintenance. The facility shall be located on a single lot within the development and owned by the property owners association. The lot shall have a minimum of 30 feet of public road frontage and a minimum lot width of 30 feet. Access to the facility shall be located on this lot. If the project is provided with an off-site stormwater treatment facility, a mandatory property owners' association shall be established for its maintenance. The association bylaws shall be recorded concurrently with the recording of a Final Subdivision Plat. 
800-70.8  A non-residential subdivision is not required to locate an on-site stormwater treatment facility on a separate lot. The property owners served by a stormwater treatment facility that provides detention for more than one property owner or is located off-site shall enter into a maintenance agreement acceptable to the County for the facility's maintenance. However, if desired by the developer, the facility may be located on a separate lot if it is owned and maintained by a mandatory property owners' association. 
800-70.9  Stormwater treatment facility easement requirements: 
A.  In a non-residential subdivision or project, an easement at least 20 feet in width shall be required so as to provide access to all stormwater treatment facilities from a public street. 
B.  In a residential subdivision, an easement at least 30 feet in width shall be required so as to provide access to all stormwater treatment facilities from a public street. 
800-70.10  Stormwater treatment facility access easement requirements:

B.  The minimum drive width shall be 15 feet. 
C.  The drive shall be grassed or paved. 
D.  The maximum slope shall be 20 percent (5H:1V). 
E.  Access easements may be combined with drainage easements containing an open channel; however, the combined easement shall be a minimum of 30 feet in width and shall be wide enough for the drainage channel and the drive. 
F.  A drive to the bottom of the pond shall be provided when the facility is over 10 feet deep from the bench elevation or the facility is wider than 50 feet as measured from bench to bench. 
800-70.11  Every normally-dry detention basin, lake, or parking lot stormwater treatment facility shall be completely enclosed within a drainage easement. The drainage easement shall extend at least 10 feet beyond the 100-year flooding limits of the stormwater treatment facility.

B.  In a residential subdivision, it shall be the responsibility of the mandatory property owner's association to maintain the operational characteristics of any facility constructed on their property for stormwater detention pursuant to County requirements, to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt or debris. 
C.  In a non-residential subdivision or project served by a stormwater treatment facility that provides detention for more than one property or by an off-site facility, the property owners shall enter into a maintenance agreement with the County for maintenance of the operational characteristics of the facility pursuant to County requirements, to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt or debris. 
D.  In a non-residential project with an on-site stormwater treatment facility which serves only that project, the property owner shall be responsible to maintain the operational characteristics of the facility pursuant to County requirements, to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt or debris. 
E.  Where no maintenance agreement has been recorded, it shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain the operational characteristics of any facility constructed on their property for stormwater management pursuant to County requirements, to keep the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of obstruction, silt or debris. 
F.  Prior to the issuance of a Development Permit, the owner shall submit a detailed schedule of long-term maintenance and inspection activities. This schedule of activities shall be incorporated into a maintenance agreement to be entered into between the County and the owner. The schedule shall describe all maintenance and inspection activities and the parties responsible. The maintenance agreement shall be in a form acceptable to the County and shall be recorded in the deed records of the Clerk of Superior Court of Gwinnett County. 
800-70.13  Stormwater treatment facilities shall be constructed in accordance with plans reviewed and approved by the Department, and shall be in place and inspected prior to the initiation of other improvements. If the stormwater treatment facility is planned to be a lake, temporary stormwater treatment facilities shall be provided and shall remain in place until such time as the lake has become effective in providing stormwater management. The construction shall be in accordance with the Gwinnett County Stormwater Systems and Facilities Installation Standards and Specifications. 
800-70.14  Extended stormwater treatment facility easement requirements shall be as specified in Section 800-70.9 of this UDO with the change that the easement enclosing the facility shall be named a Best Management Practice (BMP) easement. 
A.  Facility easement requirements shall be as specified in Section 800-70.9 of this UDO with the exception that the easement enclosing the facility shall be named a Best Management Practice (BMP) easement. 
B.  Upland Area Easements in non-residential subdivisions that are claimed as undisturbed upland areas for the site shall be recorded in an easement acceptable to the County. These areas shall be left in a natural, undisturbed condition except for walking trails. 
800-70.15  Extended stormwater treatment facility maintenance requirements shall be as specified in Section 800-70.12. 
Prior to or concurrent with the recording of a Final Plat for a subdivision, or issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for a non-subdivision project, the developer shall provide acceptable surety such as a bond or letter of credit providing for the maintenance of the facility for a period of not less than 24 months. The amount of the surety shall be the greater of 50 percent of construction costs of the facility or 100 percent of the cost to clean out the facility. At the end of 24 months, the County may require the surety to be renewed due to anticipated maintenance caused by such concerns as future construction activity in the basin draining to the facility. A renewed surety may be required up to a total maximum of 10 years. The surety for a facility shall be renewed during the ten years until: 
A.  The surface water drainage area within the project has undergone final stabilization and all planned construction activity has been completed. 
B.  All stormwater runoff in the surface water drainage area within the project is coming from undisturbed or stabilized areas. 
C.  All stormwater facilities and infrastructure construction has been completed and temporary or permanent vegetation is established.

800-70.16  Extended stormwater treatment facility location criteria shall be as follows: 
A.  Extended stormwater treatment facility location criteria shall be as specified for stormwater treatment facilities in Section 800-70 of this UDO. 
B.  In a residential subdivision, the following Best Management Practices (BMP's) must be located on a separate lot in accordance with Section 800-70 if not located on a recreation area lot as specified in Section 800-70.6: 
1.  Extended stormwater treatment ponds. 
2.  Retention ponds. 
3.  Sand filters. 
4.  Constructed wetlands. 
5.  Infiltration trenches. 
6.  Oil/grit separators. 
800-70.17  The detention methodology used for a parking lot stormwater treatment facility design shall conform to the Gwinnett County Stormwater Systems and Facilities Installation Standards and Specifications. Parking lot stormwater treatment areas shall be located so as to restrict ponding to areas other than parking spaces near buildings, and to not encroach upon entrance drives. Any parking lot used for stormwater treatment facilities shall generally be of one of the following: 
A.  Depressed areas of pavement at drop inlet locations. 
B.  Ponding areas along sections of raised curbing. The curbing in these areas is usually higher than a standard curbed section. 
C.  Alternative surfaces with storage capacity, as approved by the Department. 
800-70.18  The detention methodology used for an underground or rooftop stormwater treatment facility design shall conform to the Gwinnett County Stormwater Systems and Facilities Installation Standards and Specifications. In the case of rooftop stormwater treatment, permissible structural loads and weatherproofing shall be governed by the Georgia State Building Code as may be amended by the County. 
800-70.19  Stormwater management and sediment trapping functions should be separated whenever possible. Every erosion control design should seek to: first, prevent erosion from occurring; second, trap sediments as close to their sources as possible; and third, provide a second-tier or backup line of defense against sediments leaving the project site. This backup defense will usually consist of check dams and/or sediment basins. Consider the following: 
A.  Whenever a sediment basin and a stormwater treatment facility are both required on the same watercourse, the sediment basin should be located immediately upstream of the stormwater treatment facility. 
B.  In unusual cases where a normally-dry detention basin is planned to be used to trap sediment as well as provide stormwater control, the basin may be undercut to accommodate the sediment so that the required detention characteristics, particularly volume, will be maintained. 
C.  The design of sediment basins shall be in accordance with Appendix C of the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia." 
Section 800-80. - Dams. 
800-80.1  Stormwater treatment facilities which take the form of normally-dry basins, ponds, or lakes usually are created by damming a drainage way or watercourse. Such dams can take a variety of different forms, the most common being earthen embankments and reinforced concrete walls. Each type of dam has different characteristics, and the selection of the most appropriate type for a particular site should be made by an authorized registered professional and based on the physical features of the dam site, the purpose of the dam, the type of impoundment, safety, and maintenance requirements. 
800-80.2  For purposes of this UDO, dams will be addressed separately for each of the three most frequently encountered types of stormwater treatment facilities: normally-dry basins, ponds, and lakes. A normally-dry basin is one designed to impound stormwater runoff for only a brief period of time following a storm event. The vast majority of the time the basin will be completely dry except for any normal stream flows which pass through unimpeded. Lakes and wet ponds, on the other hand, are designed to impound a body of water at least several feet in depth on a more-or-less permanent basis. Lakes and wet ponds vary from one another only in terms of magnitude. The magnitude of a lake is determined primarily from the height of its dam, the size of its contributing drainage area, and the volume of water it is capable of impounding. For purposes of this UDO, a wet pond is any lake having a dam height of less than 9 feet and which is incapable of impounding more than 20 acre-feet of water. 
800-80.3  All dams designed to impound stormwater runoff shall be certified by a professional engineer currently registered in the State of Georgia. 
800-80.4  Dams for normally-dry detention basins shall conform to the following: 
A.  Dams for normally-dry detention basins may be constructed of earth, reinforced concrete, mortared rubble, or other suitable materials. 
B.  The design of any concrete or rubble wall over five feet in height shall be certified by a structural engineer currently registered as a professional engineer in the State of Georgia, and the structural design shall be based on soil tests certified by a professional engineer. 
C.  Any non-earthen structure shall be designed to prevent piping failure through its subgrade and abutments. 
D.  Earthen dams for normally-dry detention basins shall have a top width of no less than eight feet. 
E.  For earthen dams for normally-dry detention basins, there shall be at least 1.5 feet of vertical separation between the 100-year ponding elevation in the basin and the low point on the top of the dam. One foot of this distance is to provide a margin of safety against overtopping of the dam and the other 6 inches is to allow for settlement. Separation is not required for a non-earthen dam if it has been designed to overtop safely. 
F.  More stringent design and construction criteria shall be used for dams for normally-dry detention basins whenever the probable consequences of dam failure are severe. 
800-80.5   Dams for wet ponds shall conform to the following: Any professional engineer responsible for the design of a dam for a wet pond is expected to be knowledgeable of the criteria contained within the Georgia Safe Dams Act , Georgia Department of Natural Resources "Rules for Dam Safety" publication, and the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service's Technical Release No. 60 "Earth Dams and Reservoirs." The provisions of each are to be applied wherever applicable. Applicability shall be determined based upon site-specific constraints and downstream conditions. Consultation with appropriate Department personnel both prior to and throughout the design process is encouraged. 
800-80.6   Dams for lakes shall conform to the following: Any professional engineer responsible for the design of a dam for a lake is expected to be thoroughly familiar with the criteria contained within the Georgia Safe Dams Act , Georgia Department of Natural Resources "Rules for Dam Safety" publication, and the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service's Technical Release No. 60 "Earth Dams and Reservoirs." All design is to be in accordance with the applicable requirements contained in each of the above referenced publications.

E.  Improvements along State Highways. For any development which abuts a state highway or other right-of-way controlled by the State of Georgia, improvements to the roadway and the location and design of any street or driveway providing access from the state highway shall comply with the standards and requirements of the Georgia Department of Transportation. A permit for the proposed access or improvements shall be required to have been approved by the Georgia Department of Transportation and incorporated into the construction drawings for the project prior to issuance of a development permit by the Department. 
F.  Dead End Streets. 
1.  A dead end street shall be provided to the boundary of a subdivision where necessary to provide access to a land-locked abutting property, for planned continuity of future circulation, for improved access for public safety vehicles, or for the extension of public water or other utilities to neighboring lands. Such dead end streets shall be designed so as to allow their reasonable extension, and shall be located so as to be reasonably incorporated into a street design for the neighboring property. The stub street requirement may be waived by the Director. 
2.  Dead end streets on abutting property shall be extended into a proposed subdivision and incorporated into the street design of the development. This requirement may be modified by the Director in cases of serious topographical hardship or dissimilar zoning which would create unacceptable land use conflicts between the two developments. This modification may be conditioned on the provision of easements necessary for the extension of public utilities, the provision of cul-de-sac or other permanent turnaround on the dead end street, or the removal of the dead end street back to its nearest intersection. 
3.  Where a dead end street (other than a cul-de-sac) serves more than three lots, the developer shall be required to provide a temporary vehicular turnaround within the right-of-way. This requirement may be waived if extension of the dead end street is approved and under construction prior to its inclusion in a Final Plat. 
4.  Where a street dead ends at the property boundary and the street exceeds 1000 feet in length, a permanent cul-de-sac shall be required. In this situation, right-of-way to the property boundary shall be required, but the pavement shall not be extended to the property boundary beyond the edge of the paved cul-de-sac turnaround. In no case shall a dead end street exceed 2000 feet in length unless approved by the Department of Transportation due to unusual topographic conditions or property configuration. 
5.  In residential subdivisions, a dead end ("stub") street required under this subsection to provide access to an abutting property may be exempted from construction of roadway improvements and public utilities under the following circumstances: 
a.  No lot within the proposed subdivision will gain access from the "stub" street. 
b.  A Concept Plan has not been submitted or approved on the neighboring tract. 
c.  The "stub" street shall be fully designed as part of the Development Plans. However, the right-of-way shall only be cleared and rough graded in accordance with the approved plans, and all disturbed areas grassed. 
d.  Connections for future extension of all public utilities shall be constructed as part of the subdivision. Curb returns shall be constructed as part of the subdivision. Curb returns shall be provided to the future "stub" street roadway location, and curb and gutter shall be installed across the roadway stub at the right-of-way line (extended). 
e.  The right-of-way for the "stub" street shall be dedicated as part of the Final Plat. Slope easements or construction easements, if required by the street design, shall be shown on the Final Plat. 
G.  Service Roads. Where a development borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, or limited access highway right-of-way or major thoroughfare, a public street may be required to be constructed and dedicated within the development approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way. 
900-20.6   Reserve Strips. Land in private ownership adjacent to public rights-of-way which could control or are intended to control access to streets, alleys, or public lands shall not be permitted unless their control is given to the County under ownership, dedication, or easement conditions approved by the County Attorney or acceptable to the Director. No development shall be designed so as to deny access to abutting properties. 
900-20.7   Street Jogs. 
A.  Street jogs shall either directly align or have offsets as shown in Table 900.3, as measured between centerlines of said streets. 
B.  All Major Thoroughfares shall provide offsets as required by the Department, where alignment is not desirable or feasible, but in no case be spaced less than 600 feet apart as measured between centerlines of said streets. 
Section 900-30.   Project Access Improvements.
900-30.1   Project access improvements for single-family detached, single-family attached, and duplex residential sub-divisions. 
A.  When property that abuts upon an existing or proposed County road is to be developed or redeveloped as a single-family detached, attached, or duplex subdivision and the County street will provide access to the property, project access improvements to the County road (deceleration lanes, turn lanes, etc.) shall be provided by the developer as required herein. 
B.  A deceleration lane shall be required to be provided at each project driveway or subdivision street entrance that is provided street access to a Minor Collector Street or Major Thoroughfare. In the event a street has an existing or proposed median, and the developer desires to construct a median break to serve the subdivision, a left turn lane leading to the median break shall be required to be provided by the developer if approved by the Department of Transportation and shall meet the standards contained herein. The preferred spacing for median breaks shall be 2,000 feet between the centerlines of the openings, and the minimum spacing for median breaks shall be 1,000 feet between centerlines of the openings. Other factors will also be considered, such as distance to other median openings, adjacent land use, expected traffic volumes, and the resulting volume of U-turns that are likely to occur without the median opening. Meeting the spacing criteria is not, in itself, an indication that median openings will be allowed. 
C.  Deceleration lanes shall have a length of 200 feet, with an additional 50 foot taper length, a pavement width of 12 feet (exclusive of curb and gutter) and shall be provided with curb and gutter. Additional right-of-way to accommodate the deceleration lane and an 11 foot shoulder measured from back of curb shall be dedicated by the developer to Gwinnett County at no cost. Associated stormwater infrastructure as deemed necessary by the construction of the deceleration lane shall also be required. 
D.  A left turn lane shall be provided into each project driveway or subdivision street that accesses a Minor Collector or Major Thoroughfare in accordance with the Department of Transportation's "Criteria and Guidelines for Left Turn Lanes". 
E.  Other project access improvements may be required by the Department upon the recommendation of the Department of Transportation in order to ensure adequate site access, pedestrian access, convenience and safety to the motoring public. 
F.  The developer shall be responsible for the relocation of public or private utilities and stormwater infrastructure, as may be occasioned by the required Project Access Improvements. 
900-30.2   Project Access Improvements for Multifamily and Non-residential Developments. 
A.  When property that abuts upon an existing or proposed County road is to be developed or redeveloped for multifamily or non-residential uses and the County road will provide access to the property, project access improvements to the County road (deceleration lanes, turn lanes, etc.) shall be provided by the developer. 
B.  A deceleration lane shall be required to be provided at each project driveway or subdivision street entrance, as applicable, that is provided street access to a Minor Collector Street or Major Thoroughfare. In the event a street has an existing or proposed median, and the developer desires to construct a median break to serve the project, a left turn lane leading to the median break shall be required to be provided by the developer if approved by the Department of Transportation and shall meet the standards contained herein. The preferred spacing for median breaks shall be 2000 feet between the centerlines of the openings, and the minimum spacing for median breaks shall be 1000 feet between centerlines of the openings. Other factors will also be considered, such as distance to other median openings, adjacent land use, expected traffic volumes, and the resulting volume of U-turns that are likely to occur without the median opening. Meeting the spacing criteria is not, in itself, an indication that median opening will be allowed. 
C.  Deceleration lanes shall have a length of 200 feet, with an additional 50 foot taper length, pavement width of 12 feet (exclusive of curb and gutter) and shall be provided with curb and gutter. Additional right-of-way to accommodate the deceleration lane and an 11 foot shoulder shall be dedicated by the developer to Gwinnett County at no cost. Associated drainage improvements as deemed necessary by the construction of the deceleration lane shall also be required.

F.  The developer shall be responsible for the relocation of public or private utilities and stormwater infrastructure, as may be occasioned by the required Project Access Improvements. 
Section 900-40.   Driveway Design Standards.
900-40.1   Angle and Improvements. Driveways shall generally intersect streets at right angles. The portion of a driveway located within a public right-of-way shall be paved. Driveways providing access to parking lots which contain five or more spaces shall be paved in accordance with the parking lot requirements in Chapter 240. 
900-40.2   Driveway Design Standards. Driveways serving single-family detached or duplex residences may be no less than 10 feet wide at the right-of-way line and shall provide a radius to the back of curb or edge of pavement of the roadway of no less than 5 feet. All other driveway curb cuts on public streets shall conform to the standards shown on the driveway details contained in the Standard Drawings in the Appendix of the UDO and by land use type as follows: 
A.  Driveway Detail 1 (32 foot Width, 25 foot Radius) for: 
1.  Commercial and Retail Uses (over 80,000 Square Feet). 
2.  Office/Institutional/Cultural Uses (Over 100,000 Square Feet). 
3.  Multifamily Residential Developments (Over 200 Units). 
4.  Mobile or Manufactured Home Developments (Over 200 Lots). 
5.  Service Stations. 
B.  Driveway Detail 2 (28 foot Width, 25 foot Radius) for: 
1.  Commercial and Retail Use Sites (80,000 Square Feet or Less). 
2.  Office/Institutional/Cultural Use Complexes (100,000 Square Feet or Less). 
3.  Multifamily Residential Developments (200 Units or Fewer). 
4.  Mobile or Manufactured Home Developments (200 Lots or Fewer). 
C.  Driveway Detail 3 (32 foot Width, 40 foot Radius) for: 
1.  Industrial Sites. 
D.  Driveway Detail 4 (Optional Design with Island) for: 
1.  Private Commercial/Office Street Entrances. 
2.  Private Entrances to Multifamily Residential Developments (Over 200 Units). 
3.  Private Entrances to Mobile or Manufactured Home Developments (Over 200 Lots). 
4.  All driveways and driveway curb cuts on State highways shall conform to Georgia Department of Transportation standards. 
900-40.3   Auxiliary Lanes. Along any Major Thoroughfare, a deceleration lane, acceleration lane, larger turning radius, traffic islands, or other devices or designs may be required to avoid specific traffic hazards which would otherwise be created by the proposed driveway location. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2014-00001(GCID No. 2014-0548), 7-22-14) 
900-40.4   Corner Sight Distance. All driveways approaching a Minor Collector or Major Thoroughfare shall provide adequate corner sight distance, and shall meet or exceed the following design standards: 
A.  The sight distance criteria are based on the time required for a vehicle to make a left turn from a stop controlled approach to the Highway (AASHTO Case B1). The time to execute the maneuver is based on recommendations contained in NCHRP Report 383, Intersection Sight Distance. The sight distances, for a two-lane road, are the distances traveled at the arterial speed during 7.5 seconds. The time is increased by 0.5 seconds for each additional lane to be crossed. 
B.  The sight distances given in Table 900.2 are for undivided highways and streets. If the highway or street is divided, the effect of the median should be considered in determining the required sight distance. Based on the conditions, it may be feasible for the crossing maneuver to be done in two stages with a stop in the median. However, the intersection should only be treated in this manner if the signing and marking is accordingly provided. Otherwise, the sight distance requirements should be increased to account for the additional width that must be crossed. See AASHTO Green Book, Chapter 9 Intersections, for adjustments due to grades greater than 3 percent and design vehicles other than passenger cars. 

Table 900.2. Sight Distance. 

 
(Ord. No. UDOA2014-00001(GCID No. 2014-0548), 7-22-14) 
900-40.5   Separation and Spacing. All driveways except those serving residential units on individual lots shall meet the following criteria: 
A.  Minimum separation for driveways, public roads, and side streets: 
Table 900.3. Minimum Separation for Driveways, Public Roads, and Side Streets. 

 
B.  Spacing shall be measured from centerline to centerline of driveways, public roads or side streets. Greater separation may be required for safe operation of intersections and right or left turning lanes. Whenever possible, proposed drive-ways along one side of a street shall coincide with existing or proposed driveways on the opposite side of such street. If offset driveways cannot be avoided, the same driveway spacing criteria as given in Table 900.3 should be provided. Spacing shall be measured from centerline to centerline. If the Highway involved is a divided facility and the driveways do not align with a median crossover, the driveway spacing would only apply to the adjacent driveway on the same side of the Highway as provided in Table 900.3. 
C.  Maximum number of driveways serving a single project: one for each 400 feet of property frontage, or fraction thereof per street, along a major thoroughfare. This is not meant to be a spacing standard but only an expression of the total number of driveways that are permitted serving a single project. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2014-00001(GCID No. 2014-0548), 7-22-14) 
Section 900-50.   Street Intersections.
900-50.1   Angle of Intersection. Intersections shall generally be at right angles and shall not be at an angle of less than 85 degrees, unless approved by the Department, nor less than 80 degrees unless the intersection is signalized, in which case the angle of the intersection may be reduced subject to the review and approval of the Gwinnett County Department of Transportation. 
900-50.2   Maximum Grade. Street intersections should be designed with a flat grade wherever possible, but in no case should the grade exceed 2 percent in normal situations (or 4 percent in topographical hardship situations on local streets). 
900-50.3   Intersection Approaches: Horizontal Alignment. 
A.  New local streets which approach an intersection with a street in a category higher than itself on a horizontal curve having a centerline radius less than 240 feet shall provide a tangent section of roadway at least 30 feet long. Minor Collectors approaching an intersection with a Major Thoroughfare on a horizontal curve having a centerline radius of less than 550 feet shall also provide the 30 foot tangent section. The tangent length shall be measured along the centerline of the street, from the right-of-way line of the intersecting street, extended, to the point of tangency with the centerline of the curve section. 
B.  New Major Thoroughfares shall provide tangent sections at intersections with streets in equal or higher categories as needed to provide adequate stopping distances at their design speeds. 
900-50.4   Intersection Approaches: Vertical Alignment. 
A.  For intersections with local or minor collector streets, a leveling of the street at a grade not exceeding 2 percent shall be provided but no level approach distance is required for streets approaching at less than 7 percent, and a minimum 25 foot level approach distance shall be provided for streets approaching at a grade of 7 percent or more. 
B.  As a street approaches an intersection with a major thoroughfare, there shall be a suitable leveling of the street at a grade not exceeding two percent and for a distance not less than the following minimums, as set forth in Table 900.4 below: 
Table 900.4. Approach Distances at Major Intersections.

900-50.5   Intersection Radii. Intersection radii for roadways measured at back of curb and for the right-of-way lines shall be as set forth in Table 900.5 below. For intersecting streets of different classifications, the larger radii shall be provided. In all cases, adequate right-of-way shall be provided to maintain minimum of 11 feet from back-of-curb. Larger radii may be required for streets intersecting at angles less than 90 degrees. 
Table 900.5. Intersection Radii. 

 
* Intersecting right-of-way lines may be joined by an arc having the minimum radius shown, or by a miter which cuts across the right-of-way lines connecting the points where the required radius would have otherwise been tangent. 
900-50.6   Islands. Islands in street intersections shall conform to the design requirements of the Standard Drawings in the Appendix of the UDO. In no case shall anything in an island extend more than three feet above the street grade within the right-of-way, except traffic regulatory devices and other infrastructure erected or approved by Gwinnett County. No island shall be approved which contains less than 100 square feet. 
900-50.7   Intersection Corner Sight Distance. 
A.  Intersections shall be designed with adequate corner sight distance for each street which approaches a street in an equal or higher street category (except an intersection of two local streets). Where necessary, backslopes shall be flattened and horizontal or vertical curves lengthened to provide the minimum required sight distance. 
B.  The minimum corner sight distance shall meet the standards as shown in Table 900.2 Sight Distance. 
C.  The sight distance criteria are based on the time required for a vehicle to make a left turn from a stop controlled approach to the Highway (AASHTO Case B1). The time to execute the maneuver is based on recommendations contained in NCHRP Report 383, Intersection Sight Distance. The sight distances, for a two-lane road, are the distances traveled at the arterial speed during 7.5 seconds. The time is increased by 0.5 seconds for each additional lane to be crossed. The sight distances given in Table 900.2 are for undivided highways. If the highway is divided, the effect of the median should be considered in determining the required sight distance. Based on the conditions, it may be feasible for the crossing maneuver to be done in two stages with a stop in the median. However, the intersection should only be treated in this manner if the signing and marking is accordingly provided. Otherwise, the sight distance requirements should be increased to account for the additional width that must be crossed. See AASHTO Green Book, Chapter 9 Intersections, for adjustments due to grades greater than 3 percent and design vehicles other than passenger cars. 
900-50.8   Obstructing Visibility at Intersections. In all zoning districts, no fence, wall, structure, shrubbery, or other obstruction to vision between the heights of 3 feet and 15 feet, except utility poles, light or street sign standards or tree trunks shall be permitted within 20 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way lines of streets, roads, highways or railroads. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2015-00001(GCID No. 2015-0360), 4-28-15) 
900-50.9   Turning Lanes at Intersections. Right turning lanes may be required to meet traffic demands or safety concerns. When provided, turning lanes shall meet the following criteria: 
A.  Storage length — A minimum of 150 feet of storage length for turning lanes on any arterial roadway shall be used. A minimum of 100 feet of storage length for turning lanes on all collectors shall be used. 
B.  Taper Length — The minimum taper length shall be 50 feet. 
C.  Left turning lanes from arterial roads shall be subject to longer storage lengths and tapers and as determined on a case by case basis. 
Section 900-60.   Street Design Standards.
900-60.1   Street Grades and Design Speeds. 
A.  Minimum grade for all Local and Minor Collector Streets shall be 1.5 percent. Minimum grades for all major collector and arterial streets shall conform to Georgia Department of Transportation standards and regulations. 
B.  Minimum grade of less than 1.5 percent on a local street may be approved by the Department, based on adequate engineering designs, where at least 1.5 percent cannot reasonably be achieved due to topographical limitations imposed by the land. In such cases, a Record Drawing and such computations as necessary shall be provided after construction to establish that the street will drain in accordance with this UDO. Street sections where unacceptable pooling, excessive spread at catch basins, or other hazardous conditions occur shall be reconstructed or otherwise improved to eliminate such conditions. 
C.  Minimum vehicle design speeds and maximum grades allowable in Gwinnett County by street classification shall be as shown in Table 900.6. 
D.  Maximum grade on any cul-de-sac turnaround shall be 6 percent. 
Table 900.6. Minimum Design Speeds and Maximum Grades. 

 
* Grades between 11 percent and 15 percent shall not exceed a length of 150 feet and shall require an "as graded" survey prior to the installation of the curb or utilities. The distance shall be measured as the tangent length between points of curvature. 
900-60.2   Vertical Street Alignment. 
A.  All changes in street profile grades having algebraic difference greater than one percent shall be connected by a parabolic curve having a minimum length (L) equal to the product of the algebraic difference between the grades in percent (A) and the design constant (K) assigned to the street according to its category (i.e., L=KA). 
B.  Constant (K) values are shown in the Table 900.7 for both desirable and minimum acceptable ("hardship") conditions. In all cases, the "desirable" value shall be used, unless it cannot be achieved due to topographic conditions beyond the developer's control. In such hardship situations, the Department may approve a lesser value to the extent required by the hardship situation, but in no event less than the value shown in Table 900.7 as "minimum." 
Table 900.7. Constant (K) Values for Vertical Curves. 

 
900-60.3   Horizontal Street Alignment. 
A.  All new streets shall adhere to the standards governing horizontal curvature and superelevation as set forth in Table 900.8 below: 
Table 900.8. Horizontal Curves. 

 
* No superelevation will be allowed on Minor Collectors internal to residential subdivisions 
B.  Superelevation for horizontal curves shall be calculated utilizing the following formula: 
R = minimum radius curve 
v = vehicle design speed (MPH) 
e = rate of superelevation (decimal of a foot rise per foot roadway) 
f = side friction factor 
R = v2 / 15 (e + f) 
Vehicle Design Speed (v)  30  40  50  60 
Side Friction Factor (f)   .16  .15  .14  .12 
C.  Widening section along existing streets shall be designed reflecting existing curvature and superelevation, if any, unless the existing street has been included in a specific design by the Gwinnett County Department of Transportation or Georgia Department of Transportation which calls for different standards, in which case the project will be coordinated with the overall design. 
D.  Superelevation runoff. Roadway edge curves shall be provided for tangent runout (bringing edge from a normal crown to centerline elevation) and superelevation runoff (from the end of tangent runout to the point of design superelevation) in accordance with design standards of the Georgia Department of Transportation or other professional engineering standards. 
E.  Tangents and compound curves. Between reverse horizontal curves there shall be not less than the minimum centerline tangents shown in Table 900.9 unless otherwise specified by the Georgia Department of Transportation. Compound radii curves are prohibited. At least the "desirable" length shall be provided unless hardship conditions of topography or property configuration will not allow lengths greater than those shown as "minimum." For compound circular curves, the ratio of the flatter radius to the sharper radius shall not exceed 1.5 to 1. 
Table 900.9. Tangents. 

 
Note: Minimum tangents are based on the distance traveled in 1.7 seconds at the design speed for each category of street. Desirable length is based on distance traveled in 2.0 seconds 
900-60.4   Horizontal and Vertical Clearances. 
A.  Horizontal clearances. 
1.  A shoulder of no less than 11 feet from the back of curb or edge of pavement, appropriately graded and having gentle slopes of not more than 0.5 inch per foot and rounded cross-sectional design shall be maintained along all streets. Beyond the shoulder but within the right-of-way, slopes shall not exceed 1 foot of rise for each 2 feet of horizontal distance on a cut slope, and 1 foot of fall for each 3 feet of horizontal distance on a fill slope. 
2.  Along all public streets, a clear zone shall be provided per current AASHTO standards wherein nothing may be located above ground level except traffic/street signs, public utility structures, driveways, and mail boxes. 
3.  At selected locations, such as the outside of a sharp curve a wider clear zone with greater horizontal clearances provided to any roadside obstruction may be required. 
4.  The Department of Transportation, in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 32-6-51, is authorized to remove or direct the removal of any sign, signal, device, or other structure erected, placed, or maintained on the right-of-way of a public road which because of its nature, construction, or operation constitutes a danger to or interferes with the vision of drivers of motor vehicles. 
B.  Vertical clearances. Vertical clearance at underpasses shall be at least 14.5 feet over the entire roadway width.

Curb returns shall be provided to the future "stub" street roadway location, and curb and gutter shall be installed across the roadway stub at the right-of-way line (extended). 
e.  The right-of-way for the "stub" street shall be dedicated as part of the Final Plat. Slope easements or construction easements, if required by the street design, shall be shown on the Final Plat. 
G.  Service Roads. Where a development borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, or limited access highway right-of-way or major thoroughfare, a public street may be required to be constructed and dedicated within the development approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way. 
900-20.6   Reserve Strips. Land in private ownership adjacent to public rights-of-way which could control or are intended to control access to streets, alleys, or public lands shall not be permitted unless their control is given to the County under ownership, dedication, or easement conditions approved by the County Attorney or acceptable to the Director.

Section 900-40. - Driveway Design Standards. 
900-40.1   Angle and Improvements. Driveways shall generally intersect streets at right angles. The portion of a driveway located within a public right-of-way shall be paved. Driveways providing access to parking lots which contain five or more spaces shall be paved in accordance with the parking lot requirements in Chapter 240. 
900-40.2   Driveway Design Standards. Driveways serving single-family detached or duplex residences may be no less than 10 feet wide at the right-of-way line and shall provide a radius to the back of curb or edge of pavement of the roadway of no less than 5 feet. All other driveway curb cuts on public streets shall conform to the standards shown on the driveway details contained in the Standard Drawings in the Appendix of the UDO and by land use type as follows: 
A.  Driveway Detail 1 (32 foot Width, 25 foot Radius) for: 
1.  Commercial and Retail Uses (over 80,000 Square Feet). 
2.  Office/Institutional/Cultural Uses (Over 100,000 Square Feet). 
3.  Multifamily Residential Developments (Over 200 Units). 
4.  Mobile or Manufactured Home Developments (Over 200 Lots). 
5.  Service Stations. 
B.  Driveway Detail 2 (28 foot Width, 25 foot Radius) for: 
1.  Commercial and Retail Use Sites (80,000 Square Feet or Less). 
2.  Office/Institutional/Cultural Use Complexes (100,000 Square Feet or Less). 
3.  Multifamily Residential Developments (200 Units or Fewer). 
4.  Mobile or Manufactured Home Developments (200 Lots or Fewer). 
C.  Driveway Detail 3 (32 foot Width, 40 foot Radius) for: 
1.  Industrial Sites. 
D.  Driveway Detail 4 (Optional Design with Island) for: 
1.  Private Commercial/Office Street Entrances. 
2.  Private Entrances to Multifamily Residential Developments (Over 200 Units). 
3.  Private Entrances to Mobile or Manufactured Home Developments (Over 200 Lots). 
4.  All driveways and driveway curb cuts on State highways shall conform to Georgia Department of Transportation standards. 
900-40.3   Auxiliary Lanes. Along any Major Thoroughfare, a deceleration lane, acceleration lane, larger turning radius, traffic islands, or other devices or designs may be required to avoid specific traffic hazards which would otherwise be created by the proposed driveway location. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2014-00001(GCID No. 2014-0548), 7-22-14) 
900-40.4   Corner Sight Distance. All driveways approaching a Minor Collector or Major Thoroughfare shall provide adequate corner sight distance, and shall meet or exceed the following design standards: 
A.  The sight distance criteria are based on the time required for a vehicle to make a left turn from a stop controlled approach to the Highway (AASHTO Case B1). The time to execute the maneuver is based on recommendations contained in NCHRP Report 383, Intersection Sight Distance. The sight distances, for a two-lane road, are the distances traveled at the arterial speed during 7.5 seconds. The time is increased by 0.5 seconds for each additional lane to be crossed. 
B.  The sight distances given in Table 900.2 are for undivided highways and streets. If the highway or street is divided, the effect of the median should be considered in determining the required sight distance. Based on the conditions, it may be feasible for the crossing maneuver to be done in two stages with a stop in the median. However, the intersection should only be treated in this manner if the signing and marking is accordingly provided. Otherwise, the sight distance requirements should be increased to account for the additional width that must be crossed. See AASHTO Green Book, Chapter 9 Intersections, for adjustments due to grades greater than 3 percent and design vehicles other than passenger cars. 

Table 900.2. Sight Distance. 

 
(Ord. No. UDOA2014-00001(GCID No. 2014-0548), 7-22-14) 
900-40.5   Separation and Spacing. All driveways except those serving residential units on individual lots shall meet the following criteria: 
A.  Minimum separation for driveways, public roads, and side streets: 
Table 900.3. Minimum Separation for Driveways, Public Roads, and Side Streets. 

 
B.  Spacing shall be measured from centerline to centerline of driveways, public roads or side streets. Greater separation may be required for safe operation of intersections and right or left turning lanes. Whenever possible, proposed drive-ways along one side of a street shall coincide with existing or proposed driveways on the opposite side of such street. If offset driveways cannot be avoided, the same driveway spacing criteria as given in Table 900.3 should be provided. Spacing shall be measured from centerline to centerline. If the Highway involved is a divided facility and the driveways do not align with a median crossover, the driveway spacing would only apply to the adjacent driveway on the same side of the Highway as provided in Table 900.3. 
C.  Maximum number of driveways serving a single project: one for each 400 feet of property frontage, or fraction thereof per street, along a major thoroughfare. This is not meant to be a spacing standard but only an expression of the total number of driveways that are permitted serving a single project. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2014-00001(GCID No. 2014-0548), 7-22-14)

A.  New local streets which approach an intersection with a street in a category higher than itself on a horizontal curve having a centerline radius less than 240 feet shall provide a tangent section of roadway at least 30 feet long. Minor Collectors approaching an intersection with a Major Thoroughfare on a horizontal curve having a centerline radius of less than 550 feet shall also provide the 30 foot tangent section. The tangent length shall be measured along the centerline of the street, from the right-of-way line of the intersecting street, extended, to the point of tangency with the centerline of the curve section. 
B.  New Major Thoroughfares shall provide tangent sections at intersections with streets in equal or higher categories as needed to provide adequate stopping distances at their design speeds. 
900-50.4   Intersection Approaches: Vertical Alignment. 
A.  For intersections with local or minor collector streets, a leveling of the street at a grade not exceeding 2 percent shall be provided but no level approach distance is required for streets approaching at less than 7 percent, and a minimum 25 foot level approach distance shall be provided for streets approaching at a grade of 7 percent or more. 
B.  As a street approaches an intersection with a major thoroughfare, there shall be a suitable leveling of the street at a grade not exceeding two percent and for a distance not less than the following minimums, as set forth in Table 900.4 below:

900-50.6   Islands. Islands in street intersections shall conform to the design requirements of the Standard Drawings in the Appendix of the UDO. In no case shall anything in an island extend more than three feet above the street grade within the right-of-way, except traffic regulatory devices and other infrastructure erected or approved by Gwinnett County. No island shall be approved which contains less than 100 square feet. 
900-50.7   Intersection Corner Sight Distance. 
A.  Intersections shall be designed with adequate corner sight distance for each street which approaches a street in an equal or higher street category (except an intersection of two local streets). Where necessary, backslopes shall be flattened and horizontal or vertical curves lengthened to provide the minimum required sight distance. 
B.  The minimum corner sight distance shall meet the standards as shown in Table 900.2 Sight Distance. 
C.  The sight distance criteria are based on the time required for a vehicle to make a left turn from a stop controlled approach to the Highway (AASHTO Case B1). The time to execute the maneuver is based on recommendations contained in NCHRP Report 383, Intersection Sight Distance. The sight distances, for a two-lane road, are the distances traveled at the arterial speed during 7.5 seconds. The time is increased by 0.5 seconds for each additional lane to be crossed. The sight distances given in Table 900.2 are for undivided highways. If the highway is divided, the effect of the median should be considered in determining the required sight distance. Based on the conditions, it may be feasible for the crossing maneuver to be done in two stages with a stop in the median. However, the intersection should only be treated in this manner if the signing and marking is accordingly provided. Otherwise, the sight distance requirements should be increased to account for the additional width that must be crossed. See AASHTO Green Book, Chapter 9 Intersections, for adjustments due to grades greater than 3 percent and design vehicles other than passenger cars. 
900-50.8   Obstructing Visibility at Intersections. In all zoning districts, no fence, wall, structure, shrubbery, or other obstruction to vision between the heights of 3 feet and 15 feet, except utility poles, light or street sign standards or tree trunks shall be permitted within 20 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way lines of streets, roads, highways or railroads. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2015-00001(GCID No. 2015-0360), 4-28-15) 
900-50.9   Turning Lanes at Intersections. Right turning lanes may be required to meet traffic demands or safety concerns. When provided, turning lanes shall meet the following criteria: 
A.  Storage length — A minimum of 150 feet of storage length for turning lanes on any arterial roadway shall be used. A minimum of 100 feet of storage length for turning lanes on all collectors shall be used. 
B.  Taper Length — The minimum taper length shall be 50 feet. 
C.  Left turning lanes from arterial roads shall be subject to longer storage lengths and tapers and as determined on a case by case basis. 
Section 900-60.   Street Design Standards.
900-60.1   Street Grades and Design Speeds. 
A.  Minimum grade for all Local and Minor Collector Streets shall be 1.5 percent. Minimum grades for all major collector and arterial streets shall conform to Georgia Department of Transportation standards and regulations. 
B.  Minimum grade of less than 1.5 percent on a local street may be approved by the Department, based on adequate engineering designs, where at least 1.5 percent cannot reasonably be achieved due to topographical limitations imposed by the land. In such cases, a Record Drawing and such computations as necessary shall be provided after construction to establish that the street will drain in accordance with this UDO. Street sections where unacceptable pooling, excessive spread at catch basins, or other hazardous conditions occur shall be reconstructed or otherwise improved to eliminate such conditions. 
C.  Minimum vehicle design speeds and maximum grades allowable in Gwinnett County by street classification shall be as shown in Table 900.6. 
D.  Maximum grade on any cul-de-sac turnaround shall be 6 percent. 
Table 900.6. Minimum Design Speeds and Maximum Grades. 

 
* Grades between 11 percent and 15 percent shall not exceed a length of 150 feet and shall require an "as graded" survey prior to the installation of the curb or utilities. The distance shall be measured as the tangent length between points of curvature. 
900-60.2   Vertical Street Alignment. 
A.  All changes in street profile grades having algebraic difference greater than one percent shall be connected by a parabolic curve having a minimum length (L) equal to the product of the algebraic difference between the grades in percent (A) and the design constant (K) assigned to the street according to its category (i.e., L=KA). 
B.  Constant (K) values are shown in the Table 900.7 for both desirable and minimum acceptable ("hardship") conditions. In all cases, the "desirable" value shall be used, unless it cannot be achieved due to topographic conditions beyond the developer's control. In such hardship situations, the Department may approve a lesser value to the extent required by the hardship situation, but in no event less than the value shown in Table 900.7 as "minimum." 
Table 900.7. Constant (K) Values for Vertical Curves. 

 
900-60.3   Horizontal Street Alignment. 
A.  All new streets shall adhere to the standards governing horizontal curvature and superelevation as set forth in Table 900.8 below:

B.  Superelevation for horizontal curves shall be calculated utilizing the following formula: 
R = minimum radius curve 
v = vehicle design speed (MPH) 
e = rate of superelevation (decimal of a foot rise per foot roadway) 
f = side friction factor 
R = v2 / 15 (e + f) 
Vehicle Design Speed (v)  30  40  50  60 
Side Friction Factor (f)   .16  .15  .14  .12 
C.  Widening section along existing streets shall be designed reflecting existing curvature and superelevation, if any, unless the existing street has been included in a specific design by the Gwinnett County Department of Transportation or Georgia Department of Transportation which calls for different standards, in which case the project will be coordinated with the overall design. 
D.  Superelevation runoff. Roadway edge curves shall be provided for tangent runout (bringing edge from a normal crown to centerline elevation) and superelevation runoff (from the end of tangent runout to the point of design superelevation) in accordance with design standards of the Georgia Department of Transportation or other professional engineering standards. 
E.  Tangents and compound curves. Between reverse horizontal curves there shall be not less than the minimum centerline tangents shown in Table 900.9 unless otherwise specified by the Georgia Department of Transportation. Compound radii curves are prohibited. At least the "desirable" length shall be provided unless hardship conditions of topography or property configuration will not allow lengths greater than those shown as "minimum." For compound circular curves, the ratio of the flatter radius to the sharper radius shall not exceed 1.5 to 1. 
Table 900.9. Tangents. 

 
Note: Minimum tangents are based on the distance traveled in 1.7 seconds at the design speed for each category of street. Desirable length is based on distance traveled in 2.0 seconds 
900-60.4   Horizontal and Vertical Clearances. 
A.  Horizontal clearances. 
1.  A shoulder of no less than 11 feet from the back of curb or edge of pavement, appropriately graded and having gentle slopes of not more than 0.5 inch per foot and rounded cross-sectional design shall be maintained along all streets.

Section 900-50. - Street Intersections. 
900-50.1   Angle of Intersection. Intersections shall generally be at right angles and shall not be at an angle of less than 85 degrees, unless approved by the Department, nor less than 80 degrees unless the intersection is signalized, in which case the angle of the intersection may be reduced subject to the review and approval of the Gwinnett County Department of Transportation. 
900-50.2   Maximum Grade. Street intersections should be designed with a flat grade wherever possible, but in no case should the grade exceed 2 percent in normal situations (or 4 percent in topographical hardship situations on local streets). 
900-50.3   Intersection Approaches: Horizontal Alignment. 
A.  New local streets which approach an intersection with a street in a category higher than itself on a horizontal curve having a centerline radius less than 240 feet shall provide a tangent section of roadway at least 30 feet long. Minor Collectors approaching an intersection with a Major Thoroughfare on a horizontal curve having a centerline radius of less than 550 feet shall also provide the 30 foot tangent section. The tangent length shall be measured along the centerline of the street, from the right-of-way line of the intersecting street, extended, to the point of tangency with the centerline of the curve section. 
B.  New Major Thoroughfares shall provide tangent sections at intersections with streets in equal or higher categories as needed to provide adequate stopping distances at their design speeds. 
900-50.4   Intersection Approaches: Vertical Alignment. 
A.  For intersections with local or minor collector streets, a leveling of the street at a grade not exceeding 2 percent shall be provided but no level approach distance is required for streets approaching at less than 7 percent, and a minimum 25 foot level approach distance shall be provided for streets approaching at a grade of 7 percent or more. 
B.  As a street approaches an intersection with a major thoroughfare, there shall be a suitable leveling of the street at a grade not exceeding two percent and for a distance not less than the following minimums, as set forth in Table 900.4 below: 
Table 900.4. Approach Distances at Major Intersections. 

 
* Distance of the approach is measured from edge of pavement of the intersecting street to the point of curvature in the approaching street. 
900-50.5   Intersection Radii. Intersection radii for roadways measured at back of curb and for the right-of-way lines shall be as set forth in Table 900.5 below. For intersecting streets of different classifications, the larger radii shall be provided. In all cases, adequate right-of-way shall be provided to maintain minimum of 11 feet from back-of-curb. Larger radii may be required for streets intersecting at angles less than 90 degrees. 
Table 900.5. Intersection Radii. 

 
* Intersecting right-of-way lines may be joined by an arc having the minimum radius shown, or by a miter which cuts across the right-of-way lines connecting the points where the required radius would have otherwise been tangent. 
900-50.6   Islands. Islands in street intersections shall conform to the design requirements of the Standard Drawings in the Appendix of the UDO. In no case shall anything in an island extend more than three feet above the street grade within the right-of-way, except traffic regulatory devices and other infrastructure erected or approved by Gwinnett County. No island shall be approved which contains less than 100 square feet. 
900-50.7   Intersection Corner Sight Distance. 
A.  Intersections shall be designed with adequate corner sight distance for each street which approaches a street in an equal or higher street category (except an intersection of two local streets). Where necessary, backslopes shall be flattened and horizontal or vertical curves lengthened to provide the minimum required sight distance. 
B.  The minimum corner sight distance shall meet the standards as shown in Table 900.2 Sight Distance. 
C.  The sight distance criteria are based on the time required for a vehicle to make a left turn from a stop controlled approach to the Highway (AASHTO Case B1). The time to execute the maneuver is based on recommendations contained in NCHRP Report 383, Intersection Sight Distance. The sight distances, for a two-lane road, are the distances traveled at the arterial speed during 7.5 seconds. The time is increased by 0.5 seconds for each additional lane to be crossed. The sight distances given in Table 900.2 are for undivided highways. If the highway is divided, the effect of the median should be considered in determining the required sight distance. Based on the conditions, it may be feasible for the crossing maneuver to be done in two stages with a stop in the median. However, the intersection should only be treated in this manner if the signing and marking is accordingly provided. Otherwise, the sight distance requirements should be increased to account for the additional width that must be crossed. See AASHTO Green Book, Chapter 9 Intersections, for adjustments due to grades greater than 3 percent and design vehicles other than passenger cars. 
900-50.8   Obstructing Visibility at Intersections. In all zoning districts, no fence, wall, structure, shrubbery, or other obstruction to vision between the heights of 3 feet and 15 feet, except utility poles, light or street sign standards or tree trunks shall be permitted within 20 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way lines of streets, roads, highways or railroads. 
(Ord. No. UDOA2015-00001(GCID No. 2015-0360), 4-28-15) 
900-50.9   Turning Lanes at Intersections. Right turning lanes may be required to meet traffic demands or safety concerns. When provided, turning lanes shall meet the following criteria: 
A.  Storage length — A minimum of 150 feet of storage length for turning lanes on any arterial roadway shall be used. A minimum of 100 feet of storage length for turning lanes on all collectors shall be used. 
B.  Taper Length — The minimum taper length shall be 50 feet. 
C.  Left turning lanes from arterial roads shall be subject to longer storage lengths and tapers and as determined on a case by case basis. 
Section 900-60.   Street Design Standards.
900-60.1   Street Grades and Design Speeds. 
A.  Minimum grade for all Local and Minor Collector Streets shall be 1.5 percent. Minimum grades for all major collector and arterial streets shall conform to Georgia Department of Transportation standards and regulations. 
B.  Minimum grade of less than 1.5 percent on a local street may be approved by the Department, based on adequate engineering designs, where at least 1.5 percent cannot reasonably be achieved due to topographical limitations imposed by the land. In such cases, a Record Drawing and such computations as necessary shall be provided after construction to establish that the street will drain in accordance with this UDO. Street sections where unacceptable pooling, excessive spread at catch basins, or other hazardous conditions occur shall be reconstructed or otherwise improved to eliminate such conditions. 
C.  Minimum vehicle design speeds and maximum grades allowable in Gwinnett County by street classification shall be as shown in Table 900.6. 
D.  Maximum grade on any cul-de-sac turnaround shall be 6 percent. 
Table 900.6. Minimum Design Speeds and Maximum Grades. 

 
* Grades between 11 percent and 15 percent shall not exceed a length of 150 feet and shall require an "as graded" survey prior to the installation of the curb or utilities. The distance shall be measured as the tangent length between points of curvature. 
900-60.2   Vertical Street Alignment. 
A.  All changes in street profile grades having algebraic difference greater than one percent shall be connected by a parabolic curve having a minimum length (L) equal to the product of the algebraic difference between the grades in percent (A) and the design constant (K) assigned to the street according to its category (i.e., L=KA). 
B.  Constant (K) values are shown in the Table 900.7 for both desirable and minimum acceptable ("hardship") conditions. In all cases, the "desirable" value shall be used, unless it cannot be achieved due to topographic conditions beyond the developer's control. In such hardship situations, the Department may approve a lesser value to the extent required by the hardship situation, but in no event less than the value shown in Table 900.7 as "minimum." 
Table 900.7. Constant (K) Values for Vertical Curves. 

 
900-60.3   Horizontal Street Alignment. 
A.  All new streets shall adhere to the standards governing horizontal curvature and superelevation as set forth in Table 900.8 below: 
Table 900.8. Horizontal Curves. 

 
* No superelevation will be allowed on Minor Collectors internal to residential subdivisions 
B.  Superelevation for horizontal curves shall be calculated utilizing the following formula: 
R = minimum radius curve 
v = vehicle design speed (MPH) 
e = rate of superelevation (decimal of a foot rise per foot roadway) 
f = side friction factor 
R = v2 / 15 (e + f) 
Vehicle Design Speed (v)  30  40  50  60 
Side Friction Factor (f)   .16  .15  .14  .12 
C.  Widening section along existing streets shall be designed reflecting existing curvature and superelevation, if any, unless the existing street has been included in a specific design by the Gwinnett County Department of Transportation or Georgia Department of Transportation which calls for different standards, in which case the project will be coordinated with the overall design. 
D.  Superelevation runoff. Roadway edge curves shall be provided for tangent runout (bringing edge from a normal crown to centerline elevation) and superelevation runoff (from the end of tangent runout to the point of design superelevation) in accordance with design standards of the Georgia Department of Transportation or other professional engineering standards. 
E.  Tangents and compound curves. Between reverse horizontal curves there shall be not less than the minimum centerline tangents shown in Table 900.9 unless otherwise specified by the Georgia Department of Transportation. Compound radii curves are prohibited. At least the "desirable" length shall be provided unless hardship conditions of topography or property configuration will not allow lengths greater than those shown as "minimum." For compound circular curves, the ratio of the flatter radius to the sharper radius shall not exceed 1.5 to 1. 
Table 900.9. Tangents. 

 
Note: Minimum tangents are based on the distance traveled in 1.7 seconds at the design speed for each category of street. Desirable length is based on distance traveled in 2.0 seconds 
900-60.4   Horizontal and Vertical Clearances. 
A.  Horizontal clearances. 
1.  A shoulder of no less than 11 feet from the back of curb or edge of pavement, appropriately graded and having gentle slopes of not more than 0.5 inch per foot and rounded cross-sectional design shall be maintained along all streets. Beyond the shoulder but within the right-of-way, slopes shall not exceed 1 foot of rise for each 2 feet of horizontal distance on a cut slope, and 1 foot of fall for each 3 feet of horizontal distance on a fill slope. 
2.  Along all public streets, a clear zone shall be provided per current AASHTO standards wherein nothing may be located above ground level except traffic/street signs, public utility structures, driveways, and mail boxes. 
3.  At selected locations, such as the outside of a sharp curve a wider clear zone with greater horizontal clearances provided to any roadside obstruction may be required. 
4.  The Department of Transportation, in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 32-6-51, is authorized to remove or direct the removal of any sign, signal, device, or other structure erected, placed, or maintained on the right-of-way of a public road which because of its nature, construction, or operation constitutes a danger to or interferes with the vision of drivers of motor vehicles. 
B.  Vertical clearances. Vertical clearance at underpasses shall be at least 14.5 feet over the entire roadway width. 
Section 900-70.   Street Construction Standards and Specifications.
900-70.1   Specifications. Unless otherwise specifically set forth herein, all of the materials, methods of construction, and workmanship for the work covered in reference to street construction shall conform to the latest specifications of the Georgia Department of Transportation. 
900-70.2   Subgrade Preparation for All Streets. 
A.  Subgrade preparation shall be in accordance with Georgia Department of Transportation specifications. 
B.  Removal of unsuitable material. If any sections of the subgrade are composed of topsoil, organic, or other unsuitable or unstable material, such material shall be removed and replaced with suitable material and then thoroughly compacted as specified for fill or stabilized. 
C.  Compaction. Fill shall be placed in uniform, horizontal layers not more than 8 inch thick (loose measurement). Moisture content shall be adjusted as necessary to compact material to 95 percent of maximum dry density except for the top 12 inches which shall be compacted to 100 percent of maximum dry density. 
D.  Brought to line and grade. After the earthwork has been completed, all storm drainage, water, and sanitary sewer utilities have been installed within the right-of-way as appropriate, and the backfill in all such ditches thoroughly compacted, the subgrade shall be brought to the lines, grades, and typical roadway section shown on the plans. 
E.  Utility trenches to be compacted. All utility crossings within the right-of-way must be installed prior to subgrade approval. All manhole covers must be flush with top of intermediate course if there is a delay in applying the final surface course for new roadway pavement.

A.  Minimum grade for all Local and Minor Collector Streets shall be 1.5 percent. Minimum grades for all major collector and arterial streets shall conform to Georgia Department of Transportation standards and regulations. 
B.  Minimum grade of less than 1.5 percent on a local street may be approved by the Department, based on adequate engineering designs, where at least 1.5 percent cannot reasonably be achieved due to topographical limitations imposed by the land. In such cases, a Record Drawing and such computations as necessary shall be provided after construction to establish that the street will drain in accordance with this UDO. Street sections where unacceptable pooling, excessive spread at catch basins, or other hazardous conditions occur shall be reconstructed or otherwise improved to eliminate such conditions. 
C.  Minimum vehicle design speeds and maximum grades allowable in Gwinnett County by street classification shall be as shown in Table 900.6. 
D.  Maximum grade on any cul-de-sac turnaround shall be 6 percent. 
Table 900.6. Minimum Design Speeds and Maximum Grades. 

 
* Grades between 11 percent and 15 percent shall not exceed a length of 150 feet and shall require an "as graded" survey prior to the installation of the curb or utilities. The distance shall be measured as the tangent length between points of curvature. 
900-60.2   Vertical Street Alignment. 
A.  All changes in street profile grades having algebraic difference greater than one percent shall be connected by a parabolic curve having a minimum length (L) equal to the product of the algebraic difference between the grades in percent (A) and the design constant (K) assigned to the street according to its category (i.e., L=KA). 
B.  Constant (K) values are shown in the Table 900.7 for both desirable and minimum acceptable ("hardship") conditions. In all cases, the "desirable" value shall be used, unless it cannot be achieved due to topographic conditions beyond the developer's control. In such hardship situations, the Department may approve a lesser value to the extent required by the hardship situation, but in no event less than the value shown in Table 900.7 as "minimum." 
Table 900.7. Constant (K) Values for Vertical Curves. 

 
900-60.3   Horizontal Street Alignment. 
A.  All new streets shall adhere to the standards governing horizontal curvature and superelevation as set forth in Table 900.8 below: 
Table 900.8. Horizontal Curves. 

 
* No superelevation will be allowed on Minor Collectors internal to residential subdivisions 
B.  Superelevation for horizontal curves shall be calculated utilizing the following formula: 
R = minimum radius curve 
v = vehicle design speed (MPH) 
e = rate of superelevation (decimal of a foot rise per foot roadway) 
f = side friction factor 
R = v2 / 15 (e + f) 
Vehicle Design Speed (v)  30  40  50  60 
Side Friction Factor (f)   .16  .15  .14  .12 
C.  Widening section along existing streets shall be designed reflecting existing curvature and superelevation, if any, unless the existing street has been included in a specific design by the Gwinnett County Department of Transportation or Georgia Department of Transportation which calls for different standards, in which case the project will be coordinated with the overall design. 
D.  Superelevation runoff. Roadway edge curves shall be provided for tangent runout (bringing edge from a normal crown to centerline elevation) and superelevation runoff (from the end of tangent runout to the point of design superelevation) in accordance with design standards of the Georgia Department of Transportation or other professional engineering standards. 
E.  Tangents and compound curves. Between reverse horizontal curves there shall be not less than the minimum centerline tangents shown in Table 900.9 unless otherwise specified by the Georgia Department of Transportation. Compound radii curves are prohibited. At least the "desirable" length shall be provided unless hardship conditions of topography or property configuration will not allow lengths greater than those shown as "minimum." For compound circular curves, the ratio of the flatter radius to the sharper radius shall not exceed 1.5 to 1. 
Table 900.9. Tangents. 

 
Note: Minimum tangents are based on the distance traveled in 1.7 seconds at the design speed for each category of street. Desirable length is based on distance traveled in 2.0 seconds 
900-60.4   Horizontal and Vertical Clearances.

Section 5-20. - Modified Single-Family Development 
5-20.1   Purpose. The purpose of Modified single-family development is to permit a procedure for development which will result in improved living and working environments; which will promote more economic subdivision layout; which will encourage ingenuity and originality in total subdivision and individual site design; and which can preserve open space to serve recreational, scenic, and public service purposes, and other purposes related thereto. To achieve these goals: 
A.  Permitting variations in lot areas. 
B.  Establishing procedures to assure adequate maintenance and restricted use of open space areas for the benefit of the inhabitants of the subdivisions. 
C.  Establishing procedures to assure adequate protection of existing and potential developments adjoining the proposed Modified development. 
5-20.2   Special Use Permit Required. A Modified single-family development may be permitted in an R-100 or R-75 district provided the applicant for such a development is granted a Special Use Permit by the Board of Commissioners after receiving recommendations from the Director of Planning and Development and the Planning Commission and after a public hearing. The Board of Commissioners may reduce the individual lot size that would otherwise be required, up to 30 percent in an R-100 district and up to 25 percent in an R 75 district. Maximum density shall not exceed 2.3 units per acre for the R-100 Modified zoning designation and 3.0 units per acre for the R-75 Modified zoning designation. 
5-20.3   Minimum Size of a Modified Development. Modified developments shall consist of at least 16 dwelling units, except that Modified developments that are found by the Board of Commissioners to be a logical extension of an existing or approved Modified development may contain fewer dwelling units. 
5-20.4   Subdivision Approval Required. No Modified development may be constructed except in accordance with the provisions of Section 5-20. 
5-20.5   Modification of Yard and Lot Requirements. Modification and variation of yard and lot requirements may be permitted subject to the following minimum standards listed below in Section 5-20.6. 
5-20.6  The following table indicates the minimum setbacks, lot width and height requirements for Modified developments:

A.  In each district allowing Modified development, the lot size may be reduced from the general lot size for that district to a specified minimum lot size for Modified development, in accordance with the percentage reduction limits and Section 5-20.6 Minimum Yard and Height Requirements For Modified Development. All such lot reductions shall be compensated for by an equivalent amount of land in open space to be preserved and maintained for its scenic values, recreation or conservation purposes. Up to one-half of such open space may be located in a 100-year floodplain or an existing lake, and up to 100 percent may be located within a permanent proposed lake which does not function solely as a detention facility or within delineated wetlands. 
B.  Open space shall not include areas devoted to public or private vehicular streets or any land which has been, or is to be, conveyed to a public agency, via a purchase agreement for such uses as parks, schools, or other public facilities, or which lies within any required recreation area, overhead power easement, or stormwater detention facility. 
C.  If open space is not dedicated to public use, it shall be protected by legal arrangements, satisfactory to the Board of Commissioners, sufficient to assure its maintenance and preservation for whatever purpose it is intended. Covenants or other legal arrangements shall specify ownership of the open space; method of maintenance; responsibility for maintenance; maintenance taxes and insurance; compulsory membership and compulsory assessment provisions; guarantees that any association formed to own and maintain open space will not be dissolved without the consent of the Board of Commissioners; and any other specifications deemed necessary by the Board of Commissioners. 
5-20.8   Criteria for Modified Development Concept Plan Review.

Section 5-60.   R-ZT Single Family Residence Zero Lot Line/Townhouse District.
(Prior to January 2005). 
This district is intended to provide areas for the development of moderate density residential uses and structures in moderately spacious surroundings. It is intended that these districts be located in the urban and suburban portions of Gwinnett County where a protected environment suitable for moderate-density residential use can be provided, as well as in established moderate-density residential areas as a means to ensure their continuance. The use of this district is also appropriate on a smaller scale in the suburban portions of the County as a transitional zone between low-density residential districts and commercial districts, industrial districts, or major transportation arteries, or other uses that are not compatible with a low-density residential environment. In fulfilling the intent of this district, the townhouse concept may be used which permits the construction of single-family dwellings immediately adjacent to one another without side yards between the individual units and which units may or may not be structurally connected. The intent of this district may also be fulfilled by the use of the Zero Lot Line concept, which permits the construction of detached single-family dwellings on lots without a side yard requirement on one side of the lot. This concept permits better use of the entire lot by compacting the usual front, rear and side yards into one or more internal gardens which may be completely walled in or screened. 
5-60.1  Within the R-ZT Single Family Residence Zero Lot Line/Townhouse District, the following uses are permitted: 
A.  Zero Lot Line Single Family Detached Dwellings.

A.  Maximum density shall not exceed 8 units per acre for attached dwelling units and 6 units per acre for detached dwelling units. 
B.  Minimum lot width for Zero Lot Line or single family detached units - 40 feet. Minimum lot width for townhouse attached units - 22 feet. Zero Lot Line or single family detached lots shall maintain a minimum road frontage of 20 feet. Townhouse lots shall maintain a minimum road frontage of 15 feet. 
C.  Minimum front yard depth shall be 20 feet. 
D.  Minimum side yard depth - None for townhouses except that on corner lots the minimum side yard of the corner side shall be 20 feet. Zero lot line lots shall have a 0 foot side yard on one side and a minimum of 10 feet on the opposite side. Single family detached units shall have a minimum 5 foot side yard on each side. 
E.  Minimum rear yard depth - When abutting an R-75 or R-100 district, the rear yard shall be equal to the required buffer plus an additional 5 feet. However, the rear yard setback shall not be less than 25 feet. 
F.  Maximum height - 35 feet or two and one-half stories. 
G.  Provide two or more off-street parking spaces per dwelling unit. 
H.  Provide sidewalks adjacent to interior streets, excluding cul-de-sac turnarounds.

K.  A maximum of eight dwelling units shall be allowed in each row of townhouses. When an end unit of a townhouse row does not side on a street, an open space or court of at least 20 feet in width shall be provided between it and the adjacent row of townhouses, and this open space shall be divided between the two immediately adjacent townhouse lots as to property or lot lines. 
L.  Where townhouse lots and dwelling units are designed to face upon an open or common access court rather than upon a street, this open court shall be a minimum of 40 feet in width and said court shall not include vehicular drives or parking areas. 
M.  Townhouses shall be constructed up to side lot lines without side yards, and no windows, doors, or other opening shall face a side lot line except that that the outside wall of end units may contain such openings. 
N.  Zero Lot Line dwellings shall be constructed against the lot line on one side of a lot, and no windows, doors, or other openings shall be permitted on this side. The access for exterior maintenance shall be assured through a perpetual wall maintenance easement of 5 feet in width as necessary 
O.  A minimum of a two-hour rated firewall shall be required between each attached dwelling unit. A four-hour rated fire-wall shall be required between every fourth attached dwelling unit. Firewalls shall be constructed in accordance with applicable building codes of Gwinnett County 
5-60.3   All R-ZT Amendments to be Conditional Zoning Amendments. All R-ZT Single Family Residence Zero Lot Line/Townhouse amendments to the Official Zoning Map shall be conditional amendments. In addition to any other conditions that may be imposed by the Board of Commissioners pursuant to the provisions for conditional zoning in this Unified Development Ordinance, a concept plan showing the approximate location of all buildings, walls, fences, property lines, landscaping, parking areas and uses and any other features deemed appropriate by the Board of Commissioners as a result of the above concept plan review and public hearing, shall be included as part of the amendment, and the use of the property for its zoned purposes shall be conditioned on said concept plan.

Section 5-190.   Big Haynes Creek Conservation Subdivision Option.
Development proposals for the Big Haynes Creek Conservation Subdivision Option will no longer be accepted. The following regulations listed below are retained for instruction with regard to existing Conservation Subdivisions. 
5-190.1   Purpose. The purpose of the Big Hayes Creek Conservation Subdivision Option is to provide for residential development within the Big Haynes Creek Drainage Basin which will promote more economic subdivision development, provide a mechanism for the preservation of water quality within the watershed through the dedication of open space areas, and achieve other water quality preservation purposes related thereto. To achieve these goals: 
A.  Variations in lot area, width and setback are permitted. 
B.  Open space areas shall be established for the preservation of water quality and the benefit of subdivision residents. 
5-190.2   Permitted Uses. The provisions of this Section shall apply to all land of unincorporated Gwinnett County located within the Big Haynes Creek Watershed and zoned R-100 or R-75. Single-family residential subdivision lots may be altered as provide herein. Except as provided in this Section, all other standards of the R-100 or R-75 zoning district shall be observed. 
5-190.3   Design Requirements. Within the Big Haynes Creek Watershed, R-100 and R-75 subdivisions may comply with criteria for provision or participation in wet detention facilities established by the Big Haynes Creek Watershed Protection Agreement; or, 
A.  Comply with the following subdivision design requirements: 
1.  The subdivision development shall contain a minimum land area of 5 contiguous acres. 
2.  Set aside a minimum of 60 percent of the gross land area of the development as permanent, undisturbed open space. Concurrent with the recording of the final subdivision plat, the subdivider shall execute and record a deed which restricts the use of the set aside as permanent natural undisturbed open space. Required open space shall be deeded with the first phase of development to a mandatory property owner's association. 
3.  Maximum net density shall not exceed 3 units per acre for detached dwelling units. 
4.  Provide a minimum lot width of 65 feet, and a minimum lot area of 7,800 square feet. 
5.  Front yards shall have a minimum depth of 20 feet. 
6.  Rear yards shall have a minimum depth of 20 feet. 
Section 5-200.   Chattahoochee River Tributary Protection: Stream Buffer Zones Required.
This section of the Unified Development Ordinance is adopted pursuant to the requirements of Georgia Code Section 12-5-453. Stream buffer zones for the Chattahoochee River Corridor are described in Section 500-10.5.B of this Unified Development Ordinance. 
5-200.1   Findings and Purposes. The Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners finds that: 
A.  The Chattahoochee River provides multiple benefits, which include use of the river as the primary water supply for metropolitan Atlanta. 
B.  The water quality of the Chattahoochee River depends upon the water quality of the flowing streams tributary to the river. 
C.  Sediment and other polluting materials and conditions, including but not limited to pesticides, nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, toxic materials, and elevations in water temperatures, are harmful to the water quality of the river and its tributaries. 
D.  The riparian vegetation along these watercourses helps preserve water quality. Dense tree growth helps to prevent stream bank erosion and streamside vegetation reduces the amount of sediment and other polluting materials that would otherwise wash into streams. Riparian trees, by shading, help maintain cooler water temperatures and thus enhance water quality. 
5-200.2   Purposes are: 
A.  Promote health, safety and general welfare; to minimize public and private losses due to erosion siltation and water pollution. 
B.  Create vegetation buffer areas adjacent to tributary streams in the drainage basin of the Chattahoochee River. 
5-200.3   Stream Buffer Zone. This protection area means the stream channel and the land area extending outward 35 horizontal feet from the banks on either side of all flowing streams in the drainage basins of all tributaries of the Chattahoochee River located in unincorporated Gwinnett County. A flowing stream is defined for the purpose of this section as any stream that is portrayed on the most current United States Geological Survey 7.5 minute quadrangle as a perennial stream 15 feet adjacent to the stream bank of said area will be left as a natural buffer and 35-foot minimum will be left as an accessory building setback. (This is not a change in the minimum rear yard setback nor permission to build in the floodplain.) Stream buffer zone (i.e., 15 feet from bank) must be shown on final subdivision plats, commercial and industrial site plans and multi-family residential site plans. 
5-200.4 
A.  Permit Required. 
1.  No person shall engage in any land disturbing activity within the area without having obtained a subdivision development permit, site development permit, or building permit from the Development Division. 
2.  No permit will be issued for any land disturbing activity within the protection area unless the land disturbing activity is for the purpose of constructing one of the following: 
a.  A stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route, or a public utility including sanitary sewer lines. 
b.  The construction of public utilities including sanitary sewer lines. 
c.  A dam and/or impoundment, a detention, retention, or sediment control pond or facility. 
B.  Exceptions. The provisions of this section shall not apply to: 
1.  Any public agency or its contractor. 
2.  Any person performing work within a right-of-way of any public agency pursuant to a permit issued by such public agency. 
3.  Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property provided a written factual report is presented to the Director of Planning and Development within 10 days. 
4.  Any development which has received a development permit prior to the adoption of this section. 
5.  Any work consisting of the operation, repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land existing on the date of adoption of this section.

Section 5-60. - R-ZT Single Family Residence Zero Lot Line/Townhouse District. 
(Prior to January 2005). 
This district is intended to provide areas for the development of moderate density residential uses and structures in moderately spacious surroundings. It is intended that these districts be located in the urban and suburban portions of Gwinnett County where a protected environment suitable for moderate-density residential use can be provided, as well as in established moderate-density residential areas as a means to ensure their continuance. The use of this district is also appropriate on a smaller scale in the suburban portions of the County as a transitional zone between low-density residential districts and commercial districts, industrial districts, or major transportation arteries, or other uses that are not compatible with a low-density residential environment. In fulfilling the intent of this district, the townhouse concept may be used which permits the construction of single-family dwellings immediately adjacent to one another without side yards between the individual units and which units may or may not be structurally connected. The intent of this district may also be fulfilled by the use of the Zero Lot Line concept, which permits the construction of detached single-family dwellings on lots without a side yard requirement on one side of the lot. This concept permits better use of the entire lot by compacting the usual front, rear and side yards into one or more internal gardens which may be completely walled in or screened. 
5-60.1  Within the R-ZT Single Family Residence Zero Lot Line/Townhouse District, the following uses are permitted:

Section 5-190. - Big Haynes Creek Conservation Subdivision Option. 
Development proposals for the Big Haynes Creek Conservation Subdivision Option will no longer be accepted. The following regulations listed below are retained for instruction with regard to existing Conservation Subdivisions. 
5-190.1   Purpose. The purpose of the Big Hayes Creek Conservation Subdivision Option is to provide for residential development within the Big Haynes Creek Drainage Basin which will promote more economic subdivision development, provide a mechanism for the preservation of water quality within the watershed through the dedication of open space areas, and achieve other water quality preservation purposes related thereto. To achieve these goals: 
A.  Variations in lot area, width and setback are permitted. 
B.  Open space areas shall be established for the preservation of water quality and the benefit of subdivision residents. 
5-190.2   Permitted Uses. The provisions of this Section shall apply to all land of unincorporated Gwinnett County located within the Big Haynes Creek Watershed and zoned R-100 or R-75. Single-family residential subdivision lots may be altered as provide herein. Except as provided in this Section, all other standards of the R-100 or R-75 zoning district shall be observed. 
5-190.3   Design Requirements. Within the Big Haynes Creek Watershed, R-100 and R-75 subdivisions may comply with criteria for provision or participation in wet detention facilities established by the Big Haynes Creek Watershed Protection Agreement; or, 
A.  Comply with the following subdivision design requirements: 
1.  The subdivision development shall contain a minimum land area of 5 contiguous acres. 
2.  Set aside a minimum of 60 percent of the gross land area of the development as permanent, undisturbed open space. Concurrent with the recording of the final subdivision plat, the subdivider shall execute and record a deed which restricts the use of the set aside as permanent natural undisturbed open space. Required open space shall be deeded with the first phase of development to a mandatory property owner's association. 
3.  Maximum net density shall not exceed 3 units per acre for detached dwelling units. 
4.  Provide a minimum lot width of 65 feet, and a minimum lot area of 7,800 square feet. 
5.  Front yards shall have a minimum depth of 20 feet. 
6.  Rear yards shall have a minimum depth of 20 feet. 
Section 5-200. - Chattahoochee River Tributary Protection: Stream Buffer Zones Required. 
This section of the Unified Development Ordinance is adopted pursuant to the requirements of Georgia Code Section 12-5-453. Stream buffer zones for the Chattahoochee River Corridor are described in Section 500-10.5.B of this Unified Development Ordinance. 
5-200.1   Findings and Purposes. The Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners finds that: 
A.  The Chattahoochee River provides multiple benefits, which include use of the river as the primary water supply for metropolitan Atlanta. 
B.  The water quality of the Chattahoochee River depends upon the water quality of the flowing streams tributary to the river. 
C.  Sediment and other polluting materials and conditions, including but not limited to pesticides, nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, toxic materials, and elevations in water temperatures, are harmful to the water quality of the river and its tributaries. 
D.  The riparian vegetation along these watercourses helps preserve water quality. Dense tree growth helps to prevent stream bank erosion and streamside vegetation reduces the amount of sediment and other polluting materials that would otherwise wash into streams. Riparian trees, by shading, help maintain cooler water temperatures and thus enhance water quality. 
5-200.2   Purposes are: 
A.  Promote health, safety and general welfare; to minimize public and private losses due to erosion siltation and water pollution. 
B.  Create vegetation buffer areas adjacent to tributary streams in the drainage basin of the Chattahoochee River. 
5-200.3   Stream Buffer Zone. This protection area means the stream channel and the land area extending outward 35 horizontal feet from the banks on either side of all flowing streams in the drainage basins of all tributaries of the Chattahoochee River located in unincorporated Gwinnett County. A flowing stream is defined for the purpose of this section as any stream that is portrayed on the most current United States Geological Survey 7.5 minute quadrangle as a perennial stream 15 feet adjacent to the stream bank of said area will be left as a natural buffer and 35-foot minimum will be left as an accessory building setback. (This is not a change in the minimum rear yard setback nor permission to build in the floodplain.) Stream buffer zone (i.e., 15 feet from bank) must be shown on final subdivision plats, commercial and industrial site plans and multi-family residential site plans. 
5-200.4 
A.  Permit Required. 
1.  No person shall engage in any land disturbing activity within the area without having obtained a subdivision development permit, site development permit, or building permit from the Development Division. 
2.  No permit will be issued for any land disturbing activity within the protection area unless the land disturbing activity is for the purpose of constructing one of the following: 
a.  A stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route, or a public utility including sanitary sewer lines. 
b.  The construction of public utilities including sanitary sewer lines. 
c.  A dam and/or impoundment, a detention, retention, or sediment control pond or facility. 
B.  Exceptions. The provisions of this section shall not apply to: 
1.  Any public agency or its contractor. 
2.  Any person performing work within a right-of-way of any public agency pursuant to a permit issued by such public agency. 
3.  Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property provided a written factual report is presented to the Director of Planning and Development within 10 days. 
4.  Any development which has received a development permit prior to the adoption of this section. 
5.  Any work consisting of the operation, repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land existing on the date of adoption of this section.
