PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete republication of the general and permanent ordinances the City of Brunswick, Georgia. This republication of the Code contains all ordinances deemed advisable to be included at this time through Ordinance No. 1011, adopted May 6, 2009. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the 1991 recodification of the Code were the 1953 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1953 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indices 
The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

PART I - CHARTER[1] 
ORDINANCE NO. 894 
AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND AND CODIFY PROVISIONS OF THE MUNICIPAL CHARTER OF THE CITY OF BRUNSWICK; TO CONTINUE IN EFFECT CURRENT PROVISIONS OF SAID CHARTER, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, AFFECTING THE COMPOSITION AND FORM OF THE MUNICIPAL GOVERNING AUTHORITY, THE PROCEDURE FOR ELECTION OF THE MEMBERS THEREOF, AND THE CONTINUANCE IN OFFICE AND LIMITATION THEREON FOR SUCH MEMBERS; TO AMEND SAID CHARTER SO AS TO PROVIDE FOR A CITY MANAGER AND OTHER OFFICERS, TO PROVIDE FOR BOUNDARIES AND POWERS OF THE CITY, AND TO PROVIDE FOR FISCAL MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION OF MUNICIPAL BUSINESS AND RELATED MATTERS; TO CONTINUE IN EFFECT THE PROVISIONS OF SAID CHARTER, AS AMENDED, PARTICULARLY AS AMENDED BY AN ACT APPROVED FEBRUARY 17, 1950, AUTHORIZING THE LEVY AND COLLECTION OF TAXES; TO REPEAL PROVISIONS OF SAID CHARTER WHICH HAVE BEEN SUPERSEDED BY GENERAL LAW, WHICH HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR WHICH ARE IN CONFLICT WITH THIS ORDINANCE; TO PROVIDE AN EFFECTIVE DATE; AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES. 
THE COMMISSION OF THE CITY OF BRUNSWICK HEREBY ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS: 
SECTION 1. It is the intent of this ordinance to continue in effect fundamental provisions of the municipal charter of the City of Brunswick concerning the governing authority and taxation, in conformity with Official Code of Georgia Annotated Sec. 36-35-6 [O.C.G.A. § 36-35-6], limiting the home rule powers of municipal corporations; to modernize the charter by amending it in other respects pursuant to the Municipal Home Rule Act of 1965, particularly Official Code of Georgia Annotated Sec. 36-35-3 [O.C.G.A. § 36-35-3]; to repeal charter provisions which have been superseded by general law, which have become obsolete or which are in conflict with this ordinance; and to codify the resulting charter. 
SECTION 2. Those fundamental provisions of the current charter which shall continue in effect are identified hereinafter by parenthetical references following such provisions. 
SECTION 3. Those provisions of the current charter which are not identified hereinafter as provisions which shall continue in effect are hereby stricken in their entirety, provided, however, that this repealer shall not operate to affect vested rights, title to real property, the closure of streets or the names of streets as heretofore designated by the commission. 
SECTION 4. Reference is hereby made to Section 2 of an Act approved August 11, 1920 (1920 Ga. Laws, pp. 757, 760) which provides: "The offices of Mayor and Aldermen and all other officers of said city created by legislative enactment, except as hereinafter provided for, are hereby abolished, and all laws creating such offices and defining the duties and authority pertaining thereto are hereby repealed, except as hereinafter provided for." The commission hereby finds that the foregoing effectively repealed that provision of an Act approved November 12, 1889 (1889 Ga. Laws, pp. 1010, 1015) subsequently codified as Section 15 of the charter as set forth in the Brunswick City Code, 1952. The 1889 provision, therefore, is not carried forward as a limitation of office in the charter as hereinafter set forth. 
SECTION 5. If any provision of this ordinance or of the charter as hereinafter set forth is held invalid or unconstitutional for any reason by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision, and such holding shall not affect the remaining provisions of the ordinance or charter. 
SECTION 6. This ordinance and the charter set forth hereinafter shall become effective on January 1, 1991. 
SECTION 7. As of said effective date the municipal charter of the City of Brunswick shall be as set forth in the pages appended hereto. 
Notice of intent published: September 15, 22, 29, 1990. 
Read and adopted first time: September 19, 1990.

In the event the office of a commissioner shall become vacant, either by recall or for any other reason, then his successor for the unexpired term shall be a resident of the ward represented at the time of the election of the commissioner creating the vacancy. The term "resident" shall be held to mean a bona fide and continuous residence for a period of six months immediately preceding any election herein referred to. However, in the event of the removal of the residence of a member of the commission from one ward to another, the same shall not create a vacancy. (Enacted by 1920 Ga.

ARTICLE VII. - EXISTING STRUCTURES 

Sec. 5-176. - Intent and purpose. 
(a)  The intent of this article is to provide guidelines for the uniform application of fire and building related codes to existing buildings and structures throughout the city; to define certain terms; to provide acceptable alternative safeguards to requirements of various fire and building code provisions where strict compliance is not practical; to specify various hazardous conditions in existing buildings and structures which should not be permitted to exist; to relieve building and fire code enforcement authorities from certain liabilities when applying the provisions of this article; to provide for rules and regulations; to provide construction and fire safety standards for landmark museum buildings and historic buildings; to exempt landmark museum buildings and historic buildings from certain laws and regulations; to provide for other matters relative thereto; to provide an effective date; to repeal conflicting laws; and for other purposes. 
(b)  It is a purpose of this article to encourage the sensitive rehabilitation, restoration, stabilization, or preservation of existing buildings throughout the city and to encourage the preservation of buildings and structures deemed to be historic in total or in part; provided, however, such rehabilitation and preservation efforts should provide for the upgrading of the safety features of the building or structure to provide a practical level of safety to the public and surrounding property. It is the further purpose of this article to provide guidance regarding acceptable alternative solutions and to stimulate enforcement authorities to utilize alternative compliance concepts wherever practical to permit the continued use of existing buildings and structures without overly restrictive financial burdens on owners or occupants. 
(c)  The provisions of this article shall not be applicable to new construction, except as specifically provided in this article. 
(Ord. No. 891, § I, 7-18-1990)

Sec. 5-181. - Additions. 
Additions to an existing building shall comply with the applicable requirements of state and local laws, rules, regulations, codes, and standards for new construction. Such additions shall not impose loads, either vertically or horizontally, which would cause the existing building to be subjected to stresses exceeding those permitted under new construction. If the existing building does not comply with the standards provided in this article and the authorized enforcement authority finds that the addition adversely affects the performance of the total building, the authorized enforcement authority may require: 
(1)  The new addition to be separated from the existing structure by at least a two-hour fire wall with openings therein properly protected; 
(2)  The installation of an approved automatic fire suppression system; or 
(3)  Other remedies which may be deemed appropriate by the enforcement authority. 
(Ord. No. 891, § VI, 7-18-1990) 
Sec. 5-182. - Minor alterations and new mechanical systems. 
Minor alterations or repairs to an existing building which do not adversely affect the performance or safety of the building may be made with the same or like materials. Existing buildings which, in part or as a whole, exceed the requirements of any applicable construction or fire safety code may, in the course of compliance with this article, have reduced or removed, in part or total, features not required by such code for new construction; provided, however, that such features were not a condition of prior approval. Existing buildings and structures which, in part or as a whole, do not meet the requirements of the applicable code for new construction may be altered or repaired without further compliance to any such code by utilizing the provisions of this article, provided their present degree of compliance to any applicable construction or fire safety code is not reduced. Any new mechanical systems installed in an existing building shall conform to applicable codes for new construction to the fullest extent practical as approved by the authorized enforcement authorities.

Sec. 5-184. - Change in use. 
(a)  A total change in the use or occupancy of an existing building which would cause a greater hazard to the public shall not be made unless such building is made to comply with the requirements of the applicable state and local rules, regulations, codes, and standards for the new use or occupancy; provided, however, the compliance alternative provisions of this article may be utilized by authorized enforcement authorities where total or strict compliance with applicable state or local rules, regulations, codes, or standards is not practical. 
(b)  When the proposed use is of equal or lesser hazard as determined by an authorized enforcement authority, further compliance with any code for new construction is not required unless otherwise provided in this article. Alterations or repairs to an existing building or structure which do not adversely affect the performance of the building may be made with like materials. Any proposed change to the existing building or change in type of contents of the existing building shall not increase the fire hazard to adjacent buildings or structures. If the fire hazard to adjacent buildings or structures is increased, then requirements of applicable construction or fire safety codes for exterior walls shall apply. 
(c)  Sprinkler systems shall be required in accordance with NFPA 13-D or NFPA 13-R standards in one-family, two-family, and multifamily residences, group dwellings and boardinghouses, as defined in the zoning ordinance.

Sec. 5-185. - Change in use of a portion of a building. 
(a)  If a portion of a building is changed to a new use or occupancy and that portion is separated from the remainder of the building with vertical or horizontal fire separations complying with applicable state or local rules, regulations, codes, or standards or with compliance alternatives, then the portion changed shall be made to comply to the applicable requirements for the new use or occupancy to the extent noted in section 5-184. 
(b)  If a portion of the building is changed to a new use or occupancy and that portion is not separated from the remainder of the building as noted in subsection (a) of this section, then the provisions of the applicable state and local rules, regulations, codes, and standards applying to each use or occupancy of the building shall apply to the entire building to the extent noted in section 5-184; provided, however, if there are conflicting provisions in requirements for the various uses or occupancies, the authorized enforcement authority shall apply the strictest requirements. 
(c)  Sprinkler systems shall be required in accordance with NFPA 13-D and NFPA 13-R standards in one-family, two-family, and multifamily residences, group dwellings or boardinghouses, as defined in the zoning ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 891, § X, 7-18-1990) 
Sec. 5-186. - Floor loading. 
Any proposed change in the use or occupancy of an existing building or portion thereof which could increase the floor loading should be investigated by a state registered professional engineer to determine the adequacy of the existing floor system to support the increased loads. If the existing floor system is found to be inadequate, it should be modified to support the increased loads or the proposed allowable floor loading shall be reduced by and posted by the appropriate enforcement authority. 
(Ord. No. 891, § XI, 7-18-1990) 
Sec. 5-187. - Documentation. 
Whenever action is taken on any existing building to repair, make alterations, or change the use or occupancy of an existing structure and, when such action proposes the use of compliance alternatives, the authorized enforcement authority shall ensure that at least one copy of the accepted compliance alternatives approved, including applicable plans, test data, or other data submitted for evaluation, be maintained on file in the office of the local enforcement authority. If the structure also falls under the jurisdiction of a state level enforcement authority, at least one copy of such material shall be maintained on file with that authority. 
(Ord. No. 891, § XII, 7-18-1990) 
Sec. 5-188. - Compliance alternatives. 
Subsections (1) through (5) of this section contain generally acceptable compliance alternatives illustrating principles which shall be applied to the rehabilitation of existing buildings by enforcement authorities in the city.

ARTICLE IX. - SMOKING IN CITY BUILDINGS[9] 

Footnotes: 
--- (9) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 956, adopted June 4, 2003, added new provisions to ch. 5 of the Code as art. II, §§ 5-21—5-35. As other provisions existed within the Code as art. II of ch. 5, the provisions of Ord. No. 956, §§ 5-21—5-35, have been redesignated as art. IX, §§ 5-251—5-265, at the editor's discretion. 

Sec. 5-251. - Title. 
This article shall be known as the city smoke-free air ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 956, § 5-21, 6-4-2003) 
Sec. 5-252. - Finding and intent. 
(a)  The city board of commissioners does hereby find that: 
(1)  Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute determined in 1999 (Monograph #10) that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of 65,000 Americans annually. 
(2)  The Public Health Service's National Toxicology Program has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen (U.S. DHHS, 2000, Citing Cal. EPA, 1997). 
(3)  Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities and cancer. 
(4)  The Americans With Disabilities Act, which requires that disabled persons have access to public places and workplaces, deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability. 
(5)  The U.S. Surgeon General has determined that the simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, the exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke. The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that secondhand smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels by high rates of ventilation. Air cleaners, which are only capable of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke, do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand smoke. 
(6)  A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled offices suffer a 25 to 50 percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function. 
(7)  Smoke-filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease, lower productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs, increased health insurance rates, and increased liability claims for disease related to exposure to secondhand smoke. 
(b)  Accordingly, the city board of commissioners finds and declares that the purposes of this article are: 
(1)  To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in all public facilities in the city; and 
(2)  To guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air, and to recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.

A copy of the operator's permit showing that the operator has been trained on the particular type of instrument used and one of the original copies of the test results or, where the test is performed by the Division of Forensic Sciences, a copy of the crime lab report shall satisfy the requirements of this subparagraph. 
(3)  The hearing officer shall, within five calendar days after such hearing, forward a decision to the department to rescind or sustain the suspension of the person's privilege to operate a vessel on the waters of this state. If no hearing is requested within the ten business days specified in subsection (1) of this subsection, and the failure to request such hearing is due in whole or in part to the reasonably avoidable fault of the person, the right to a hearing shall have been waived. The request for a hearing shall not stay the suspension of the person's privilege to operate a vessel on the waters of this state; provided, however, that if the hearing is timely requested and is not held within 60 days and the delay is not due in whole or in part to the reasonably avoidable fault of the person, the suspension shall be stayed until such time as the hearing is held and the hearing officer's decision is made. 
(4)  In the event the person is acquitted of a violation of section 8-6 or such charge is initially disposed of other than by a conviction or plea of nolo contendere, then the suspension shall be terminated. An accepted plea of nolo contendere shall be entered on the operator's record and shall be considered and counted as a conviction for purposes of any future violations of section 8-6.

"This breath-testing instrument (serial no. ____________ ) was thoroughly inspected, tested, and standardized by the undersigned on (date ;daterule;) and all of its electronic and operating components prescribed by its manufacturer are properly attached and are in good working order." 
When properly prepared and executed, as prescribed in this subsection, the certificate shall, notwithstanding any other provision of law, be self-authenticating, shall be admissible in any court of law, and shall satisfy the pertinent requirements of subsection (1) of subsection (c) of section 8-6 and subsection (g)(2)(C) of this Code section.

(1)  For buildings less than 10,000 square feet constructed mainly for storage of products with limited life loss potential some flexibility may be allowed provided that either the following requirements of subsection 10-2 are met: High hazard, hazardous area, Life safety evaluation and Special hazard. In the event of any changes made that contribute to the hazard and reclassification of any contents within the occupancy, the owner shall notify the fire marshal's office in writing of such changes. Where more than two sprinklers are installed in a single area for protection, water flow detection shall be provided to sound the building fire alarm or to notify by a signal, any constantly attended location, such as PBX, security, or emergency room, at which the necessary correction shall be taken. 
(2)  Building storing materials that are water reactive or may be more damaged by water fighting a fire than by a fire may be allowed a variance or allowed alternative methods of fire suppression upon petition to the fire marshal/fire inspector's office. 
(3)  Additions to existing unprotected buildings where the additions totals less than 50 percent of the area of the building may be granted exemption by the fire marshal/fire inspector's office; provided, however, the addition must be separated by fire rated construction in accordance with building codes in the Glynn-Brunswick Area and is not required to be protected by some other applicable code. 
(4)  Where the total area of all the reconstruction (the reconfiguration of a space that affects an exit or a corridor shared by more than a single tenant; or the reconfiguration of a space such that the rehabilitation work area is not permitted to be occupied because existing means of egress and fire protection systems, or their equivalent, are not in place or continuously maintained) included in a modification exceeds 50 percent of the area of the building; the work shall be considered as a reconstruction and shall comply with the requirements of the Life Safety Code NFPA 101 sections 43.6 for the applicable occupancy. On any one story with rehabilitation work areas involving over 50 percent of the area of the story, a sprinkler system shall be provided throughout the story in accordance with Life Safety Code NFPA 101 applicable to new construction for the occupancy.

(Ord. No. 983, § 1(11-1), 9-6-2006; Ord. No. 1052, § 1, 12-20-2017) 
Sec. 11-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of Brunswick, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 983, § 1(11-2), 9-6-2006; Ord. No. 1052, § 1, 12-20-2017) 
Sec. 11-3. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(a)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(b)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(c)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and 
(d)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(e)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(Ord. No. 983, § 1(11-3), 9-6-2006; Ord. No. 1052, § 1, 12-20-2017) 
Sec. 11-4. - Objectives. 
The objectives of this chapter are: 
(a)  To protect human life and health; 
(b)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(c)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(d)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(e)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(f)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions, and; 
(g)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

The effects of wave hazards between the VE zone and the LiMWA (or between the shoreline and the LiMWA for areas where VE zones are not identified) will be similar to, but less severe than those in the VE zone. The LiMWA also determines the landward limit of the coastal A zone (CAZ). 
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain.

National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
New construction means any structure (see definition) for which the "start of construction" commenced after March 6, 1974 and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure. 
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after March 6, 1974. 
North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) as corrected in 1988 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
(a)  Built on a single chassis; 
(b)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(c)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(d)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(a)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or 
(b)  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the structure commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
V zone certificate means that the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations require coastal communities to ensure that buildings built in V zones are anchored to resist wind and water loads acting simultaneously. Buildings in V zones are subject to a greater hazard than buildings in other types of floodplains. Not only do they have to be elevated above the base flood elevation (BFE), they must be protected from the impact of waves, hurricane-force winds, and erosion. A registered professional engineer or architect must certify that the design and planned methods of construction meet NFIP requirements. The community must maintain a copy of this certification in the permit file for all structures built or substantially improved in the V zone. If breakaway walls are used to enclose areas below the building that exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 pounds per square feet, those walls must also be certified by the registered professional engineer or architect. 
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

ARTICLE III. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 11-51. - General standards. 
In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(a)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
(b)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
(c)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
(d)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. (Not applicable in coastal high hazard areas). 
(1)  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
i.  Provide a minimum of two openings on opposing walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
ii.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and, 
iii.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
(2)  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area. 
(3)  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
(4)  The building permit applicant (owner or agent) must sign a "Non-conversion agreement for certain structures in the floodplain," a document provided by the floodplain administrator. The non-conversion agreement provides the right to the floodplain administrator to inspect the enclosed area at any time. The document will be recorded and kept with the building file. This agreement will apply to all floor levels below the BFE that are protected by flood vents. 
(e)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(f)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(g)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system. 
(h)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters. 
(i)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(j)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
(Ord. No. 983, § 1(11-16), 9-6-2006; Ord. No. 1052, § 1, 12-20-2017) 
Sec. 11-52. - Specific standards. 
In all areas of special flood hazard designated as A1-30, AE, AH, A (with estimated BFE), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 11-51(d), "elevated buildings". 
a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Wood framed construction shall not be allowed as a structure's foundation system below the BFE plus one foot. FEMA approved types 4 and 5 flood resistant materials are allowed within the freeboard zone. CMU type exterior walls used in garages shall be erected to the BFE plus one foot. 
(2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify, using the latest version of the Flood-Proofing Certificate, FEMA form 086-0-34, that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 11-33(f). 
(3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an either existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that: 
(i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
(ii)  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 48 inches in height above grade. 
c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (ref. subsection 11-51(f) above). 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
(i)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
(ii)  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
(iii)  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)a. and c., above. 
(4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 11-6, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.

(b)  All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be elevated on piles, columns, or shear walls parallel to the flow of water so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal structural member (excluding pilings or columns) is located no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation level. All space below the lowest supporting member shall remain free of obstruction. Open lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action and in accordance with subsection (f) below. 
(c)  All new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be securely anchored on pilings, columns, or shear walls. 
(d)  Wood framed construction shall not be allowed as a structure's foundation system below the BFE plus one foot. 
(e)  All pile and column foundations and the structures attached thereto shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the combined effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components, both (non-structural and structural). Water loading values shall equal or exceed those of the base flood. Wind loading values shall be in accordance with the most current edition of the Standard Building Code. 
(f)  A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify, using a V zone certificate and elevation certificate, which the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the provisions contained in subsections (i), (j) and (k) herein.

1.  No solid walls shall be allowed. 
2.  Material shall consist of lattice or mesh screening only. 
3.  If aesthetic lattice work or screening is utilized, any enclosed space shall not be used for human habitation, but shall be designed to be used only for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises. 
4.  The enclosure must not exceed 299 square feet. 
(h)  Prior to construction, plans for any structures having latticework or decorative screening must be submitted to the administrator for approval. 
(i)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to any structure shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor except with latticework or decorative screening, as provided in this section. 
(j)  There shall be no fill used as structural support. Non-compacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, (thereby rendering the building free of obstruction) prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. The administrator shall approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect, and/or soil scientist, which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered: 
1.  Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction; 
2.  Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave defection to adjacent properties; and 
3.  Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping. 
(k)  There shall be no alteration of sand dunes or mangrove stands, which would increase potential flood damage. 
(l)  Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured homes park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of this section are met.

ARTICLE IV. - VARIANCE PROCEDURES 

Sec. 11-71. - Variances. 
(a)  The city commission shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  The city commission shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city commission may appeal such decision to the appropriate court, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the city commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
(h)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the administrator may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

(b)  Minimum requirements enumerated. The property owner and/or his agents shall follow sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resulting sedimentation consistent with the following requirements: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion. 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum. 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential. 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented. 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum. 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable. 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development. 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable. 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of this section. 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills. 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property. 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners. 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum. 
(14)  Erosion and sedimentation control plans shall include provisions for treatment to control any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent streams beyond the levels specified in subsection (17) of this section. 
(15)  Land-disturbing activities shall not be conducted within 25 feet of the banks of any state waters, as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented; provided, however, that buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq. title shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph; and 
(16)  Land-disturbing activities shall not be conducted within 100 horizontal feet, as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, of the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-29 unless a variance for such activity is granted by the director except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. 
(17)  a.  1.  Discharges of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas shall be controlled to the extent that turbidity of the stormwater runoff shall not exceed 100 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) higher than the turbidity level of the receiving stream immediately upstream from the stormwater runoff discharge at the time of such discharge; provided, however, that for trout streams, such maximum allowable turbidity level shall be 50 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) higher than the turbidity level of such stream immediately upstream from the stormwater runoff discharge at the time of such discharge. Due to the various soils and hydrological and water conditions throughout the state, the division shall have the discretion to vary from the aforesaid nephelometric turbidity units (NTU). 
2.  On or after July 1, 1994, the board of natural resources shall be authorized to establish the maximum allowable turbidity levels at higher or lower levels or establish an equivalent method of determining the amount of sedimentation with corresponding standards by rule or regulation, but only after the board has considered the results of a study of nephelometric turbidity unit levels and alternative stands done under the auspices of the board of regents. Upon the adoption of such rule or regulation, the provisions of subsection 1. of this subsection a. shall be superseded by the provisions of this subsection 2. 
b.  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent an issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection 17-4(b). 
1.  If during a ten-year rainfall event or a rainfall event of greater magnitude, stormwater runoff turbidity exceeds the levels provided for in subsection 17-4(b)(17) or other turbidity requirements adopted by an issuing authority, such exceeding of such levels shall not constitute a violation of the requirements provided for or authorized under this Code section of all such requirements other than those relating to turbidity have been met.

(c)  There shall be no free service offered by the City of Brunswick for solid waste sanitation service except as otherwise provided in this chapter.

--- (2) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 948, § 1, adopted Mar. 6, 2002, deleted former art. II of this chapter and added new provisions as art. II as herein set out. Former art. II, §§ 19-36—19-42, pertained to house numbering and derived from the 1953 Code, §§ 33.38—33.44. 

Sec. 19-36. - Title, scope, intent and administration. 
(a)  Title. This article shall be entitled the "City of Brunswick Addressing Code." 
(b)  Authority and scope This article is enacted pursuant to the provisions of the Georgia Emergency Telephone Number "911" Service Act of 1977, at Section 120 et seq. of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, as amended. All powers granted to the governing authority of the county by the statute are hereby incorporated by reference so as to be assumed, delegated and granted pursuant to this article. 
(c)  Intent. The purpose of this article is to enhance the easy and rapid location of properties by law enforcement, fire, rescue, and emergency medical service personnel in the incorporated area of the city. It is found and declared by the city commission that establishing a physical addressing process will ensure that the new addresses will provide the best address information for the enhanced 9-1-1 database which can be used by emergency service providers, as well as by mail delivery services, utilities, delivery services, and others, for the health, safety and welfare of the people of the city. 
(d)  Administration. The county GIS department is hereby authorized to and shall approve road names and assign numbers to all properties, and shall administer this article. The GIS department, fire department, and police department will coordinate the approval of road names. All requests shall be submitted to GIS. GIS will relay requests to the police and fire departments for approval. GIS will strive to provide address approval the same day unless a problem or concern exists. An example of a problem could consist of a road name request that already exists within the same ESN area. These problems or concerns will be submitted to the public safety committee for review and approval. Members of the public safety committee are the police chief, fire chief, heads of utilities and public works, or their designees. The public safety committee will make a determination within in five working days of receipt of the problem or concern from GIS. The decision of the public safety committee is final and binding on all parties. 
(Ord. No. 948, § 1, 3-6-2002) 
Sec. 19-37. - Definitions. 
The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this article, unless otherwise specifically stated. 
Addressing means the assigning of a numerical address and street name, which name shall be numerical, to each location within the incorporated area of the city and replaces any route and box numbers currently in place in the "911" database. 
ESN means emergency service number, a geographic overlay defining different emergency service areas. 
GIS means geographic information system, or its successor, presently a department of the county government, as established by the county board of commissioners. 
Person means owner of a house, dwelling unit, or place of business. 
Property means any lot on which a permanent structure or building has been erected or could be placed. 
Road means any highway, road, street, avenue, lane, private way or easement, or similar paved, gravel, or dirt passage way. 
(Ord. No. 948, § 1, 3-6-2002) 
Sec. 19-38. - Naming system. 
All roads that serve two or more properties shall be named. A road name approved by the GIS department for addressing purposes which has been assigned to a private road shall not constitute or imply acceptance of the road as a public way and shall include the letters "P.E." after the name. Each P.E. (private easement) must be named. The following criteria shall govern the naming system: 
(1)  No two roads shall be approved with the same name in the same ESN, except when the roads intersect perpendicularly to one another and the names are followed by different suffixes (e.g., Oak Road and Oak Lane). This exception shall only be granted if the road name does not currently exist elsewhere in the same ESN. 
(2)  No two roads shall be approved with similar sounding names (e.g., Beach Street and Peach Street) unless they exist in a different ESN. 
(3)  Existing duplicate road names will be changed unless roads are located in: 
a.  Different geographic areas, such as the mainland of unincorporated Glynn County, St. Simon Island, and Sea Island; or 
b.  Different emergency service number zones (ESN). 
(4)  Existing duplicate roads will be renamed in the following order: 
a.  Road impacting the larger number of residents shall maintain the existing name. 
b.  Length of time road name has been in use. 
(5)  The main entrance into a subdivision shall have the same name as the subdivision unless it constitutes a public safety issue. 
(6)  Each road shall have the same name throughout its entire length in the incorporated area of the city. When a state highway has numerous names, the highway number will be used as the E-911 road name. 
(7)  No two subdivisions, condominiums, apartment complexes, hotels/motels, or shopping centers within the same ESN will be approved with the same name. 
(8)  Shopping centers shall have a road name assigned to the general primary public access drive of the shopping center. The road shall have the same name as the shopping center as approved by the GIS department. 
(Ord. No. 948, § 1, 3-6-2002) 
Sec. 19-39. - Numbering system. 
Assignment of address numbers shall be based on linear feet. In residential areas, address numbers shall be assigned every 60 feet along both sides of a road where possible. In commercial areas, address numbers shall be assigned every ten feet along both sides of a road where possible. The following criteria shall govern the numbering system: 
(1)  Four-way and "T" type intersections shall be numbered in the same manner as residences. 
(2)  Numbers shall be assigned from the point of beginning of each road. For dead end roads, numbering shall originate at the intersection of the adjacent road and terminate at the dead end road.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 20-1. - Administration. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this article, the city clerk, as ex-officio tax commissioner, shall be charged with the duty to administer the imposition, collection, and enforcement of all taxes and special assessments levied or imposed by the city in accordance with the administrative procedures set forth in this article. The city clerk shall be assisted by the finance director and the city marshal, who shall have specific responsibilities set forth hereinafter. In any case where this article does not specifically provide a procedure, said officers shall act in the manner established for the collection of state and county taxes under applicable state law. 
(b)  In determining the fair market value of property within its taxing jurisdiction, the city shall use the fair market value as determined for the property for county ad valorem tax purposes, as provided by O.C.G.A. § 48-5-352. 
(c)  Following adoption of the budget for each fiscal year, the city commission shall adopt a resolution setting the millage rate upon which property subject to ad valorem tax will be billed for the current tax year. Prior to adoption of the mileage rate, the commission shall publish notice of the proposed ad valorem tax rate, as required by O.C.G.A. § 48-5-32. Millage rates shall be calculated using 40 percent of the assessed fair market value of the property upon which the tax is levied. 
(d)  The city clerk shall cause a bill to be sent to all taxpayers at the address last shown on the tax digest by regular U.S. mail, with adequate postage thereon to assure delivery; provided, however, that failure of the taxpayer to receive a bill shall not constitute grounds for nonpayment or late payment of the tax. The bill shall state the location or description of the property taxed, the fair market value of the property (100 percent) and its taxable value (40 percent of fair market value), the net amount of tax due thereon, and the due date after which taxes shall be in default. The bill shall also state such other information as may be required by law, including the information required by O.C.G.A. § 48-8-91 with respect to proceeds of the local option sales tax if applicable.

Supplemental ad valorem taxes and special assessments shall be due and payable on the date specified in the ordinance or resolution imposing the tax or assessments. 
(b)  All taxes and assessments imposed by the city shall be paid in full in legal tender of the United States; except where specially authorized by law or ordinance, no partial payments shall be accepted. 
(c)  Taxes and special assessments shall bear interest at an annual rate equal to the bank prime loan rate as posted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in statistical release H. 15 or any publication that may supersede it, plus three percent, to accrue monthly. Such annual interest rate shall be determined for each calendar year based on the first weekly posting of statistical release H. 15 on or after January 1 of each calendar year. Interest shall begin to accrue from the date the tax or assessment is due until the date the tax or assessment is paid. For purposes of this section, any period of less than one month shall be considered to be one full month. The city clerk shall be authorized to waive the collection of any interest, in whole or in part, due the city on unpaid taxes or assessments whenever or to the extent that the clerk reasonably determines that the delay in payment was attributable to action or inaction of the clerk's office. 
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-3-1999; Ord. No. 1054, § 1, 3-7-2018) 
Sec. 20-3. - Penalties. 
(a)  All penalties imposed by this article are part of the tax or assessment and are to be collected as such. The proceedings to collect the original tax, the tax constituted from penalties imposed, and the interest shall all be conducted in the same manner. Any provision of law for criminal prosecution shall not operate to relieve any taxpayer of any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this article. 
(b)  In any instance in which any taxpayer willfully fails to pay a tax or assessment within 120 days of the due date, such person shall pay a penalty of five percent of the amount of the tax due, together with interest as specified herein. After 120 days from the imposition of the initial penalty, an additional penalty of five percent of any tax amount remaining due shall be imposed, together with interest as specified by law. If any tax amount remains due after 120 days from the imposition of such additional penalty, a penalty of five percent shall be imposed, together with interest as specified by law. Should any tax amount remain due 120 days after such date, a penalty of five percent shall be imposed, together with interest as specified by law. The aggregate amount of penalties imposed pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed an amount equal to 20 percent of the principal amount of the tax originally due. 
(c)  The city commission may waive, in whole or in part, the collection of any amount due as a penalty under this article to the extent that said body finds and determines that the default giving rise to the penalty was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect or disregard of this article. 
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-3-1999; Ord. No. 1054, § 1, 3-7-2018) 
Sec. 20-4. - Executions on delinquent taxes and assessments.

(d)  All executions issued shall continue to bear interest and penalties at the rates established in this article for delinquent taxes and assessments. 
(e)  The city clerk shall cause all executions to be placed in the hands of the city marshal for collection or levy and sale of property. The marshal shall exercise his best efforts to collect the full amount of taxes and assessments due, together with all interest, penalties, and any costs due thereon, from the defendant in fi.fa. In the event he is unable to do so, the marshal shall levy the execution on a sufficient amount of the property of the defendant in fi.fa., whether real or personal, to satisfy the obligations due at a sale to be held and conducted in accordance with this article. 
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-3-1999) 
Sec. 20-5. - Levy of executions; sale of property. 
(a)  The chief of police is hereby designated as the marshal of the city, and he and any deputy marshal designated by him shall be responsible for carrying out the duties specified in this article. The marshal shall be subject to being ruled for money in his hands arising from the public sale of any property pursuant to process issued by the city clerk. After first paying the city clerk the amount due on any process under which the sale was made, the marshal shall pay any surplus to any lawful claimant holding an interest subordinate to the lien for taxes, else to the defendant in fi.fa. 
(b)  In all cases of levying on real property, written notice of the levy shall be given to the defendant in fi.fa. and to any tenants in possession personally or by certified mail within five days of the levy. If the land is unoccupied, a copy of the notice of levy shall also be conspicuously posted on the land. In the case of personal property, the marshal shall enter the same on the execution and plainly describe the property levied on and the amount of the interest of the defendant in fi.fa. therein. 
(c)  Whenever any real property is levied upon for taxes or assessments, it shall be the duty of the marshal, before proceeding to advertise the property for sale, to give 20 days' written notice of the levy to the record owner(s) of the property and the holder of each security deed of record. The 20-day period shall begin to run from the time the notice is personally delivered or, when delivered by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, from the date of mailing. The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the owner, the year or years for which the taxes were assessed, and a statement of the amount of taxes due, together with accrued costs. The marshal shall keep a copy of the notice on which he shall enter the date the notice was delivered or mailed and how, where, and to whom the notice was delivered. The marshal shall file the copy with the city clerk. 
(d)  When a levy is made upon real or personal property, the property shall be advertised and sold by the marshal in the same manner as provided for executions and judicial sales; provided, however, in addition to such other notice as may be required by law, the defendant in fi.fa. shall be given at least ten days' written notice of such sale by registered or certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the taxpayer at the last known address listed in the records of the county tax commissioner. In addition, if the United States has a claim or lien on the property subject to being sold and such lien was filed or recorded more than 30 days before the proposed sale, the marshal shall cause written notice of the sale to be given to the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate not less than 25 days before the sale. Notice may be given either by personal service or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. 
(e)  The marshal shall publish weekly for four weeks in the official legal organ of the county in which the sale will be conducted an advertisement of the date, place, and hours during which the sale will be conducted, together with a full and complete description of the property to be sold, making known the names of the owner(s) of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state the property is being sold for collection of taxes due to the city and the tax year(s) for which execution has been issued. 
(f)  Sales of property under execution shall be made by the marshal at City Hall, in the meeting room of the city commission, on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. eastern standard time or daylight savings time, whichever is applicable, and at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash; provided however, should the first Tuesday of the month fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sales shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. The purchaser shall look for himself as to the title and soundness of all property sold under tax executions and neither the marshal conducting the sale nor the city may make any representations or warranty of title, condition, or fitness for a particular purpose, expressed or implied. 
(g)  The marshal shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash, and upon collection of the sales price, make a deed or bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who becomes the purchaser of any property sold at the sale, who fails or refuses to comply with the terms of sale when requested by the marshal to do so shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money. It shall be the option of the marshal either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and then proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. A tax deed for real property or bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered as evidence of a sale for taxes conducted pursuant to this article shall convey the title as effectually as if the sale were made by the person against whom the process was issued. Sales of personal property shall be final; real property sold by virtue of an execution issued for the collection of taxes or for any special assessments is subject to redemption rights of the defendant in fi.fa or any person having any right, title or interest in or lien upon such property at the time of levy and sale. Recitals in a deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the instrument. The marshal shall put the purchaser in possession of the property so sold; provided, however, the purchaser of real property is not entitled to be placed in possession until after the time for redemption has expired. 
(h)  Whenever no bids are forthcoming on property to be sold for taxes after the property has been offered for a reasonable time, the marshal may either re-advertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The marshal shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and exposed for sale has been abandoned due to lack of bids. 
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-3-1999) 
Sec. 20-6. - Bidding by city at tax sales; disposition of property acquired. 
(a)  If during any sale of property for taxes and after the property has been offered a reasonable time no one present at the sale bids an amount for the property being sold which is as much as the total of the taxes due (including any priority liens for taxes due the state, county, and school and other special tax districts of the state) plus the marshal's cost due on the sale, then the city manager or his designee may purchase the property for the city. If the city purchases property at a sale, the marshal shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city manager. The marshal shall put the city in possession of the property so sold. 
(b)  Property acquired by the city pursuant to a sale for taxes or assessments may be divested or alienated by the city only by public sale of the property to the highest bidder; however when the city has not parted with title to the property, the city may quitclaim the property to the owner at the time of the tax sale, or to the owner's administrators, executors, heirs, or assigns, upon full payment of the redemption price provided in section 20-9 of this article. 
(c)  The right of redemption in real property purchased by the city at a tax sale shall be foreclosed in the manner set forth in section 20-9 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-3-1999) 
Sec. 20-7. - Accounting by marshal; final return or settlement. 
(a)  The marshal shall make a prompt accounting to the city clerk for all executions placed in his hands for collection or levy and sale. He shall pay over to the city clerk all amounts due the city for taxes and assessments, interest, penalties, and costs and shall file a final written return or settlement showing the amounts so paid, together with disposition of any excess proceeds derived from the sale. If there is any excess after paying taxes, costs, and all expenses of a sale, it shall be immediately paid to the person authorized to receive the excess. 
(b)  In any event, if, within 90 days form the date executions are placed in his hands, the marshal finds an execution to be either uncollectible or not collectible in full, he shall so notify the city clerk in writing. 
(c)  It shall be the duty of the clerk to cause cancellation of executions on the general execution docket upon their final payment or collection. 
(Ord. No. 937, § 1, 2-3-1999) 
Sec. 20-8. - Garnishments by city; reduction of executions to judgment. 
(a)  Whenever the marshal can find no property belonging to a defendant in fi.fa on which to levy any tax execution in his hands, he shall make an entry to the effect on the execution.

Sec. 22-7.1. - Water on separate meter used for landscape irrigation only. 
(a)  Water conservation: All irrigation systems shall be designed, installed, maintained, altered, repaired, serviced, and operated in a manner that shall prevent the waste of water, promotes the most efficient use of water, and applies the least amount of water that is required to maintain healthy individual plant material or turf and control erosion. 
(b)  Definitions: As used in this section the following words shall mean: 
Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of water or mixtures of water and other liquids, gasses, or other substances into the distribution pipes of the utility's potable supply of water from any source or sources. 
Backflow prevention assembly means an assembly used to prevent backflow into the utility's potable water system. The type of assembly used should be based on the degree of hazard or pollution which may impair or have an adverse effect on the quality of potable water. 
(c)  Application: All users of the water of the unified system shall submit an application to the director, or his designee, for the installation of separate meter for landscape or irrigation purposes. The application must be completed, submitted and approved by the director prior to installation. The director, or his designee, may not approve the application for an irrigation meter when the existing water main does not provide sufficient water volume or pressure to support the demand of an irrigation system without causing unacceptably low water pressure for other customers on the same water main, or when installation of the meter would cause a situation which is likely to create an imminent hazard to the utility's water distribution system. No meter will be issued when the utility determines, based on USGS geological study results, that the Floridan Aquifer, or any other aquifer, supplying the water to the customer is in distress. 
(d)  Fees, rates and charges; billing: The costs associated with installing a landscape or irrigation meter shall be set forth in the utility's rate resolution, as amended from time to time. A monthly bill will be provided to customers itemizing irrigation only meters.

Sec. 22-37. - Local discharge limits. 
Using EPA approved methodology, the utility has established local discharge limits for the pollutants of concern to the POTW. These limits are designed to protect the receiving stream, prevent interference with POTW operations and protect the quality of the sludge produced by the POTW. These limits apply to all users of the system. For industrial users subject to national categorical pretreatment standards, the local limit will be compared to the categorical limit and the lower value will be used. The utility reserves the right to set higher discharge limits for individual industrial users provided that the following conditions apply: 
(a)  There are no other industrial users discharging the pollutant of concern or if there are other significant industrial users discharging the pollutant of concern they are discharging below the established limit; 
(b)  If any other significant industrial users are discharging the pollutant of concern they agree to accept a lower limit; and 
(c)  The total combined loading on the POTW will not exceed the established maximum head works loading. 
(1)  A user which desires to have a higher local discharge limit should petition the director in writing. 
(2)  Any discharge to the POTW that contains concentrations of conventional pollutants above the local discharge limit will be subject to surcharges as provided in the current rate resolution. For purposes of this article conventional pollutants are considered biochemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and oil and grease. 
(3)  All other regulated pollutants are considered non-conventional pollutants and any discharge to the POTW that contains concentrations of these pollutant(s) above the local discharge limit will be subject to an enforcement action as provided in this article. 
(d)  Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. The utility may impose mass limitations on industrial users that are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 1014, § 1, 5-4-2010) 
Sec. 22-38. - National categorical pretreatment standards. 
The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 C.F.R. Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are incorporated herein by reference. 
(a)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 C.F.R. 403.6(c). 
(b)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 C.F.R. 403.6(e). 
(c)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 C.F.R. 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard.

(a)  Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in section [22-36] of this chapter within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State of Georgia, or the director, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the director for review, and shall be acceptable to the director before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the utility under the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  Additional pretreatment measures. 
(1)  Whenever deemed necessary, the utility may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sanitary waste streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter. 
(2)  The director may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on his or her own property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
(3)  The utility may, upon notification, require users to install a suitable control manhole together with the necessary meters and other appurtenances to facilitate the observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at the owner's expense, and shall be maintained by the owner in a safe and accessible condition at all times. 
(4)  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter. 
(c)  Accidental discharge/slug control plans. At least once every two years, the utility shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The utility may require a user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW superintendent of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by subsection [22-42(g)] of this chapter; and 
[4]  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(d)  Hauled waste. 
(1)  Hauled waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by the director, and at such times as are established by the director. The director may require haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits. Such permits may be revoked at any time if, in the opinion of the director, continued dumping of such matter into the sewers will be injurious to the sewer system or treatment processes. 
(2)  A charge shall be made for the privilege of dumping hauled waste. A record shall be kept of such dumps and statements rendered at the first of each month, the amount of such statements shall be payable within ten days after rendition. Failure to pay the amounts due within such ten-day period shall be cause for revoking the permit. 
(3)  The director may require generators of hauled waste to obtain permits. The director also may prohibit the disposal of hauled waste into the POTW. 
(4)  The director may require the hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.

(4)  Significant industrial users are required to notify the utility immediately of any changes at its facility effecting the potential for a slug discharge. 
(g)  Reports of potential problems. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to accidental discharges, discharges of non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the plant director of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(2)  Within five days following such discharge in subsection (g)(1), above, the user shall, unless waived by the utility, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability, which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
(3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (g)(1), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(h)  Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the utility as the utility may require. 
(i)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by the user indicates a violation, the user must notify the utility within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the utility within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the utility monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the utility samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(j)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(1)  A user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. Notifications of changed conditions, however, must be submitted under subsection (f), above. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsection [22-41(b)(1)] and subsection [22-43(a)(1)] of this chapter. 
(2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (1), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 C.F.R. 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  In the cases of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the utility, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and Georgia Hazardous Waste Department authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(k)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 C.F.R. Part 136 does not contain then sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. 
(l)  Sample collection. 
(1)  Except as indicated in paragraph (2) below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is not feasible, the utility may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(m)  Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(n)  Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, name of the person(s) taking the samples, the date(s) analysis was performed, who performed the analysis, the analytical techniques or methods used, and the results of such analysis. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the utility, or when the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the utility.

The utility shall publish annually, in the legal organ of Glynn County, a list of the users, which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean any one or more of the following: 
(a)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period exceed, by any magnitude, a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defend by 40 C.F.R. 403(1). 
(b)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 C.F.R. 403.3(1) multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH). 
(c)  Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement that the utility determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public. 
(d)  Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to the human health, welfare or to the environment, or has resulted in the utility's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge. 
(e)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the schedule date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance. 
(f)  Failure to provide, within 45 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules. 
(g)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance. 
(h)  Any other violation(s) which the utility determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Ord. No. 1014, § 1, 5-4-2010) 
Sec. 22-46. - Service charges. 
The utility may adopt charges and fees, which may include: 
(a)  Fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the utility's pretreatment program. 
(b)  Fees for monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures. 
(c)  Fees for reviewing accidental discharge procedures and construction. 
(d)  Fees for permit applications. 
(e)  Fees for filing appeals. 
(f)  Fees for consistent removal by the utility of pollutants otherwise subject to federal pretreatment standards. 
(g)  Other fees as the utility may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. 
These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this article and are separate from all other fees chargeable by the utility. The applicable charges shall be set forth in the utility's rate resolution. 
(Ord. No. 1014, § 1, 5-4-2010) 
Sec. 22-47. - Administrative enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Notification of violation. When the utility finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, or a wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director, or his designee, may serve upon said user written notice of violation by personal service or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. Within ten days of the receipt date of the notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the director, or his designee. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the utility to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(b)  Consent orders. The director is authorized to enter into consent orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with a user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as compliance orders issued pursuant to subsection (d), below, and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(c)  Show cause hearing. The director may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article or wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user including, but not limited to, immediate enforcement action. 
(d)  Compliance order. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article or a permit or order issued thereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time period. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may contain such other requirements to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(e)  Cease and desist order. When the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the director may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct the user to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(f)  Administrative fines. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, when the utility finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the utility may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation. Each day on which noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. Such assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charge. 
(1)  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after ten calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of seven percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of seven percent per month. A lien against the user's real property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties provided the owner of such real property is the person who incurred the charges. 
(2)  Users desiring to dispute administrative fines must file a written request with the director seeking reconsideration of the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within ten days of being notified of the fine. When the director determines a request has merit, the director may convene a hearing on the matter within 15 days of receipt of such request from the user. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment shall be returned to the user without interest. 
(3)  The utility may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(g)  Emergency suspensions. 
(1)  The director may immediately suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater permit of a user when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the POTW, or the environment. 
(2)  A user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals or the environment. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless termination proceedings set forth in subsection (h), below, are initiated against the user. A user who is the subject of a suspension order shall have the right to appeal to the director from such suspension, but such suspension shall remain in full force and effect pending such hearing and the decision of the director. 
(3)  A user who is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under subsection (c), above, or subsection (h), below. 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension. 
(h)  Termination of permit. Significant industrial users proposing to discharge into the POTW must first obtain a wastewater discharge permit from the utility. A user who violates the following conditions of this chapter or a wastewater discharge permit or order, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or any applicable state or federal law, is subject to permit termination: 
(1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(3)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, or wastewater constituents and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(4)  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(5)  Repeatedly violates this chapter. 
Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of the proposed termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (c), above, why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the utility shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(i)  Termination of services. The director may order a user who violates, or continues to violate, this chapter, or allows an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW, to show cause before the director as to why termination of services should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the director regarding the termination of services, the reasons why the action is to be taken, and directing the user to show cause before the director why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. 
(1)  The director may take evidence and hear witnesses. 
(2)  After the director has reviewed the evidence, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service will be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are properly installed and/or operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued. 
Exercise of this option by the utility shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 1014, § 1, 5-4-2010) 
Sec. 22-48. - Judicial remedies. 
When a user discharges sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into the wastewater disposal system contrary to the provisions of this article, or violates, or continues to violate, any order or permit issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the utility may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in a court having jurisdiction over such matters. 
(a)  Injunctive relief. When the utility finds a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article or any order or permit issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the utility may petition the court for the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The utility may seek also such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user including, but not limited to, nuisance abatement proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
(b)  Civil penalties. 
(1)  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article or any order or permit issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, shall be liable to the utility for a civil penalty of up to $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of violation. In addition to the above described penalty, the utility may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with the enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the POTW and utility, and any economic benefit gained through the user's violation. 
(2)  The utility shall petition a court of competent jurisdiction to impose, assess, and recover such sums set forth in subsection (b)(1), above. In determining the amount of liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(c)  Criminal prosecution. 
(1)  A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this article, any orders or permits issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 60 days, or both. 
(2)  A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 60 days, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available to the utility. 
(3)  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than 60 days, or both. 
(d)  Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. The director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(Ord. No. 1014, § 1, 5-4-2010) 
Sec. 22-49. - Supplemental enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Liability insurance. The director may decline to reissue a permit to any industrial user which has failed to comply with any provision of this article, or any order or previous permit issued hereunder, unless the industrial user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair POTW damage caused by its discharge. 
(b)  Water supply severance. When an industrial user has been found after hearing to be in violation of any provision of this article, or an order issued hereunder, water service to the industrial user may be severed and service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
(Ord. No. 1014, § 1, 5-4-2010) 
Sec. 22-50. - Affirmative defenses. 
(a)  Treatment upsets. 
(1)  For the purposes of this article, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (a)(3), below, are met. 
(3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(5)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(b)  Treatment bypass. 
(1)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection (b). 
(2)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, then it shall submit prior notice to the director at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
a.  A user shall submit oral notice to the director of an anticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause, the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue, and the steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. 
b.  The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(3)  Bypass is prohibited. The director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage including, but not limited to, substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not include economic loss caused by delays in production; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (2) of this subsection (b). 
d.  The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (b)(3)a—c. of this section. 
(c)  Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section [22-36] of this chapter, except for subsections [22-36(d)(1), (2) and (9)] of this chapter, if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the utility was regularly in compliance with its NPDES and/or LAS permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(Ord. No. 1014, § 1, 5-4-2010) 
Secs. 22-51—22-60. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE IV. - RATES AND FEES 

Sec. 22-61. - User charge system. 
(a)  Charges for water service and for wastewater service shall be made and billed in compliance with the user charge system approved by the utility with adjusted rates herein established; except, however, the utility may suspend or forego the imposition and collection of connection/capital tap fees at any time when determined to be in the best interests of utility. The user charge system shall be: 
(1)  A base rate shall be charged based on the administration and debt costs and shall be calculated based on the number of water and wastewater customers and the assignment of REUs. Every customer connected to the utility system will pay a base rate each month regardless of usage; 
(2)  A consumption rate shall be charged based on the metered volume of water used by each water and each wastewater customer for the operation, maintenance, and replacement costs incurred by the utility to be calculated on the basis of water used per 1,000 gallons; and 
(3)  Water and wastewater tap fees consists of two components, connection/capital tap fees and installation/operational tap fees. The customer at whose request for connection is made shall pay all fees and charges at the time an official request is made or at the time application is made for a building or plumbing permit, as applicable, and subject to the exception in paragraph (a), above. All tap fees are payable to the utility. 
a.  The connection/capital tap fee shall be calculated and charged on the basis of REUs. Any fractional units resulting from the calculation of REUs shall be treated as a whole unit. 
b.  The installation/operational tap fee shall be charged in accordance with schedules listed in the utility's current rate resolution. Installation/operational tap fees shall apply only to installations on mains that are adjacent to the location to be served; for any extensions necessary beyond this condition the actual costs shall be charged in addition to connection/capital tap fees and installation/operational tap fees. 
(b)  A user who discharges any toxic pollutants or other constituents which causes an increase in the cost of managing the effluent or the sludge of the aforementioned treatment works shall be required to pay for such increased costs. A surcharge will be applied to the overall strength of commercial or industrial wastewater based on the strength and volume of such wastes and the costs of treatment thereof. 
(c)  The utility shall review not less often than every two years water consumption and wastewater contribution of users, the total costs of operation and maintenance of the water and sewer systems, and the approved user charge system. The utility may revise the charges for users to accomplish the following: 
(1)  Maintain the proportionate distribution of operation and maintenance costs among users; 
(2)  Generate sufficient revenue to pay debt service, administrative costs, and total operation and maintenance costs necessary for proper operation and maintenance (including minor replacement) of the water and sewer systems; and 
(3)  Generate reserve fund contributions for emergency and/or capital planning requirements. 
(d)  The user charge system shall take precedence over any terms or conditions of agreements or contracts between the utility and users which are inconsistent with the requirements of Section 204(b)(1)(a) of the Act and 40 C.F.R. Part 35. 
(e)  The utility may collect samples for the purpose of determining surcharge and compliance, and may charge the industrial user for this service. 
(1)  The utility may require industrial users to sample and test at their own expense for the purposes of determining surcharges and permit compliance. 
(2)  In the event of a disagreement in results between samples collected by the industrial user and the utility, the utility results will prevail unless it can be proven that there was an error in utility sampling or testing protocol. 
(f)  Where a user has a private water source and discharges into the utility sanitary sewer system, said user shall be required to install a proper water flow measuring device and pay the user charges for sewer service in an amount equal to the amount charged if all water used was purchased from the utility, unless an accurate wastewater flow measuring device is installed, in which case the bill will be based on the wastewater meter. 
(g)  Timing of billing. Water and/or sewer charges shall accrue on a monthly basis from the date of connection and will be billed monthly thereafter. 
(Ord. No. 1014, § 1, 5-4-2010; Ord. No. 1020, § 1, 11-17-2010) 
Sec. 22-62. - Other rates, fees and charges. 
(a)  Charges for water and sewer service, tap fees, and other related fees and deposits or letters of credit, established in a rate resolution by the utility, will be as follows: 
(1)  When service has been cut-off for nonpayment or other action resulting in unauthorized use, service shall not be restored until the unpaid bill, either at the present location or at any previous location at which service was supplied to the applicant, and the service fees provided by the rate resolution are satisfied, including the following cumulative fees for each action taken to prevent unauthorized use of utility services: 
a.  Turn-on after a delinquent cut-off. 
b.  Locking meter. 
c.  Removal of meter. 
d.  Removal of straight line. 
e.  Removal of unauthorized relocated meter. 
f.  Cutting off water at main. 
(2)  Payment of the fees in paragraph (1) above shall not exempt a user from any civil or criminal action resulting from violations of this chapter. 
(b)  In addition to the fees and deposits, each applicant for service shall pay in advance an account establishment charge for either new service or transfer of service from one location to another. 
(c)  Connection fees and deposits for a facility will be based on the facility's REUs. The amount of REUs is determined by the flow characteristics as set forth in the REU table of the utility's rate resolution, as amended from time to time. In the case of existing facilities with an increase in REUs, additional fees and charges will be due. 
(d)  Deposits will be required for all customer accounts. The deposit may increase by a factor of 250 percent if the customer has a history of three or more issuances of non-sufficient funds checks, cut-offs for non-payment, or an account with the utility has been turned over to collections in the previous 24 months. A deposit will be refunded upon termination of service; provided, however, any deposit for a single-family residential account for water and/or sewer service connected to the system by an individual meter will be automatically credited to the customer's account after 36 months of consecutive timely payments for accounts in good standing, as set forth under the criteria in the utility's rate resolution. All refunds will be the actual amount paid as a deposit. No interest will be paid on deposits for refunding purposes. 
(e)  The utility may refuse to supply service to any customer if there is a delinquent account for water and/or sewer service until the bill for all prior charges billed to that customer both at the present location or at a previous location have been paid by the customer owing the outstanding amount. 
(Ord. No. 1014, § 1, 5-4-2010; Ord. No. 1038, § 4, 1-7-2014) 
Sec. 22-63. - Leak adjustments in water and sewer billing. 
The utility recognizes that occasionally water service lines may develop hidden leaks, leading to unusually high water bills. The utility encourages customers to make prompt and permanent repairs while showing consideration for unusual circumstances without burdening the utility's other customers with the expenses of an individual customer's lost water. Accordingly, the utility, under certain circumstances, provides customers the opportunity to request a leak adjustment in their water and/or sewer bill. This section shall not apply to irrigation metered service. 
(a)  For purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply: 
(1)  "Physical damage" means damage to a facility or equipment supplying water to the premises and the damage: 
a.  Is not visible or detectable in the customer's premises except upon excavation or some other disturbance of the property; and 
b.  Is not the result of an act of the customer, or of any agent or contractor hired by the customer. 
(2)  "[Unusually] high water bill" means a water and/or sewer bill for a particular month that reflects monthly water usage, in whatever units measured, that is at least two times the customer's average monthly usage of the premises as measured during the previous 12 monthly billing periods. 
(b)  The customer retains control over the use of water on the customer's premises, and as such, the customer is responsible for all the water passing through the meter, including water which may be lost or wasted through leaking pipes or fixtures on the premises. The customer is responsible for monitoring for unusually high water usage as reflected on the customer's bill. The customer must promptly investigate any unusually high water bills. A customer is required to repair any water leak promptly, and the customer is responsible for all repair costs. 
(c)  A customer may seek an adjustment under this chapter to an unusually high water bill caused by physical damage to the customer's water service line. A customer may not receive an adjustment unless the customer has paid all outstanding water and sewer bills owed prior to the unusually high water bill. 
(d)  A customer is not eligible for a leak adjustment to an unusually high water bill due to circumstances not caused by an undetected leak, leaks that should reasonably have been discovered, high usage caused by negligence or failure to properly maintain pools or water using/consuming items or usage from appliances whether or not operating properly. 
(e)  A customer seeking a water bill adjustment must provide written notice to the director, or his designee, within 60 days of the end of the billing period for which the adjustment is being requested. The written notice/request shall contain the following information: 
(1)  The name, address, and telephone number of the customer reporting the leak; 
(2)  A description of how the leak was discovered; 
(3)  The date the leak was discovered; 
(4)  The nature and location of the leak; 
(5)  The date the leak was repaired; and 
(6)  A description of the repair work completed. 
The customer shall provide any other information, documents, or access requested by the director as may be necessary or appropriate for investigating the circumstances of any alleged leak and/or related repairs and verifying the customer's eligibility for an adjustment. 
(f)  The adjustment period for undetected leaks cannot exceed one regular meter reading period, unless (i) the meter reading was missed during the leak period, or (ii) the leak affected two connective bills. 
(g)  If the director, or his designee, determines, upon investigation, that a customer is eligible for a leak adjustment, then the director, or his designee, is authorized to adjust the unusually high water bill as follows: 
(1)  The customer shall be responsible for an amount of the water and/or sewer bill equal to four times the customer's average monthly consumption, as calculated by averaging the prior 12 months bills before the leak, or any portion of the prior 12 months if the customer has fewer than 12 previous bills; plus an amount for the adjustments set forth below. 
(2)  For those amounts of the bill above four times the normal bill, the director, or his designee, may provide an adjustment reducing the bill amount that is more than four times the normal bill by 75 percent. 
(3)  The customer may pay the adjusted water and/or sewer bill in equal payments over a 12 month billing period in addition to the regular applicable monthly billing. 
(4)  No adjustments will be made to the portions of the bill representing the fixed charges such as, for example, debt service. 
An illustration: A customer's normal (variable) average water and/or sewer bill is $50.00 and the customer receives an unusually high water bill for $500.00 that is caused by undetected damage to the water service line. The adjusted bill amount would be $275.00 (4 x $50.00 = $200.00; 75% x $300.00 = $75.00 for a total of $275.00). 
(h)  The director's, or his designee's, determination of eligibility for a leak adjustment is a final disposition of the matter; provided, however, any leak adjustment totaling $2,000.00 or more shall be presented by the director to the commission for final determination.

Chapter 22A - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 
ARTICLE I. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 22A-1. - Findings of fact. 
It is hereby determined that: 
a.  Land development projects and associated changes in the landscape alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
b.  This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants; and 
c.  Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from existing and future development sites. 
Therefore, the city establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety. 
(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-1), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-2. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. This article seeks to meet that purpose through regulation of activities that can through proper regulation improve and maintain those water resources that lie partially or wholly within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city. 
(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-2), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-3. - Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.

(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-28), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-59. - Waivers for providing stormwater management. 
Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required by this article, unless a written request is filed to waive this requirement. Requests to waive the stormwater management plan requirements shall be submitted to the DRT for approval. The minimum requirements for stormwater management may be waived in whole or in part upon written request of the applicant, provided that at least one of the following conditions applies: 
a.  It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this article. 
b.  Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater management plan that has been approved by the DRT and local ordinance or legal developer agreement requires the implementation of the plan. 
c.  Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility. The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the stormwater practice. 
d.  The DRT finds that meeting the minimum on-site management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical characteristics of a site. 
e.  Non-structural practices may be used on the site that reduce: a) the generation of stormwater from the site, b) the size and cost of stormwater storage; and c) the pollutants generated at the site. These non-structural practices shall be explained in detail in the local or state design manual and the amount of credit available for using such practices shall be determined by the DRT if the city provides for stormwater credits in the review process. 
(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-29), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-60. - Conditions of waiver.

a.  The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. These lands should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
b.  The creation of a stormwater management facility or other drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public or private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed in accordance with the purposes and standards of this article; and 
c.  Monetary contributions (fee-in-lieu) to fund stormwater management activities such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland delineation studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and macroinvertebrates, stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species studies, hydrologic studies, and monitoring of stormwater management practices, etc.). 
(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-31), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-62. - Fee in lieu of stormwater management practices. 
Where the DRT waives all or part of the minimum stormwater management requirements, or where the waiver is based on the provision of adequate stormwater facilities provided downstream of the proposed development, the applicant may be required to pay a fee in an amount as determined by the DRT. 
When an applicant obtains a waiver of the required stormwater management, the monetary contribution required shall be in accordance with a fee schedule (unless the developer and city agree on a greater alternate contribution) established by the DRT. All of the monetary contributions shall be credited to an appropriate capital improvements program project, and shall be made by the developer prior to the issuance of any permit for the development. 
(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-32), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-63. - Dedication of land. 
In lieu of a monetary contribution, an applicant may obtain a waiver of the required stormwater management by entering into an agreement with the city for the granting of an easement or the dedication of land by the applicant, to be used for the construction of an off-site stormwater management facility. The agreement shall be entered into by the applicant and the city prior to the recording of plats or, if no record plat is required, prior to the issuance of the building permit. 
(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-33), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-64. - Performance criteria. 
Unless judged by the DRT to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at all sites. 
(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-34), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-65. - Peak runoff rate control. 
The applicant shall control all stormwater discharges from the proposed project such that post development peak runoff rates do not exceed pre-development peak runoff rates for the two-year, five-year, ten-year, 25-year, 50-year and 100-year frequency storms, unless otherwise specified or the DRT grants the applicant a waiver or the applicant is exempt from such requirements. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the DRT reserves the right to impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff. 
a.  An emergency overflow device (which does not include the throttling device) for a detention pond shall be designed to pass the 100-year peak developed inflow without overtopping the dam. 
b.  The steepest fill slopes shall be 2.5:1, and cut slopes shall be no steeper than 2:1. 
c.  An eight-foot-wide access road which runs on top of the dam shall be required around the circumference of the pond. 
d.  If a pond is deeper than four feet, a chain link fence shall be required. 
1.  The fence shall be six feet high. 
2.  Fence posts shall be set in concrete ten feet on centers. 
3.  There shall be a minimum ten-foot-wide gate for access. 
4.  The fence shall not be installed across the slope of a dam or dike, but installed completely around the pond and containing the dike and access road. 
5.  The DRT may require a planted vegetation buffer around all or part of the pond. 
(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-35), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-66. - Channel protection. 
To protect stream channels from degradation, a specific channel protection criteria shall be provided. The channel protection criteria may be waived by the DRT for sites that discharge directly into larger streams, rivers, wetlands, lakes, estuaries, or tidal waters where the reduction in smaller flows will not have an impact on stream bank or channel integrity. Additionally, the DRT may waive the channel protection criteria if the post development peak runoff rate for the channel protection criteria is less than two cubic feet per second (cfs) for the one-year 24-hour storm in a post-development state. 
Channel protection shall be provided through 24-hour extended detention of the one-year 24-hour rainfall event, unless the DRT grants the applicant a waiver or the applicant is exempt from such requirements. If the applicant provides for channel protection, the applicant shall not be required to provide detention as specified in section 22A-65 for the two-year, five-year and ten-year frequency storms. 
(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-36), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-67. - Water quality control. 
For new development, stormwater treatment practices shall be designed to remove pollutants to levels prescribed. It is presumed that a BMP complies with this performance standard if it is: 
1.  Sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume (WQ v ). 
2.  Designed according to the specific performance criteria applied to the treatment practice. 
3.  Constructed properly, and maintained regularly. 
This article follows the philosophy of removing pollutants to the "maximum extent practicable" through the use of a percentage removal performance goal. The approach to be taken is to treat a water quality volume of runoff equal to that generated by 1.2 inches of rainfall (WQ v ) to remove 80 percent of the annual total suspended solids (TSS) loading commonly found in urban stormwater runoff, unless the DRT grants the applicant a waiver or the applicant is exempt from such requirements. The applicant shall reference section 2.1.7 of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM) Volume 2, First Edition for the approved methodology for calculating the WQ v . 
All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not discharge untreated stormwater directly into a wetland or local water body without adequate treatment. Stormwater management practices for a site shall be chosen based on the physical conditions of the site. Additionally, stormwater management practices that utilize vegetation as part of the functional treatment process (e.g. constructed wetlands, etc.) must submit a separate landscaping plan detailing both the vegetation to be in the practice and how and who will manage and maintain this vegetation. 
(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-37), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-68. - Conveyance issues. 
All conveyances including pipes and open channels except those associated with detention facilities shall be designed for the 25-year frequency storm. Inlets for conveyances shall be designed for an equal frequency storm (i.e. 25-year storm design pipe system shall have all inlets sized for the 25-year storm). The DRT reserves the right to increase the requirements outlined herein where deemed necessary. All pipes placed within an easement or on public right-of-way for maintenance by the city shall be reinforced concrete pipe (RCP). 
(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-38), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-69. - Sensitive resources. 
Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources (i.e., fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming beaches, recharge areas, etc.) may be subject to additional performance criteria, or may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices. 
(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-39), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-70. - Hot spots. 
Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher potential pollutant loadings, known as "hotspots", may require the use of specific BMPs and pollution prevention practices. 
(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-40), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-71. - Stormwater management plan required for all developments. 
No application for development will be approved unless it includes a stormwater management plan detailing in concept how runoff and associated water quality impacts resulting from the development will be controlled or managed. This plan must indicate whether stormwater will be managed on-site or off-site and, if on-site, the general location and type of practices. 
The stormwater management plan(s) shall be referred for comment to all other interested agencies, and any comments must be addressed in a final stormwater management plan. This final plan must be signed by a licensed professional engineer (PE). No development related permits shall be issued until a satisfactory final stormwater management plan, or a waiver thereof, shall have undergone a review and been approved by the DRT after determining that the plan or waiver is consistent with the requirements of this article. 
(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-41), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-72. - Stormwater management plan requirements. 
A stormwater management plan shall be required with all permit applications and will include sufficient information (e.g., maps, hydrologic calculations, etc) to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project site, the potential impacts of all proposed development of the site, both present and future, on the water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the measures proposed for managing stormwater generated at the project site. The intent of this planning process is to determine the type of stormwater management measures necessary for the proposed project, and ensure adequate planning for management of stormwater runoff from future development. To accomplish this goal the applicant will prepare a design report, which shall include elements sufficient to ensure compliance with this article. These reports shall include at a minimum: a narrative description of the proposed development project and its changes to the site, predevelopment drainage maps, post development drainage maps, predevelopment runoff rates, post development rates, lists of assumptions used in calculating drainage impacts, and calculations of drainage impacts. The DRT reserves the right to extend these requirements to ensure compliance with this article. However, in these cases, the DRT must provide a written explanation of the additional elements needed to the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-42), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-73. - Performance bond/security. 
The city may, at its discretion, require the submittal of a performance security or bond prior to issuance of a permit in order to ensure that the stormwater practices are installed by the permit holder as required by the approved stormwater management plan. The amount of the installation performance security shall be the total estimated construction cost of the stormwater management practices approved under the permit, plus 25 percent as agreed to by the applicant and the city. The performance security shall contain forfeiture provisions for failure to complete work specified in the stormwater management plan. 
The installation performance security shall be released in full only upon submission of "as built plans" and written certification by a registered professional engineer that the stormwater practice has been installed in accordance with the approved plan and other applicable provisions of this article. The DRT will make a final inspection of the stormwater practice to ensure that it is in compliance with the approved plan and the provisions of this article. Provisions for a partial pro-rata release of the performance security based on the completion of various development stages can be done at the discretion of the DRT. 
(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-43), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-74. - Notice of construction commencement. 
The applicant must notify the DRT in advance before the commencement of construction so as to provide for scheduling of inspections. If any violations are found, the property owner shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions. The DRT may issue a "stop work order" if the DRT determines that the corrective actions will need to be made prior to continuance of other development activities on the site to ensure compliance with this article. In these cases, no added work shall proceed until any violations are corrected and all work previously completed has received approval by the DRT. 
(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-44), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-75. - As built plans. 
All applicants are required to submit actual "as built" plans for any stormwater management practices located on-site after final construction is completed in a format specified by the DRT. The plan must show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and must be certified by a professional engineer. A final inspection by the DRT is required before the release of any performance securities can occur. 
(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-45), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-76. - Maintenance easement. 
Prior to the issuance of any permit that has a stormwater management facility as one of the requirements of the permit, the applicant or owner of the site must execute a maintenance easement agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the stormwater management facility. The agreement shall provide for access to the facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the DRT or their contractor or agent, and for regular or special assessments of property owners to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and any other provisions established by this article. The easement agreement shall be recorded by the applicant in the land records. The minimum width of an easement for pipe systems shall be 20 feet, however the [review authority] may increase this requirement for systems that are deeper than six feet in depth. Minimum width of an easement for an open channel shall be the width of the channel at the top of slope plus ten feet either side of the channel. All other easements for structures including but not limited to detention ponds, etc. shall be ten feet beyond the facilities footprint. 
(Ord. No. 984, § 1(22A-46), 12-13-2006) 
Sec. 22A-77. - Maintenance covenants. 
Maintenance of all stormwater management facilities shall be ensured through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be approved by the DRT and recorded into the land record prior to final plan approval. As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater management facility. Stormwater management facilities may be required to undergo annual inspections to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of this article and accomplishment of its purposes. These needs may include; removal of silt, litter and other debris from all catch basins, inlets and drainage pipes, grass cutting and vegetation removal, and necessary replacement of landscape vegetation. Any maintenance needs found must be addressed in a timely manner and the inspection and maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater management facility. The requirement for such inspections shall be outlined in the maintenance covenant.

ARTICLE XXII-B. - PARKWOOD VILLAGE PLANNED DEVELOPMENT (TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD) HEIGHT OVERLAY 

Sec. 23-22B-1. - Creation of Planned Development-Overlay. 
There is hereby created a new zoning district to be known as the Parkwood Village PD-TN Height Overlay. It is created pursuant to the provisions of the City Code's PD-TN ordinance (Article XVI of the Code, sections 23-16-1 et seq.). 
(Ord. No. 1006, § 1, 11-19-2008) 
Sec. 23-22B-2. - Overlay boundary. 
The Parkwood Village PD-TN Height Overlay District shall have as boundaries Parkwood Avenue on the north, US Highway 17/Glynn Avenue on the east, Kaiser Avenue on the south and Springdale Road in the west, as depicted in the five page visual Concept Plan set consisting of sheets PD-TN-1 through PD-TN-4 (all dated November 21, 2005) and PD-TN-5 (November 22, 2005), prepared by architect Larry Evans, all of which are incorporated herein and made a part hereof.

(Ord. No. 1006, § 1, 11-19-2008) 
ARTICLE XXIII. - U.S. 17 OVERLAY 

Sec. 23-23-1. - Intent of overlay. 
It is the intent of this overlay to create a parkway along U.S. 17 from Spur 25 to the Sidney Lanier Bridge in order to improve the visual and economic condition along this section of U.S. 17. A parkway is a wide, scenic road planted with trees. This corridor is deemed by the city commission to be important because so many visitors get their first impression of Brunswick while driving along U.S. 17. The scenic vistas of the marsh are inherently and economically valuable to the public, and visual clutter impedes aesthetically and economically favorable development of the parkway area. The visual quality of the corridor and the general nature of development along the corridor must be improved to encourage visitors to explore more of the city. 
(Ord. No. 1006, § 1, 11-19-2008) 
Sec. 23-23-2. - Parkway development concepts. 
The comprehensive plan generally describes the U.S. 17 Parkway concept as a roadway with long vistas over the marsh and including heavily landscaped intersections at 4th Avenue, Gloucester Street, and the Torras Causeway. To supplement these elements the comprehensive plan recommends limiting curb cuts and establishing landscape and signage requirements for private development along the parkway. The concept does not alter permitted and conditional uses but follows the underlying zoning districts as to uses. Zoning districts are not altered by this overlay. 
(Ord. No. 1006, § 1, 11-19-2008) 
Sec. 23-23-3. - Overlay boundary. 
Generally, all lots fronting U.S. 17 from Spur 25 to the Sidney Lanier Bridge are included in the U.S. 17 Overlay (U.S.17-O). The overlay boundary extends from the U.S. 17 right-of-way onto the adjacent parcel for a distance not to exceed either, a) a maximum of 250 feet from U.S. 17 or b) a maximum depth of one parcel if the parcel adjacent to U.S. 17 is less than 250 feet in depth. In all cases, the overlay boundary shall be a minimum of 100 feet in depth except for lots of record. 
(Ord. No. 1006, § 1, 11-19-2008) 
Sec. 23-23-4. - Permitted uses. 
All uses permitted in the underlying zoning district shall be permitted in the U.S. 17 overlay. 
(Ord. No. 1006, § 1, 11-19-2008) 
Sec. 23-23-5. - Conditional uses. 
All uses permitted on a conditional basis and subject to the conditions set forth in the underlying zone district shall be permitted on a conditional basis in the U.S. 17 overlay subject to the conditions set forth in section 23-24-4. 
(Ord. No. 1006, § 1, 11-19-2008) 
Sec. 23-23-6. - Curb cuts. 
The recent improvements to U.S. 17 provided the existing parcels with sufficient access. The greatest concern is the addition of curb cuts along the southern portion of the parkway, between Gloucester Street and the Sidney Lanier Bridge. This portion of the parkway maintains expansive views of the marshes and has few intersections or curb cuts. To maintain the visual quality of the entire parkway, curb cuts shall be limited where possible; instead of creating curb cuts, it is recommended that adjacent parcels interconnect and share existing access points to U.S. 17. Along that portion of the parkway specifically existing between Gloucester Street and the Sidney Lanier Bridge, additional curb cuts are prohibited. 
(Ord. No. 1006, § 1, 11-19-2008) 
Sec. 23-23-7. - Landscape requirements. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of requiring canopy trees to be planted along the U.S. 17 Parkway is to promote the community's image, beautify the roadway, and establish the parkway concept. The addition of canopy trees in conjunction with coordinated signage requirements can yield an immediate and deeply needed improvement to the U.S. 17 Parkway corridor. 
(b)  Canopy tree location and spacing. Canopy trees shall be planted a minimum of 40 feet and a maximum of 50 feet on center and shall be located in the front setback parallel to the U.S. 17 Parkway. Lots with a width of 100 feet or less shall provide at least one canopy tree, lots with a width of 150 feet or less shall provide at least two canopy trees, and so on. Relief can be granted by staff for driveways, utilities and other unmovable obstructions. 
(c)  Canopy tree requirements Canopy trees shall be a minimum of ten feet in height, with a four- to five-foot spread, and a two-inch caliper trunk at time of planting. 
Table A 

 
;adv=6a;*(particularly "high rise" version) 
Existing trees 18 inches in caliper or greater and located in the front setback may count towards the tree requirement. All plantings shall be installed free from disease in a manner that ensures the availability of sufficient soil and water for healthy growth and which is not intrusive to underground utilities. Dead or diseased trees shall be removed. Replacement trees shall be provided for any required trees which die or are removed for any reason and shall meet all minimum standards and conform to these regulations. 
(d)  Canopy tree substitution. Due to the existence of utility lines along the U.S. 17 Parkway, understory trees may be substituted for canopy trees. A grouping of three or more palm trees shall be considered equivalent to one canopy tree. Palms shall have a minimum of ten feet of clear trunk at time of planting. Two understory trees shall be considered equivalent to one canopy tree. Understory trees shall be a minimum of eight feet in height, with a three- to four-foot spread, and a one and one-half-inch caliper trunk at time of planting. 
Table B 

 
(Ord. No. 1006, § 1, 11-19-2008) 
Sec. 23-23-8. - Signage requirements. 
(a)  Purpose. Increased numbers and size of signs distract the attention of motorists and interfere with traffic safety. More importantly, the indiscriminate erection and maintenance of signs seriously detracts from the enjoyment and pleasure in the natural scenic beauty of the city and, in turn, injuriously affects the economic well-being of the citizenry. The purpose of limiting signage is to increase traffic safety, enhance the scenic beauty of the U.S. 17 Parkway and improve the economic viability of this commercial corridor. 
(b)  Applicability. The requirements of this section shall apply to all signs constructed, placed, or replaced after December 15, 2004, in the U.S. 17 overlay and these requirements are in addition to article 24 of the this chapter. Provided, this chapter shall not preclude the replacement of any existing non-conforming sign which is damaged or destroyed by casualty (such as fire, wind, flood or vandalism) where the loss was not caused by the owner; in such event, if the sign is replaced the non-conformity may not be increased or varied (for example, a five hundred square foot sign that is 25 feet in height could not be replaced by a 600 square foot sign, nor by 150 feet in height). 
(c)  Signage limitations. 
(1)  Freestanding signs. 
a.  The maximum size and heights of freestanding signs in the U.S. 17 overlay shall be as follows: 
Table C 

 
b.  Lots serving five or more tenant spaces are permitted up to a 25 percent increase in the area of freestanding sign as permitted in subsection a., above. 
c.  Signs greater than 24 square feet are required to be monument signs. 
d.  The size of the support structure for any monument sign shall not exceed the size of the sign face by more than 25 percent of one side.

ARTICLE XXIV. - SIGNS AND ADVERTISING DEVICES 

Sec. 23-24-1. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  The City Commission of Brunswick finds that signs provide an important medium through which persons may convey a variety of commercial and non-commercial messages. Regulation of the size, location, placement, illumination and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to receive such messages without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the city, to take advantage of the city's natural and historic environment, to protect property values, to facilitate sage travel through the city, to facilitate the identification and location of residences and businesses in the city in the event of police, fire, or other emergencies, and to avoid the aesthetic blight and nuisance that would occur from the proliferation of signs in the absence of reasonable controls. Accordingly, it is the intention of the city commission to establish regulations governing the display of signs so as to: 
(1)  Balance the rights of persons to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs in the city. 
(2)  Enhance the economy and the business and industry of the city by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs; 
(3)  Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive plan; 
(4)  Protect the public health, safety, and welfare; 
(5)  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; 
(6)  Maintain the historical image of the city; 
(7)  Preserve and enhance natural vistas throughout the city; 
(8)  Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
(9)  Promote signs which are compatible with their surroundings; 
(10)  Insure proper maintenance, for safety and structural soundness, as well as appearance and attractiveness of signs. 
(b)  Inasmuch as it is generally inappropriate for government to determine the content of expression that will be allowed on signs, particularly in regard to non-commercial signs, it is the intent of the city commission that this chapter be enforced such that signs carrying non-commercial messages be approved, disapproved and regulated entirely without regard to the content to be posted on the sign.

Sec. 23-26-19. - Decisions involving constitutional challenges. 
In ruling on any rezoning in which the applicant has brought a constitutional challenge to the existing zoning classification, the governing body shall pay particular attention to the following criteria which have been applied by state courts in zoning matters: 
(1)  Existing uses and zoning of the subject and nearby property; 
(2)  The extent to which property values are diminished by the particular zoning restrictions; 
(3)  The extent to which the destruction of property values, if any, promotes the healthy, safety, morals or general welfare of the public; 
(4)  The relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship, if any, imposed upon the individual property owner; 
(5)  The suitability of subject property for zoned purposes; 
(6)  The length of time the property, if vacant, has been vacant as zoned considered in the context of land development in the areas and the vicinity of the property. 
The existing zoning classification shall be considered presumptively valid and it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to present evidence that rebuts this presumption. If the governing body determines, from the evidence presented, that the existing zoning classification is unduly burdensome to the applicant and is not offset by the considerations of the public's health, safety, morals and general welfare, and considerations of the integrity of this Code and of the official zoning map, the governing body may impose upon said property any appropriate zoning classification, including conditions, which might be consistent with these considerations, the Comprehensive Plan, and the criteria described in this chapter.

DIVISION 4. - TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS 

Sec. 23-26-35. - Purpose and intent. 
Understanding the demands placed on the community's transportation network by development is an important dimension of assessing the overall impacts of development proposals. All development generates traffic, and it may generate enough traffic to create congestion and thus require the community to invest more capital funds into the transportation network in the form of new roads, traffic signals, and intersection improvements. Traffic congestion results in a number of problems, including economic costs due to delayed travel times, air pollution and accidents. A traffic impact analysis is a mechanism for the city to foresee the demands a development proposal will place on the transportation network. 
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018) 
Sec. 23-26-36. - Objectives. 
The city finds that requiring a traffic impact analysis for proposed developments that meet certain thresholds will help to achieve the following objectives: 
(a)  Forecast additional traffic associated with new development, based on accepted practices. 
(b)  Determine the improvements that are necessary to accommodate the new development. 
(c)  Allow the city to assess the impacts that a proposed development may have and assist the city in making decisions regarding development proposals. 
(d)  Help to ensure safe and reasonable traffic conditions on streets after the development is complete. 
(e)  Reduce the negative impacts created by developments by helping to ensure that the transportation network can accommodate the development. 
(f)  Protect the substantial public investment in the street system. 
(g)  Provide information relevant to citywide comprehensive planning, transportation planning, transit planning, and the provision of programs and facilities for traffic safety, road improvements, transportation demand management, pedestrian access, and other transportation system considerations. 
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018) 
Sec. 23-26-37. - Definitions. 
City engineer: The City Engineer of the City of Brunswick, or his or her designee. 
Discretionary development proposal: Any application for a rezoning, preliminary plat, conditional use permit, final design plan approval, or certificate of appropriateness. For purposes of this Code, a determination of applicability shall be made at the first discretionary development proposal encountered. 
Horizon year: Unless otherwise specified or approved by the city engineer, the horizon year shall be 20 years into the future from the year during which a traffic impact study is being prepared. 
Internal trips: Trips that are made within a multi-use or mixed-use development, by vehicle or by an alternate mode such as walking. 
Level of service (LOS): A quantitative and qualitative measure of how well traffic flows on a given street or highway. Level of service relates to such factors as highway width, number of lanes, percentage of trucks, total traffic volume, turning movements, lateral clearances, grades, sight distance, capacity in relation to volume, travel speed, and other factors which affect the quality of flow. Level of service is typically summarized by letter grades described as follows: 
Level "A" is a condition with low traffic volumes, high speeds, and free-flow conditions. 
Level "B" is a condition with light traffic volumes, minor speed restrictions, and stable flow. 
Level "C" is a condition with moderate traffic volumes, where speed and maneuvering are restricted to a limited degree by the amount of traffic. 
Level "D" is a condition with heavy traffic operating at tolerable speeds, although temporary slowdowns in flow may occur. 
Level "E" is a condition of very heavy flow and relatively low speeds. Under Level "E" the traffic is unstable and short stoppage may occur. 
Level "F" is a condition of extremely heavy flow, with frequent stoppage and very slow speeds. It is an unstable traffic condition under which traffic often comes to a complete halt. 
New trips: Total vehicle trips, minus pass-by trips, minus internal trips if applicable. 
PDC director: The director of planning, development and codes for the City of Brunswick, or his or her designee. 
Pass-by trips: Vehicle trips which are made by traffic already using the adjacent roadway and entering the site as an intermediate stop on the way to another destination. 
Peak hour: 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. daily. 
Peak-hour trip generation study: A study by a qualified professional of one or more actual developments of similar land use and development characteristics which provides empirical data on the actual number of trips entering and exiting said development(s) during the a.m. and p.m. peak hour. A peak-hour trip generation study shall consist of a.m. and p.m. peak hour traffic counts by direction (entering and exiting) on at least three separate weekdays if the study is based on only one similar development, or at least one a.m. and p.m. traffic count for three different actual developments. The results of actual traffic counts from peak-hour trip generation studies may be adjusted to discount pass-by trips as provided in this chapter. 
Professionally accepted: Published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers; or prepared by a qualified professional under work supervised by the City or Glynn County, or prepared by a qualified professional and accepted by the city engineer. 
Qualified professional: For purposes of conducting traffic impact analyses as may be required by this chapter, a qualified professional shall mean a registered professional engineer with experience in traffic engineering. For purposes of conducting peak hour trip generation studies, a qualified professional shall mean a registered professional engineer with experience in traffic engineering, or another professional approved by the city engineer based on education and experience to conduct such trip generation studies. 
Traffic impact analysis: A study, conducted by a qualified professional, which assesses the effects that a discretionary development proposal's traffic will have on the transportation network in a community or portion thereof. Traffic impact studies vary in their range of detail and complexity depending on the type, size, and location of the proposed development. 
Trip: A single or one-directional travel movement with either the origin or destination of the trip inside the study site. 
Trip generation: An estimate of the number of vehicle trips that will be generated due to the new development, which is calculated based on the type and amount of land uses in the proposed development and professionally accepted trip generation rates for each such land use. Trip generation may be expressed on an average daily basis or average peak hour (a.m., p.m.), or both. 
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018) 
Sec. 23-26-38. - Thresholds of applicability. 
A traffic impact study shall be required for any discretionary development proposal which can be reasonably expected to generate 1,000 vehicle trip ends during a single day and/or more than 100 vehicle trips during the morning or afternoon peak hours, as determined by professionally acceptable information as provided in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018) 
Sec. 23-26-39. - Exemptions. 
(a)  A traffic impact analysis is not required if a discretionary development proposal is initiated by the governing body or the planning and appeals commission. 
(b)  A discretionary development proposal may be exempted from the traffic impact study requirement by the city engineer if a prior traffic impact study for the subject property has been submitted to the city or is available from Glynn County and the proposed development is substantially similar to that for which the prior traffic impact study was conducted. 
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018) 
Sec. 23-26-40. - Trip generation data. 
The source for trip generation rates for the purposes of this Code shall be "Trip Generation" published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), most recent edition, unless otherwise approved by the city engineer.

(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018) 
Sec. 23-26-41. - Determination of applicability. 
At the time a discretionary development proposal is filed, or during any pre-application meeting if possible, the PDC Director shall determine whether a traffic impact analysis shall be required according to this chapter. The PDC director shall calculate the expected trip generation of the proposed development using professionally accepted trip generation rates or other data and compare it to the thresholds specified in this chapter to determine whether a traffic impact analysis is required. The city engineer shall assist in this effort by providing the director with any updated information available on trip generation rates. 
Applicants for discretionary development proposals shall provide sufficient information about the development proposal (e.g., number of dwelling units, square footage of buildings, number of employees, land area of the development, etc.) for the PDC director to apply professionally accepted trip generation rates to the proposed development. The director shall not accept a discretionary development proposal for processing unless it contains the data on the proposed development necessary to apply available trip generation rates. Further, no application for a discretionary development proposal shall be accepted nor advertised for a public hearing until such time as the transportation impact study, if required, has been completed and submitted in accordance with this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018) 
Sec. 23-26-42. - Cases where data are not available. 
In the event that information submitted by the applicant of the discretionary development proposal is sufficient to calculate the trip generation that would be expected to result from the proposed development, but trip generation rates or other data are not available or in sufficient quantity of studies to make a determination of applicability under the terms of this chapter, this section shall apply. 
(a)  The director shall first consult with the city engineer to determine if: 
(1)  Professionally acceptable trip generation rates applicable to the subject development exist from other reputable sources, such as the Journal of the Institute of Transportation Engineers; 
(2)  Other trip generation studies of similar developments are available; or 
(3)  Professionally acceptable trip generation rates for one or more similar land uses can be used in making the determination of applicability. 
If the city engineer is able to provide such information and determines it is professionally reputable, then the director shall use said data as may be interpreted by the city engineer to make the determination of applicability. The director and city engineer shall have no more than ten working days to comply with the provisions of this section, when it applies. 
(b)  In the event the director is unable to make a determination of applicability after consulting with the city engineer pursuant to this section, the director shall notify the proposed applicant in writing that professionally accepted trip generation rates are not available for purposes of making a determination of applicability. 
(c)  Upon receipt of notice described in this section, the applicant for a discretionary development proposal shall have 30 days to have a qualified professional prepare and submit a peak-hour trip generation study as defined by this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018) 
Sec. 23-26-43. - Specifications for peak-hour trip generation studies. 
(a)  Discounting of pass-by trips. The peak-hour trip generation study may subtract from the empirical data on actual vehicle trips those trips that are reasonably considered to be "pass-by" trips as defined by this chapter, using professionally accepted assumptions about the percent of pass-by trips approved by the city engineer. 
(b)  Reduction for internal trips in multi-use or mixed use developments. In calculating the new trips generated from a proposed development containing multiple uses or mixed uses, a qualified professional with the approval of the city engineer may apply a percentage reduction to the total vehicle trips shown in any peak hour trip generation study to account for internal trips, as defined in this chapter, so as to account for (discount) the number of internal trips reasonably expected to occur in such multi-use or mixed use development. Said reduction shall not exceed 24 percent of total trips generated. 
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018) 
Sec. 23-26-44. - Scoping meeting.

DIVISION 5. - DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONAL IMPACT 

Sec. 23-26-52. - Definitions. 
Initial DRI information form: A form intended to identify basic information about a proposed development of regional impact on which a local government is being requested to take action, and which provides information to the regional commission (RC). This form notifies the RC of a potential development of regional impact in order for the RC to meet its responsibilities within the DRI review process. 
DRI review initiation request form: A form intended to provide additional information about the proposed project to the regional commission (RC), the submission of which serves as an official request that the DRI review process be started by the RC. 
Regional development center: The coastal regional center. 
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018) 
Sec. 23-26-53. - Applicability. 
This chapter shall apply when an applicant (industry, business, or developer) requests some type of local government action related to a project, such as, but not limited to, a request for a zoning change or conditional use, zoning variance, permit, hookup to a water or sewer system, master or site plan approval, or entering into a contract, and it appears that the proposed development (or, for multi-phased projects, the complete development) meets the threshold(s) of a development of regional impact, according to "Rules of Georgia Department of Community Affairs, Chapter 110-12-3, Developments of Regional Impact, Effective July 1, 2001," as may be amended from time to time. 
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018) 
Sec. 23-26-54. - Jurisdiction. 
If a proposed development project is to be located in more than one jurisdiction and, in total, the proposed development meets or exceeds a DRI threshold, the local government in which the largest portion of the project is to be located is responsible for initiating the DRI review process. 
(Ord. No. 1055, § 3(Exh. A), 3-21-2018) 
Sec. 23-26-55. - Procedures. 
The application procedures established in chapter XX-2 and chapter XX-3 will be modified by this chapter in cases where a rezoning or conditional use permit application, or an annexation application respectively, fits the definition of a "development of regional impact." Developments of regional impact will be processed according to procedures of the State Department of Community Affairs as described in "Rules of Georgia Department of Community Affairs, Chapter 110-12-3, Developments of Regional Impact, effective July 1, 2001," as may be amended from time to time. 
When an application is received for development that meets or exceeds the thresholds established for that development type and thus constitutes a "development of regional impact" according to the aforementioned rules of the state department of community affairs, the city will follow the procedures identified in said administrative rules which are summarized here. 
When an application for a development of regional impact is received, the PDC director or city engineer, on behalf of the city, will complete an "initial DRI information" form and a "DRI review initiation request" form. Each of these two forms may be submitted to the regional commission simultaneously, provided the city has all necessary project-related information. 
The city shall not take any official legislative or administrative action to advance or further a DRI project until the review process identified under the DRI review procedure specified in "Rules of Georgia Department of Community Affairs, Chapter 110-12-3, Developments of Regional Impact, Effective July 1, 2001," as may be amended from time to time, is completed. The city may undertake preliminary staff administrative functions associated with a proposed DRI including, but not limited to, project evaluation/assessment, site visits, and placing consideration of the application on a future agenda for formal action, if required. The city shall not take any official action related to such a project until the DRI review process is completed and the city has had adequate time to consider the DRI review comments. 
After the DRI review process is completed, the city may proceed with whatever action it deems appropriate regarding the proposed project, although it is encouraged to take the public finding and additional comments into consideration as it makes its decision. 
If the project receives a negative public finding from the regional commission and the city approves said project or takes action to advance said project, the city shall notify the regional commission and the state department of community affairs of its action and identify all local requirements it has placed on the development that could mitigate any negative findings identified in the DRI review process.

ADDENDUM 
ZONING STANDARDS AND  POLICIES AND PROCEDURES  FOR ZONING HEARINGS 
Approved by the Commission  City of Brunswick, Georgia  April 5, 1989 
Part I. Standards 
In a landmark zoning decision, the Supreme Court of Georgia wrote: 
As the individual's right to the unfettered use of his property confronts the police power under which zoning is done, the balance the law strikes is that a zoning classification may only be justified if it bears a substantial relation to the public health, safety, morality or general welfare. Lacking such justification, the zoning may be set aside as arbitrary or unreasonable. . . As these critical interests are balanced, if the zoning regulation results in relatively little gain or benefit to the public while inflicting serious injury or loss on the owner, such regulation is confiscatory and void. . . Moreover, we specifically rule that for such unlawful confiscation to occur requiring that the zoning be voided, it is not necessary that the property be totally useless for the purposes classified. . . It suffices to void it that the damage to the owner is significant and is not justified by the benefit to the public. Barrett v. Hamby, 235 Ga. 262, 265; 219 S.E.2d 399 (1975) 
The foregoing means that a zoning classification, to be valid, must be supported by reasons related to the public health, safety, morality or general welfare. Specific criteria for zoning decisions do not exist, but the reasons upon which such decisions are based must be identifiable and articulable, in order to avoid the fatal defect of arbitrariness. 
In a later decision the Court suggested a number of factors which should be considered in determining the validity of a zoning classification: 
The validity of each zoning ordinance must be determined on the facts applicable to the particular case, but certain general lines of inquiry have been regarded as relevant, to wit: (1) existing uses and zoning of nearby property; (2) the extent to which property values are diminished by the particular zoning restrictions; (3) the extent to which the destruction of property values of the plaintiffs promotes the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public; (4) the relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship imposed upon the individual property owner; (5) the suitability of the subject property for the zoned purposes; and (6) the length of time the property has been vacant as zoned, considered in the context of land development in the area in the vicinity of the property. Guhl v. Holcomb Bridge Road Corp., 238 Ga. 322, 323; 232 S.E.2d 830 (1977) 
The current Georgia statutory law, O.C.G.A. § 36-66-5(b) expressly mandates that each local government exercising zoning power establish and consider such factors in the form of substantive standards for zoning decisions. That subsection provides: 
[E]ach local government shall adopt standards governing the exercise of the zoning power, and such standards may include any factors which the local government finds relevant in balancing the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare against the right to the unrestricted use of property. Such standards shall be printed and copies thereof shall be available for distribution to the general public. 
In keeping with the foregoing statutory requirement, the City of Brunswick has adopted the following substantive standards to govern its zoning decisions: 
A. A PROPOSED ZONING CLASSIFICATION OR CONDITIONAL USE REQUEST SHOULD BE COMPATIBLE WITH EXISTING USES AND ZONING OF ADJACENT AND NEARBY PROPERTY, AND ``SPOT ZONING'' SHOULD ALMOST ALWAYS BE REJECTED. 
Relevant Questions 
(1)  Would the proposed rezoning create an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts? 
(2)  Is the proposed rezoning a logical extension of a zoning boundary which would improve the pattern of uses in the general area? 
B. A PROPOSED ZONING CLASSIFICATION SHOULD NOT DESTABILIZE THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD. 
Relevant Questions 
(1)  Is the proposed zoning classification one which would promote integrity of the neighborhood and preserve its general character? 
(2)  Would the proposed rezoning precipitate similar rezoning requests which would generate or accelerate adverse land use changes in the neighborhood? 
C. A PROPOSED ZONING CLASSIFICATION SHOULD MAXIMIZE THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY WITHOUT DEPRECIATING THE VALUE OF ADJACENT AND NEARBY PROPERTY. 
Relevant Questions 
(1)  To what extent does the existing zoning classification depress the value of the subject property? 
(2)  To what extent would the proposed zoning classification result in appreciation of the value of the property? 
(3)  What effect does the existing zoning classification have on the values of adjacent and nearby property? 
(4)  What effect would the proposed zoning classification have on the values of adjacent and nearby property? 
D. A PROPOSED ZONING CLASSIFICATION SHOULD NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON TRAFFIC FLOW, TRAFFIC SAFETY OR POPULATION DENSITY. 
Relevant Questions 
(1)  Is there adequate public or private parking for the proposed use and other uses permitted within the classification? 
(2)  Would such uses create any problem of traffic congestion in the area? 
(3)  Would such uses create any traffic safety problem with regard to ingress and egress, visibility or otherwise? 
(4)  Would such uses necessitate changes in streets or sidewalks or traffic signage or signalization? 
(5)  Would such uses contribute to an undesirable level of population density? 
(6)  Would such uses substantially conflict with existing density patterns in the neighborhood? 
E. A PROPOSED ZONING CLASSIFICATION SHOULD NOT HAVE ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. 
Relevant Questions 
(1)  Would the proposed use or other uses permitted within the classification create noise, dust, smoke or odors? 
(2)  Would such uses affect air quality or water quality and quantity? 
(3)  Would such uses create problems with drainage or soil erosion and sedimentation? 
(4)  Would such uses aggravate problems with flood damage control? 
(5)  Would such uses aggravate waste disposal problems? 
F. A PROPOSED ZONING CLASSIFICATION SHOULD NOT HAVE ADVERSE AESTHETIC EFFECTS. 
Relevant Questions 
(1)  Would the proposed rezoning lead to removal of existing vegetation? 
(2)  Would the proposed use incorporate new planting? 
(3)  Would the proposed use necessitate unattractive structures or result in removal or alteration of historic structures? 
(4)  Would the proposed use be visually compatible with the surrounding neighborhood? 
(5)  Would the proposed use include machinery or work visible from the street or neighboring property? 
(6)  Would the proposed use be adequately separated from conflicting uses by an appropriate buffer? 
G. A REZONING SHOULD NOT RESULT IN COSTS TO THE PUBLIC DISPROPORTIONATE TO TAX REVENUES GENERATED BY THE PROPOSED USE. 
Relevant Questions 
(1)  Would the rezoning increase the cost of government in providing public utilities, schools, streets, police and fire protection, etc.? 
(2)  What additional public facilities would be required? 
(3)  To what extent would such increased costs be offset by increased tax revenues? 
H. THE SUBJECT PROPERTY SHOULD BE SUITABLE FOR THE ZONED PURPOSES. 
Relevant Questions 
(1)  Is the property suitable for uses within the existing zoning classification? 
(2)  Has the property been vacant as zoned, and if so, for what period or periods of time? 
(3)  Are there substantial reasons why the property cannot be economically used in accordance with existing zoning? 
(4)  Would the proposed rezoning benefit the general public in any way? 
(5)  Would the proposed rezoning conform to or diverge from the comprehensive land use plan? 
* * * 
It is obvious that the foregoing standards are very general, not at all specific, and that the public and private interests cannot be balanced with mathematical certainty in a zoning decision. Moreover, particular zoning issues which may arise, considered in context, may suggest concerns in addition to the foregoing standards and further questions which will need to be addressed by the Commission. It can only be said that any zoning decision, to be lawful, must be based on a relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship imposed upon private parties. Such decisions must never be based simply upon the numbers of supporters or opponents or other political factors without consideration of the standards. 
Part II. Hearing Policies 
The Georgia statutory law, O.C.G.A. § 36-66-5(a) provides: 
Local governments shall adopt policies and procedures which govern calling and conducting hearings [on proposed zoning decisions]. . . and printed copies of such policies and procedures shall be available for distribution to the public. 
In keeping with the foregoing statutory requirement, the City of Brunswick has adopted the following policies and procedures to govern calling and conducting hearings on proposed zoning decisions: 
1.  All public hearings on proposed zoning decisions shall be held in the Council Room in Brunswick City Hall. 
2.  Hearings may be held at either the regular morning meetings of the City Commission—that is, on the first Wednesday of each month at 8:30 A.M.—or at the regular evening meetings of the Commission—that is, on the third Wednesday of each month at 6:30 P.M. It is generally preferred that public hearings be held at the evening meetings in order to afford more convenient public participation. 
3.  Where the hearing is related to a proposed amendment initiated by the Commission, the Commission shall determine the time for the hearing and shall cause publication of the notice required by law. 
4.  Where the hearing is related to an application for rezoning initiated by a property owner or property owners, the Planning Staff of the City of Brunswick Department of Community Development shall establish an appropriate time for the hearing and shall be responsible for giving the notice required by law. 
5.  Such hearings shall be chaired by the Mayor, or in his absence, by the Mayor Pro Tem. 
6.  Upon opening the hearing, the presiding officer shall determine the number and identity of attendees who wish to speak in support of or opposition to the proposed zoning decision. 
7.  The presiding officer may then impose a reasonable time limit upon the individual speakers in attendance, which shall apply equally to all; provided, however, that an applicant for rezoning shall be given adequate time to present his argument. 
8.  Next in order, the presiding officer shall call for the recommendation of the Planning Staff and the reasons upon which the recommendation is based. 
9.  Following the presentation of the staff recommendation, the presiding officer shall call upon an applicant for rezoning, if any, or his representative to present his case. 
10.  The presiding officer shall then allow other citizens present to speak in support of the proposed zoning decision. 
11.  The presiding officer shall then allow other citizens present to speak in opposition to the proposed zoning decision. 
12.  The presiding officer shall then allow an applicant or his representative a brief opportunity for rebuttal, following which there shall be no further comment on the application from the audience. 
13.  The presiding officer shall then open the floor for discussion of the issues among the members of the City Commission and shall direct the discussion to a consideration of the standards set forth in Part I hereinabove. 
14.  As part of its decision the Commission shall show that the decision is not based on the numbers of supporters or opponents or other personal or political considerations. 
15.  The minutes of the hearing shall reflect the specific reasons for the decision of the City Commission.

(e)  Fees. Upon declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor or the mayor, the city may temporarily reduce or suspend any permit fees, application fees or other rate structures as necessary to encourage the rebuilding of the areas impacted by the disaster or emergency.

Section 605. - Certificate of Tentative Approval.

(Ord. No. 1055, § 4, 3-21-2018) 
Section 606. - Effect of Tentative Approval of Preliminary Plat. 
Approval of a preliminary plat by the Planning Commission constitutes tentative approval of the subdivision as to the character and intensity of development, general layout, and the appropriate dimensions of streets, lots, and other planned features. Such tentative approval binds the subdivider to proceed with the preparation of a final plat and the installation of site improvements, subject to obtaining other necessary permits. 
Approval of a preliminary plat does not constitute approval of a final plat, and accordingly, does not authorize the sale of lots or the recording of a preliminary plat. 
Section 607. - Revocation of Tentative Approval. 
The tentative approval of a preliminary plat or any time extension thereof, may be revoked upon written notice after due public notice and hearing by the Planning Commission, where the Planning Commission feels that a material change in conditions has occurred affecting the proposed subdivision, including new information regarding the physical conditions of the site or proposed public works, which would adversely affect to a substantial degree public health, safety or welfare. 
Section 608. - Preliminary Plat Time Limitation. 
A subdivider may, within one (1) year from the date of tentative approval of a preliminary plat, submit a formal application for the approval of a final plat, as specified in Section 700. 
If a subdivider does not submit a final plat application within the one-year period and has not received an extension of time by the Planning Commission, as provided in Section 609, the tentative approval of the Planning Commission is voided. 
Section 609. - Preliminary Plat Time Extension. 
Before expiration of the allowed one-year period for filing a final plat application, a subdivider may request in writing an extension of time. Where the Planning Commission finds sufficient reason, it may grant one or more six-month extensions. The decision to grant an extension shall be communicated to the subdivider in writing on or before the original expiration date. 
When the Planning Commission has granted an extension of time, it must, prior to the review of a final plat application, determine whether the conditions on which the tentative approval of a preliminary plat was based have been substantially changed and, if so, the Planning Commission shall require the necessary changes in the preliminary plat to reflect these changed conditions. 
ARTICLE VII. - FINAL PLAT PROCEDURE 

Section 700. - Final Plat Application.

ARTICLE VIII. - DEDICATIONS AND RESERVATIONS 

Section 800. - Improvements. 
The final responsibility for the installation of the improvements required by this Ordinance at the standards imposed rests with the subdivider. Upon proper installation of these improvements, the subdivider shall take the final steps to dedicate the improvements and have them accepted by the City Commission. 
Section 801. - Effect of Recording. 
Recording the approved final plat constitutes a dedication of all public roads to public use, a dedication of all neighborhood parks and other public areas to public use, and a reservation for possible future public acquisition of such additional areas as may be required by the Planning Commission or the City Commission. 
Section 802. - Effect of Offers of Dedication. 
The offer to dedicate roads, parks or other areas or portions of them, does not impose any obligation upon the City Commission concerning maintenance or improvements until the City Commission has made actual appropriation by ordinance, by entry, or by improvement. 
If land is dedicated for public use and such use is not imminent, the subdivider may be permitted to dedicate the land with the privilege of using the surface rights until the City Commission is ready to use the land. Such dedication with the temporary privilege of use shall be noted on the final plat. 
Section 803. - Effect of Land Reservation. 
On sites reserved for eventual public acquisition, no building development is permitted during the period of reservation. The Planning Commission may require the reservation of such sites in addition to land to be dedicated for public use. The reservation period shall not be longer than eighteen (18) months, unless with the consent of the subdivider. Land reserved for public acquisition, along with the period of reservation, shall be indicated on the final plat. 
Section 804. - Dedication of Local Recreation Sites. 
Where a proposed park, playground, open space, or other local or neighborhood recreation site is shown on the Comprehensive Plan, or where the Planning Commission considers that a local recreation site is necessary to carry out the purpose of these regulations, the Planning Commission may require the dedication of all or a portion of such site in accordance with the following standards: 
(A)  The land to be dedicated shall be of suitable size, dimensions, topography, access, and general character for the proposed use; and 
(B)  The amount of land so required for this purpose shall not be less than five percent (5%) of the total area of the subdivision. 
Section 805. - Fee In Lieu of Required Dedication. 
Where the area required for dedication for recreation or open space use would result in a site too small to be usable, or if the Comprehensive Plan calls for such local recreation site to be located elsewhere, or if a suitable local recreation site cannot be properly located in the subdivision, as determined by the Planning Commission, a payment of a fee in lieu of dedication of such land is required. The following procedure shall be followed: 
(A)  The amount of the fee shall be substantially equal to the value of the land that would be set aside if the standards specified in Section 804 were to be applied; 
(B)  The fee shall be paid to the City of Brunswick, Georgia, prior to the approval of the final plat; and 
(C)  All money paid to the City in this manner shall be kept in a special capital reserve fund and shall be used only for the acquisition of land for recreation and open space purposes. 
Section 806. - Alternative Method of Providing Local Recreation Sites. 
In lieu of requiring the dedication of a recreation site, or a fee for this purpose, the Planning Commission may permit a private site to be used under the following conditions: 
(A)  If in the judgment of the Planning Commission the purposes of this Ordinance regarding recreation and open space land will be accomplished; and 
(B)  If the private site is permanently devoted to recreation use and adequately secured for such use by proper deed covenants or other private restrictions. 
Section 807. - Drainageways. 
Where a subdivision is traversed by a water course, stream, channel, or other drainageway, the subdivider shall provide a drainage easement conforming substantially with the line of the drainageway. The easement shall be of a width adequate to preserve the unimpeded flow of natural drainage, to allow for the widening, deepening, relocation, improvement, or protection of the drainageway, and to allow installation of a storm water sewer. 
Any change in an existing drainageway must first be approved by the City Engineer.

For reasons of protecting present sources of water supply and safeguarding the health of the public from possible contamination by improper methods of sewage disposal, the Planning Commission will approve on-site, subsurface sewage disposal systems only when the feasibility study indicates the following: 
(A)  Justification of the project necessitates consideration of this method; 
(B)  The soil absorption is satisfactory; and 
(C)  On-site disposal will not endanger ground water supplies below the level of the absorption system. 
1400.7 Percolation Tests. In the event it is necessary to install on-site subsurface sewage disposal systems, soil absorption and water table determination tests shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of the County Health Officials. 
Section 1401. - Water Supply Requirements. 
Based on the results of the feasibility report required in Section 1400, the subdivider shall be required to either install or have installed by the appropriate agency an adequate, approved water supply system as follows: 
1401.1 Existing System. Where there is an existing public water supply system on or near the proposed subdivision, a complete water main supply system connected to the existing public water supply system is required. 
1401.2 Separate Community System. Where there is no existing public water supply system on or near the subdivision, a separate community water supply system approved by the City Engineer and the County Health Officials may be required, along with satisfactory provision for its future maintenance. 
1401.3 Individual Lot Supply. Where there is no existing public water supply system available and a separate community water supply system is not feasible, each lot in a subdivision must be provided with an individual water supply system in accordance with the requirements of the County Health Officials. 
1401.4 Fire Hydrants. Fire hydrants must be installed as an integral part of any public water supply system, in accordance with the requirements of the City Engineer and the State Fire Marshal. 
Section 1402. - Sanitary Sewerage Requirements. 
Based on the results of the feasibility report required in Section 1400, the subdivider shall be required to either install or have installed by the appropriate agency an adequate, approved sanitary sewerage disposal system as follows: 
1402.1 Existing System. Where there is an existing public sanitary sewer system on or near the subdivision, a complete sanitary sewage disposal system must be installed and connected to the existing system. 
1402.2 Planned Public System. Where there is no existing public sanitary sewer system on or near the subdivision, but a public sanitary sewer is to be installed on or near the subdivision within a reasonable time, as determined by the Planning Commission, a complete sanitary sewage collection system must be installed and 
(A)  Connected to a community treatment facility until such time as the planned public sanitary sewer system is complete and adequate connection is provided thereto; or 
(B)  Capped, and on-site subsurface sewage disposal systems provided, if it is determined that a temporary community treatment facility is not feasible. 
1402.3 Separate Community System. Where there is no existing public sanitary sewer system, a separate community sanitary sewer system and treatment facility are required, if possible. Separate community sewerage facilities must be installed in accordance with the requirements of the City Engineer, the County Health Officials, and the State Health Officials, and must receive their written approval. Satisfactory provision must be made to insure future maintenance of the separate community system. 
1402.4 On-Site Disposal. Where there is no existing public sanitary sewer system and a community sanitary sewer system and treatment facility are not feasible, on-site subsurface sewage disposal systems shall be installed on individual lots in accordance with the requirements of the City Engineer, the County Health Officials, and the State Health Officials. An appropriate County Health Department official must inspect and approve each private on-site disposal system. 
1402.5 Connection Prior to Development. If it is determined by the County Health Officials or the State Health Officials that on-site subsurface sewage disposal systems are not feasible, connections to an approved public or community sanitary sewer system must be made prior to the development of the subdivision. 
1402.6 Sewer Pipe. All sewer mains must be at least eight (8") inches in diameter and all sewer laterals must be at least four (4") inches and stubbed out to the road right-of-way lines. Sanitary sewers shall not be used as storm sewers. 
Section 1403. - Storm Drainage Requirements. 
Storm sewers and other related facilities which comprise complete storm drainage system shall be designed and installed in accordance with City standards in each subdivision as necessary to permit the unimpeded flow of natural water courses, to insure the drainage of all low points along the line of roads, and to intercept storm-water runoff along roads. In addition, storm sewers and other related facilities shall be designed not only for the anticipated peak discharge from the property being subdivided, but also for the anticipated run-off that will occur when all other property in the drainage area is fully developed. 
1403.1 Responsibility of Subdivider. The subdivider shall be responsible for installing, at his own expense, all improvements necessary to provide proper drainage for his property and to tie the drainage system of the subdivision into the existing City drainage system. All drainage improvements must be completed and approved by the City Engineer prior to the development of the subdivision. 
1403.2 Abutting Properties. In the design of storm sewers and other related facilities, special consideration shall be given to preventing excess run-off onto adjacent developed or undeveloped land. When a storm drainage outlet will abut another property, the subdivider should secure the approval, in writing, of the adjoining affected owners. 
1403.3 Storm Water Drainage from Roads. A road must be designed so as to provide for the discharge of surface water from its right-of-way. The slope of the crown of a road shall not be less than one-eighth ( 1/8 ) of an inch per foot. Adequate facilities must exist along all roads to properly intercept and carry away storm water drainage. 
Section 1404. - Utility Easements. 
When easements are required in the design of a subdivision, they must be a minimum of ten (10) feet wide and, to the fullest extent possible, be adjacent to, or centered on, rear or side lot lines. All easements shall be designed in accordance with City standards. 
Every effort should be made in new subdivisions to install electric and telephone facilities underground and/or along rear lot lines, whenever possible. 
When a subdivision is traversed by a water course, drainage way, channel, or stream there shall be provided a storm-water or drainage easement of adequate width. Parallel streets may be required by the Planning Commission on either side of such easements where necessary to facilitate both drainage and circulation. 
Section 1405. - Utility System Plans. 
The plans for the installation of a water supply system, a sanitary sewer system, and a storm drainage system must be prepared by a registered professional engineer. Such plans shall be prepared with the cooperation and approval of the appropriate utility agency, the City Engineer, the County Health Officials, and the State Health Officials. Upon completion of the water, sewer, and storm drainage systems, copies of the plans as built and approved shall be filed with both the Planning Commission and the City Commission.
