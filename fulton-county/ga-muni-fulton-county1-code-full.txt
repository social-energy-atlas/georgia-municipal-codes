PREFACE OF THE COUNTY ATTORNEY 
The Code of Laws of Fulton County is a unique assemblage of state laws of local and general application, provisions of the Constitution of the State of Georgia relating to counties and Fulton County Ordinances and Resolutions, which together not only define the jurisdiction and authority of Fulton County elected and appointed officials, but reflect policies and procedures adopted by the Board of Commissioners of Fulton County. While both ordinances and resolutions are adopted by the Board of Commissioners of Fulton County, violations of ordinances are considered misdemeanors. Resolutions, however, establish policy and offer directives to Fulton County employees. 
The County Attorney has attempted to include all provisions of the Constitution of the State of Georgia, state and local laws, ordinances and resolutions which relate to matters of public concern and/or matters of frequent inquiry about Fulton County and to organize these provisions in a manner that is logical and easy to follow. In addition, for the first time, the Code of Laws contains Appendices which set forth in their entirety certain regulations which heretofore have been separately codified, so as to allow for more easy reference to these regulations. 
It must be noted that the laws, ordinances, resolutions and regulations which are contained in the Code of Laws are current as of the date of this codification. The reader is advised to shepardize the constitutional and state law provisions to ensure that there have been no amendments or repeals. With respect to the Code of Ordinances and Code of Resolutions, the reader should contact the Clerk to the Board of Commissioners of Fulton County to ensure that the ordinances and resolutions remain in full force and effect. 
A special thanks is due to the Board of Commissioners of Fulton County for their initiative and funding in this endeavor. Acknowledgment is made with appreciation for the cooperation and assistance of Ms. Justine Boyd, Clerk to the Board of Commissioners, and her assistant, Mr. Charles Downey. Appreciation is offered to the members of the County Attorney's staff in drafting the original resolutions and ordinances, and particularly to Ms. Viviane Haight for assistance in assembling the legislation to be included in this Code of Laws. 

 
PUBLISHER'S PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent legislation of Fulton County, Georgia. Part I is a compilation of local acts and constitutional amendments deemed advisable to be included. (The user is cautioned that portions of acts (or in some cases, entire acts) may be obsolete). Part II consists of subparts A and B. Subpart A is a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the county. Subpart B is a codification of resolutions that appear to be of general interest. In the preparation of part II, the style of the legislation has been ignored so that material that is penal in nature has been classified as an ordinance and material that is not penal has been classified as a resolution. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1983 Code, as supplemented through May 4, 1988, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1983 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent legislation included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Susan B. Forsling, County Attorney, Ms. Viviane M. Haight, Senior Assistant Staff Counsel, Ms. Justine Boyd, Clerk to the Board of Commissioners, and Mr. Charles Downey, Administrative Operations Analyst, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

PART I - LOCAL CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS AND LOCAL ACTS[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note— This part is a compilation of local acts not found in the Official Code of Georgia Annotated and local amendments to the state constitution that were deemed advisable to be included in this Code. Local amendments to the state constitution were repealed effective July 1, 1987, unless continued by local ordinance or act prior to such date. See Ga. Const. (1983) art. XI, § I, ¶ IV. Editor's notes indicate the portion of the state constitution amended and whether the amendment was to the 1877, 1945 or 1976 constitution. 
History notes state the source of each section. Obvious misspelling and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes the same system of capitalization, citation to state statutes (including updating so as to reference the Official Code of Georgia Annotated (O.C.G.A.)) and expression of numbers in text as appears in the Code of Ordinances and Code of Resolutions has been used. Catchlines to sections have been altered or added as necessary to accurately reflect the contents of sections. The designation of subsections has been made consistent with the style used in the Code of Ordinances and Code of Resolutions. The term "act" has, if the intent is clear, been changed so as to reference the appropriate organizational unit of this Code. Internal references to acts or portions of acts in this compilation have been altered so as to reference this compilation. Enacting clauses and related language has been deleted from individual sections. Unless of special importance, effective date sections, severability sections, and repealer sections have not been included in this compilation. In addition, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-5-20, the title of the governing body is altered in local acts (but not local constitutional amendments) so as to be the board of commissioners. Except as stated in editorial notes, all other additions or changes are indicated by brackets.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL

(d)  The authority conferred on the general assembly by this amendment shall be retroactive to January 1, 1951. Any act passed after January 1, 1951, germane to the subject matter of this amendment, shall be conclusively presumed to have been passed under the authority of this amendment. It is declared that the authority conveyed to the general assembly by this amendment relates to only one general subject matter, and the general assembly is empowered, but not directed, to exercise such authority by one law pertaining to all or any one or more of said services, which law may be passed prior to the submission of this amendment to the people.

DIVISION 2. - COMPOSITION, TERMS, COMPENSATION, ETC. 

Sec. 1-70. - Board of commissioners created; bond; oath of members. 
A board of commissioners to consist of seven persons, for the County of Fulton, is hereby created. Said commissioners shall give bond in the sum of $1,000.00 each, with sufficient sureties to be approved by the probate judge, and shall take an oath before the judge of the superior court to faithfully discharge their duties. 
(1880-81 Ga. Laws (Act No. 3), page 508, § 1; 1952 Ga. Laws (Act No. 814), page 2672; 1973 Ga. Laws (Act No. 130), page 2462, § 1) 
Editor's note— The language in the above section was found in § 1-1-1 of the county's 1983 Code and is not found in such form in the acts listed in the history note for the above section. As enforcement of the 1973 act was enjoined (see Pitts v. Carter, 380 F. Supp. 4 (N.D. Ga. 1974)), the author has assumed that the language is derived from a court order related to such case. 
Sec. 1-71. - Compensation of commissioners. 
The chairperson of the board of commissioners of counties of this state having a population of 550,000 or more according to the United States decennial census of 1990, or any future such census, shall be compensated in an amount not exceeding $27,000.00 per annum. Each of the other members of any such board of commissioners shall be compensated in an amount not exceeding $25,000.00 per annum. Said compensation shall be set within the limits of this section after a public hearing in a separate resolution adopted by a recorded vote and shall be included in the county's budget after such adoption. The compensation provided for in this section shall be paid in equal monthly installments on the first day of each month out of the county treasury. This section shall not apply to any county which has an elected chief executive officer having any powers which may only be changed if approved in a special election.

Editor's note— The population brackets in the 1947 act compiled in this division were amended by 1961 Ga. Laws, page 3012. The 1961 act was repealed by 1982 Ga. Laws, page 2107, § 54(50).

The 1922 act has been repealed and no longer appears in the state code. While the 1982 act also repealed 1967 Ga. Laws (Act No. 368), page 3012, such repealer has been treated as a nullity.

When the county manager and the purchasing agent, upon written recommendation of the user department, determine that the use of competitive sealed bidding is not practicable or is not advantageous to the county, a contract may be entered into by the board of commissioners based on competitive sealed proposals, subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  This method of solicitation shall only be used after a written determination by the purchasing agent, upon recommendation by the user department and county manager, that the use of competitive sealed bidding is not practicable under the circumstances or is not in the best interests of the county in accordance with regulations promulgated by the board of commissioners. 
(2)  Proposals shall be solicited through a request for proposal. 
(3)  Adequate public notice of the request for proposal shall be given in the same manner as provided for competitive sealed bidding.

(6)  As provided in the request for proposal and under policies and procedures to be developed by the county, discussions may be conducted by the purchasing agent, in conjunction with the user department, with reasonable offerors who submit proposals determined by the purchasing agent, and written recommendation of the user department, to be reasonably qualified for being selected for award; such discussions shall be for the purpose of clarification to assure full understanding of and responsiveness to the solicitation requirements. Vendors who make offers, hereinafter referred to as offerors, shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals; and such revisions may be permitted after submission and prior to award for the purpose of obtaining best and final offers. In conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of any information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors. 
(7)  The award shall be made by the board of commissioners to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined, upon written recommendation by the county manager, the purchasing agent and the user department, to be in the best interest of the county, taking into consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal. No other factors or criteria shall be used in the evaluation. The contract file shall contain the name and complete identification of the successful offeror and the basis, in writing, upon which the award is made. 
(8)  When proposals are received from offerors pursuant to this section or when bids are received from bidders pursuant to section 2-314 of this article are unreasonable or unacceptable as to terms and conditions, or when the lowest responsible bid and offer exceeds available funds and it is determined in writing by the county manager and the purchasing agent, upon recommendations by the user department, that time or circumstances will not permit the delay required to resolicit competitive sealed bids and competitive sealed proposals, a contract may be negotiated and awarded by the board of commissioners pursuant to this section, provided that each responsible bidder or offeror who submitted a response to the original solicitation is notified of the determination and is given a reasonable opportunity to negotiate. The negotiated price shall be lower than the lowest responsible rejected bid and offer of any responsible bidder and offeror under the original solicitation, provided that the board of commissioners may reject all bids or proposals if it shall deem it in the best interest of the county to do so. 
(9)  Within five days of the award of the contract, the purchasing agent shall publish the name of the successful bidder or offeror on public display in a conspicuous place in the purchasing department so that it may be easily seen by the public. The public notice shall also show the price or amount for which the contract was let; the work, labor or service to be done; or the supplies, materials, or equipment to be furnished under the contract. All the information required to be placed on public display in a conspicuous place in the purchasing department shall also be recorded in a permanent book to be kept by the county in the purchasing department. Such permanent record shall also contain information recording the names of persons whose bids or offers were rejected. Such records shall always be subject to public inspection upon written notice to the purchasing agent and subject to a reasonable response period by the county. 
(10)  After contracts have been awarded, the purchasing agent shall certify to various user departments and agencies of the county government the sources of the work, labor, or service to be done or the supplies, materials, or equipment to be furnished by the contract. 
(11)  On all competitive sealed proposals and competitive sealed bids pursuant to section 2-314 of this article received or solicited by the county through its purchasing agent, the following certificate of independent price determination shall be signed and attached to the bid or proposal: 
"I certify that this bid or proposal is made without prior understanding, agreement or connection with any corporation, firm or person submitting a bid for the same work, labor or service to be done or the supplies, materials or equipment to be furnished and is in all respects fair and without collusion or fraud. I understand collusive bidding is a violation of state and federal law and can result in fines, prison sentences and civil damages awards. I agree to abide by all conditions of this bid or proposal and certify that I am authorized to sign this bid or proposal for the bidder."

Sec. 2-321. - Emergency procurement. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the purchasing agent, upon written recommendation by the user department and approval by the county manager, may make emergency procurement of work, labor or service to be done or the supplies, materials or equipment to be furnished when there exists a threat to public health, welfare or safety; provided, however, that such emergency procurement shall be made with such competition as is practicable under the circumstances. A written determination of the basis of the emergency and rationale for the selection of the particular contractor shall be included in the contract file. As soon as possible in such circumstances, a record of each such emergency procurement shall be made and shall set forth the contractor's name, the amount of payment and type of contract, a list of work, labor, or service to be done or the supplies, materials or equipment to be furnished under the contract, and the identification number of the contract file; and such information shall be forwarded to the board of commissioners for ratification and be made a part of the minutes of the next scheduled meeting of the board of commissioners.

In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign rents, revenue and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of the law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for with the professional assistance of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company having the powers of a trust company under the laws of this state, any other state, or the United States to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indentures may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture.

(2)  The principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due; 
(3)  The necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest; and

(a)  If the governing authority elects to authorize the courts of criminal jurisdiction in the county to assign public attorneys, each court shall prescribe the compensation of the public attorneys whom it assigns as hereinafter provided and approve the expenses necessarily incurred by them in the defense of indigents under this article. The governing authority of the county shall recommend such attorney fee limits for the several courts in the county as may be prescribed by the courts for the defense of the indigent and such investigation expense as may be necessary and approved by the court. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, however, in extraordinary circumstances the trial court may approve the payment of such additional compensation in excess of the limits stated herein as the trial court may determine and find to be necessary to provide for compensation for protracted representation.

ARTICLE III. - LEGAL AID 

Sec. 10-76. - Findings of general assembly; statement of article purpose. 
The general assembly finds that counties in this state with large populations have a large number of poor people who cannot afford legal services. The general assembly finds that without the assistance of an attorney poor people have great difficulty in civil matters in the court systems in such counties and that trained legal assistance for these people is essential for the judicial system to function adequately and fairly. The general assembly finds that the programs currently in effect to provide legal services in civil matters to poor people do not have the resources to meet the needs of all poor people and, therefore, that it is necessary to encourage and develop additional legal resources through the use of volunteer programs to help meet these needs. Because under the Code of Ethics of the legal profession volunteer legal representation of poor people is a duty of all lawyers, the general assembly finds that it is in the public interest for the general assembly to enact legislation to provide a means to develop, operate, and administer programs of volunteer legal services for poor people in such counties. 
(1979 Ga. Laws (Act No. 58), page 3131, § 1) 
Sec. 10-77. - Creation of a program of volunteer legal services to poor people. 
In all counties in this state having a population of 550,000 or more according to the 1970 United States decennial census, or any future such census, the chief judge of the state court of the county shall designate a nonprofit agency to develop, operate, and administer programs for the provision by attorneys within the county of volunteer legal services to low-income clients involved in civil matters within the jurisdiction of courts within the county. In designating such agency, the judge shall consult with the presidents of local bar associations within the county and with the directors of agencies within the county providing legal services to low-income clients in civil matters.

The agency designated pursuant to section 10-77 shall have the following duties in carrying out the provisions of this article: 
(1)  To develop, operate and administer volunteer programs among the lawyers within the county to provide legal services on a volunteer basis to low-income clients involved in civil matters within the jurisdiction of courts within the county. 
(2)  To report annually to the state court on its activities conducted pursuant to this article.

These fees shall be collected, in addition to any other fees or charges authorized by law, from the plaintiff or other moving party in each civil suit, action or proceeding for which fees are required to be paid by such party. Such fees shall be charged only once in each case and shall be charged at the time of filing of the first papers in the action. 
(b)  All fees collected pursuant to subsection (a) during each month shall be paid by the clerk or by the county to the agency designated pursuant to this section no later than the last day of the next calendar quarter after the quarter of the month in which collected. 
(c)  Fees collected pursuant to subsection (a) shall be used by the agency designated pursuant to this section only for the public and charitable purposes provided by this article. 
(d)  In connection with the annual accounting required in section 10-78(3), all fees collected pursuant to subsection (a) which have not been disbursed or committed for use in discharging the duties described in section 10-78 shall be refunded to the clerk of the state court and the clerk of the magistrate court, the amounts refunded to said clerks being proportional to the amounts received from them during the year, or to the county, and such fees shall be used as other unrestricted court costs collected by the clerk.

Sec. 26-32. - Application of article; municipalities to transfer property, buildings and facilities to countywide public library system; additional revenues to be generated by taxation. 
(a)  The provisions of this article shall apply to the City of East Point, effective January 1, 1996; provided, however, that nothing in this article shall compel the conveyance of real estate or buildings of any library presently utilized by the City of East Point, nor shall Fulton County be compelled to construct any library within the City of East Point. 
(b)  Subject to the limitations of subsection (g) of this section, after midnight June 30, 1983, all public library services and facilities in unincorporated Fulton County and within all parts of any municipality located wholly or partially within Fulton County shall be maintained, operated, and continued in existence by the countywide library system, and no municipality located wholly or partially within Fulton County may operate a public library system or facility. 
(c)  On or before July 1, 1983, each municipality located wholly or partially within Fulton County, which operates a public library service or facility, shall transfer to Fulton County for operation of the countywide library system all assets, records, employees, causes of action, rights, obligations, debts, and all other personal property used in the normal operation of the municipality's library service or facility. 
(d)  Except as otherwise provided herein, on or before July 1, 1983, each municipality located wholly or partially within Fulton County which operates a public library service or facility shall transfer to Fulton County for operation of the countywide library system the legal title to all real property with a library service or facility thereon, together with all rights and appurtenances thereto and subject to all liens and encumbrances thereon. In the event the countywide library system shall discontinue to use any real property transferred pursuant to this section for a library facility or service, the property shall be disposed of by Fulton County after a public hearing, and the proceeds of such disposal shall be used for the countywide library system. Pending disposal, however, the property may be used by the county for county purposes. 
(e)  On or before July 1, 1983, the City of Atlanta shall lease to Fulton County, for the operation of the countywide library system, the new "Central Building for the Atlanta Library System" and all other real property of the City of Atlanta Library System. During the term of said lease, lease payments on such property shall be paid by Fulton County in an amount equal to the bond debt service requirements of all property of the library system leased pursuant to this section. Upon discharge and retirement of said bonds, the City of Atlanta shall transfer legal title to all such real property of the Atlanta Library System to Fulton County. 
(f)  Notwithstanding anything contained herein, nothing shall compel conveyance of the real estate and building upon which is situated a library of the City of College Park or a library of the City of Hapeville. The Cities of College Park and Hapeville shall each retain title to the real estate and structures constituting libraries of each such city, and each such city shall by contract provide the use of such buildings and real estate by the countywide library system. 
(g)  The transfer of library facilities to the countywide library system as provided in this section, the authority to enter into the lease contract provided for by subsection (e) of this section, and the authority to enter into contracts provided for by subsection (f) of this section shall all be contingent upon the governing authority of each affected municipality entering into a contract with the governing authority of Fulton County whereby the governing authority of each municipality shall agree in substance to reduce the annual ad valorem tax levied by each municipality, beginning with the calendar year immediately following the calendar year during which the responsibility for providing library services was assumed by the countywide library system, by a millage rate equal to the millage rate resulting from converting the dollar amount saved by each respective municipality from the assumption of library services by the countywide library system to a millage rate, based on the net tax digest of each respective municipality. It is not necessary that a contract entered into pursuant to this subsection be confined to the ad valorem tax millage rate reduction formula specified above, and such contract may be stated in such terms as may be necessary to require the increase in ad valorem taxes levied by Fulton County to fund the cost of the countywide library system to be offset by a corresponding decrease in ad valorem taxes levied by affected municipalities. The countywide library system shall not accept the transfer of library facilities and shall not assume responsibility for library services of any municipality failing to enter into a contract provided for by this subsection. 
(h)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, pursuant to a contract with Fulton County for the provision by the countywide library system of public library services and facilities within that portion of the City of Atlanta lying within DeKalb County, the City of Atlanta may create within that portion of the City of Atlanta lying within DeKalb County a special district for the provision of library services and levy and collect within such special district fees, assessments, and taxes to pay any portion of the cost of such services. Any annual ad valorem tax millage rate levied for library services by the City of Atlanta within the special district authorized by this subsection shall be equal to the annual ad valorem tax millage rate levied by Fulton County to support the countywide library system. Such millage rate shall be calculated as follows: 
(1)  Determine the portion of the total annual cost of the countywide library system which is supported by Fulton County ad valorem taxes by subtracting from such total annual cost the total amount of funds supporting the countywide library system which are derived from sources other than Fulton County ad valorem taxes, including fines and fees for overdue, lost, and damaged books, nonresident membership fees, service charges paid by municipalities utilizing the Fulton County library system, State of Georgia grants, federal grants, or both, dedicated for library operations, funds available from the sale of library property initially owned by the City of Atlanta, and any other sources directly associated with Fulton County's operation of the library system, as shown by the annual Fulton County budget; 
(2)  Add the current total net tax digest of Fulton County to that portion of the current total net tax digest of the City of Atlanta derived from taxable property located in DeKalb County; 
(3)  Determine an amount resulting from multiplying the amount determined under subparagraph (h)(2) of this paragraph by a factor derived by dividing the total ad valorem taxes collected by Fulton County for the immediately preceding calendar year by the total ad valorem taxes billed by Fulton County for the immediately preceding calendar year; 
(4)  Divide the amount determined under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph by the amount determined under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph; and 
(5)  Multiply the amount determined under subparagraph (4) of this paragraph by 1,000 to produce the Fulton County ad valorem tax millage rate for the countywide library system. 
In addition to funds derived from fees, assessments, and taxes within such special district, the board of trustees of the countywide library system may use any funds available to such board to provide library services within that portion of the City of Atlanta lying within DeKalb County. The levy of an ad valorem tax by the city within the special district authorized by this subsection shall not constitute a violation of the contract provided for in subsection (g) of this section.

Sec. 26-33. - Transfer of employees; effects. 
Persons who are full-time, permanent employees of all library facilities transferred to the countywide library system shall have the right to enter the employment thereof without any lapse or hiatus in their employment on the terms provided herein. The terms of this section shall apply only to those positions with existing library facilities which are abolished by the dissolution of those facilities. No employee transferred to the countywide library system shall suffer a decrease in salary as a result of being transferred. Every transferred employee shall be assigned by the library board of trustees to a position of employment similar to that occupied by the employee with the former library facility. After being so assigned, all such employees shall be subject to the civil service laws and regulations of Fulton County. For any purpose involving seniority or requiring computation of the period of employment, the former employment with the then existing library facility or the municipal government shall be given the same effect as employment with the county government. Nothing in this section shall affect the power of the library board of trustees of the countywide library system or any other duly authorized officer to dismiss employees for grounds set forth in existing laws and regulations. 
(1982 Ga. Laws (Act No. 1017), page 4174, § 2) 
Sec. 26-34. - Pension funds; certification and transfer. 
(a)  As to pension and retirement rights and benefits of employees being transferred from a municipality to the county, all creditable service with the pension fund of his former employer shall be credited with the pension fund of his new employer in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section. 
(b)  Within 30 days from the date such employee is transferred, the secretary of the pension fund of the former employer shall certify to the secretary of the pension fund of the new employer the total number of years of service, including fractional parts of years, accrued to the credit of each such employee; the amount due such pension fund by each such employee for such credit, if any; the amount of accumulated employee contributions; and the amount of employer matching contributions. Said secretary shall transfer all funds contributed by said employee, together with all employer matching contributions, to the secretary of the pension board of the new employer. In the event that such employee shall owe any sum for prior service credits, said sum shall be payable by such employee to the pension fund of the new employer. In the event that any employee shall have withdrawn any amounts contributed by him to the pension fund of his former employer, the certification of the secretary of such pension fund shall indicate the amount of such contributions withdrawn, and the amount of funds transferred to the secretary of the pension fund of the new employer shall not include such amounts withdrawn by the employee, but shall be payable by the employee to the pension fund of the new employer upon his transfer or at the option of the board of trustees of the pension fund of the new employer, such payment may be deferred and paid in equal installments over a period of 60 months with interest at the rate of seven percent per annum. Upon the date of transfer, the transferred employee shall become a member of the pension fund of his new employer and shall have his rights and obligations determined in accordance with the most recent amendments to such pension fund, but shall be entitled to receive no less benefits from such pension fund than he would have been entitled to receive under the most recent amendments to the pension fund of his former employer on the day prior to his transfer. Upon such certification and transfer of funds, as provided above, such employee shall become entitled to credit for all years of service which may have accrued to him with his former employer to the same extent as if such service had been rendered to his new employer, without the payment of additional contributions (other than amounts previously due for prior service credits or amounts due for withdrawn contributions). The funds transferred in accordance with the above provisions shall become the property of the pension fund of the new employer.

In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state.

It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture.

Said payment may be made in 50 equal monthly installments, bearing interest at the rate of four percent per annum; provided, however, that no credit for years of employment with the State of Georgia shall be allowed in the pension plan of the largest city located in whole or in part in such counties. 
(f)  Any employee of any of said subdivisions of government who is not a member of the pension fund or some part thereof, by reason of having chosen not to participate within the time provided by law, may become a member of said pension plan or part thereof, as the case may be, and obtain the benefits under this section by notifying the secretary of the pension plan of said subdivision of government in writing within 90 days from the date of the transfer of such employee, that he wishes to become a member of said plan or part thereof, as the case may be, and subject to the obligations and benefits and by paying into said pension plan a sum equal to the contribution he would have paid had he chosen to participate within the time originally provided, plus interest at four percent per annum. Said payment may be made in 50 equal monthly installments, bearing interest at the rate of four percent per annum. 
(g)  It is hereby declared to be the legislative determination that in counties and subdivisions of government described in subsection (b) of this section, consolidations in governmental functions between such subdivisions of government and the incident transfer or change of employment, make it in the interest of the employees, subdivisions of government, the pension funds thereof and of the general public that those employees be not deprived of, but be given credit on their pensions for all years of service with the several subdivisions of government. It is the legislative purpose of this section to give authority for and to require that the credits for prior and present employment be given and allowed to the extent and in the manner provided in this section, by the respective pension boards or plans named in subsection (a) of this section.

Upon a proposal being made to such county authority by an interested land owner to lay or construct any of the improvements aforesaid by assessing the cost in any of the ways set forth in [section 50-39], such county authority shall first determine by majority vote of the members thereof whether to refer such proposal to the public works department of said county. If such proposal be not referred in this manner to the public works department, then said proposal shall be deemed to have been refused. Upon such proposal being referred to the public works department, said department or the particular division or officer thereof to whom the duty is delegated by the board of commissioners or other county authority shall prepare plans setting forth the general character, material, location, size and estimated cost of such improvements and return same to the clerk of the board of commissioners or other county authority who shall advertise one time in some newspaper of general circulation in the county ten days before the meeting at which said proposal shall be considered by the county authority, such advertisement giving notice of the introduction of such proposal, a statement of the line or lines along which the proposed improvement is to be laid and a statement of the general character, material, size and estimated cost of such improvements, and the method of distribution of the cost thereof to properties to be assessed therefor, which advertisement shall contain information that owners of lands against whom assessments are proposed to be made, or others interested, are notified to appear at the meeting of said board of commissioners, or other county authority, at the time and place stated in the advertisement, and make any and all objections that they may desire to urge to the making of such improvements and the proposed assessment of the cost thereof. [A] copy of the same notice so published shall likewise be mailed by such clerk at least ten days before the date of the meeting at which such proposal is advertised to be considered by the county authority to each owner of property which it is proposed to assess, either to the known name and address of such owner or to the name and address of owner as same appears on the tax digest or tax returns of said county. Posting of a letter containing such notice by United States mail, duly stamped, and addressed as herein provided shall be deemed sufficient compliance with requirements of this law regarding mailing of notice. Substantial compliance with the above requirements as to notice and the contents thereof shall be sufficient. At said meeting and after hearing objections, if any are made, to the making of said improvements and the assessment of the cost thereof, said board of commissioners, or other county authority, shall have full right and power in its or their discretion to order such improvements made or to reject said proposal and to adopt a resolution accordingly.

In the event of the passage of a resolution authorizing such improvements, all property owners whose property is to be assessed for the cost of such improvements, who do not within 15 days thereafter commence legal proceedings to prevent said assessment being made, shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the terms of said resolution and to have agreed that assessment hereinbefore provided for may be made. Thereupon, it shall be the duty of such board of commissioners, or other county authority, to forthwith cause said improvements to be made in accordance with the plans and specifications. When such improvements have been completed a resolution shall be passed assessing the costs of said improvements as outlined in the advertisement required by this section of this article, which assessment shall constitute a lien against the property so assessed and the owners thereof with the rank, dignity and priority provided by this law. And if any assessment so made against any parcel of land or the owner thereof shall not be paid when due, then execution shall be issued thereon and levied by the Sheriff of Fulton County or his lawful deputy upon the property described therein or any property of the defendant in execution within the county, which property shall be sold in the same manner as other property is sold at sheriff's sales.

Remedy by affidavit of illegality filed with the clerk of the board of commissioners, or other county authority, shall be available to any person against whom execution shall be issued upon an assessment authorized by this law for any right arising after and which could not be urged in a legal proceeding commenced within 15 days after the resolution authorizing such improvements referred to in section 50-40 of this article, provided the person filing such affidavit shall state what, if any, amount he admits to be due, which amount so admitted to be due shall be paid or collected before the affidavit shall be received; and all such affidavits so received shall be returned to the Superior Court of Fulton County and there tried, and the issues determined as in cases of illegality subject to all the pains and penalties provided in cases of illegality for delay. 
(1949 Ga. Laws (Act No. 334), page 1423, § 10) 
Sec. 50-43. - Payment of assessments; installments; executions. 
The Board of Commissioners of Fulton County, or other county authority, shall have the power and authority by resolution to provide for the payment of such assessments in two or more annual installments (not, however, exceeding four annual installments in the aggregate), which county authority shall provide by the resolution assessing the cost or by separate resolution for the due date of such installments and the rate of interest (not exceeding seven percent per annum) to be charged on deferred installments. All persons desiring to avail themselves of the installment plan of payment so provided by said county authority shall, within 60 days after the assessment is made, sign notes in such form and tenor as said county authority shall direct, which notes shall mature and bear interest as provided by the terms of said resolution. Such notes shall be negotiable in form and shall constitute liens against the property so assessed, which property shall be briefly described in the face of the note. In case any one or more of the installments for which notes are given shall become due and remain unpaid, then the remainder of said installments relating to the same property shall become immediately due and payable, and Fulton County or any contractor or person to whom such note or assessment has been transferred shall have the right to have execution issued thereon for the full balance due, with interest to date of issuance of execution plus a penalty of ten percent of the amount then due, and proceed to collect the same by levy upon the property described in such note or any property of such owner within the county, which execution may be levied and said property advertised and sold by the Sheriff of Fulton County or his lawful deputies under the same rules and regulations governing other sheriff's sales in said county. Executions so issued shall be issued in the name of Fulton County, shall bear teste in the name of the county authority of Fulton County and shall be signed by the clerk of the board of commissioners or other county authority.

If a vacancy occurs in an elected position on the board, the board shall, within 60 days thereafter, call a special election to fill the same to be held within 60 days of the call unless such vacancy occurs within 180 days of the next regularly scheduled election, in which case a special election may, but need not, be called. For any election held under the provisions of this Act, notice of said election shall be given the electors by (1) publishing notice thereof in the legal organ of Fulton County on four dates at least 45 days, 31 days, 17 days, and ten days, respectively, prior to such election and (2) contacting each elector at least 31 days prior to such election by U.S. mail at the address indicated in the property tax rolls.

The taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board upon the properties shall be equitably apportioned among the properties according to the need for governmental services and facilities created by the degree of density of development within the district and not for the purpose of providing those governmental services and facilities provided to the county or municipality as a whole. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall be collected by Fulton County in the same manner as taxes, fees and assessments are levied by the county. Delinquent taxes shall bear the same interest and penalties as Fulton County ad valorem taxes and may be enforced and collected in the same manner. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments so levied, less a fee to cover the costs of collection of one percent thereof, but not more than $25,000.00 in any one calendar year, shall be transmitted by Fulton County to the board and shall be expended by the board only for the purposes authorized hereby. 
(b)  The board shall levy the above-provided taxes between January 1 and June 1 each calendar year and notify in writing the collecting governing body by June 15 each year so it may include the levy on its regular ad valorem tax bills. 
(c)  If a parcel of real property is removed from a district or otherwise would become nontaxable it shall continue to bear its tax millage then extant upon such event for bonded indebtedness of the district then outstanding until said bonded indebtedness then outstanding is paid or refunded. 
(d)  In accordance with the requirements of Code Section 36-71-7 of the O.C.G.A., each property paying taxes, fees, or assessments levied by the board for any public facility, as set forth in Section 2 of this Act, shall receive a credit equal to the present value of all such taxes, fees, and assessments toward any impact fee as may be levied by Fulton County against said property for system improvements, as defined under Chapter 71 of Title 36 of the O.C.G.A., known as the "Georgia Development Impact Fee Act", which are in the same category as said public facility.

Sec. 54-42. - Boundaries of the districts. 
(a)  The boundaries of each district shall be as designated as such by the Fulton County Board of Commissioners if wholly within the unincorporated area of Fulton County and such municipalities within which the district may be partially located if partially within the unincorporated area of Fulton County and partially within one or more municipalities, or by the governing authority of a municipality if wholly within the incorporated area thereof, as set forth in the resolutions required in Section 4 of this Act, or as may thereafter be added as provided in this Act. 
(b)  The boundaries of a district may be increased after the initial creation of a district pursuant to the following: 
(1)  Written consent of a majority of the owners of real property within the area sought to be annexed and which will be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board of the district is first obtained; 
(2)  Written consent of owners of real property within the area sought to be annexed which constitutes at least 75 percent by value of the property which will be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board and for this purpose value shall be determined by the most recent approved county ad valorem tax digest; 
(3)  The adoption of a resolution consenting to the annexation by the board of the district; and

Sec. 54-43. - Debt. 
Each district may incur debt without regard to the requirements of article IX, section V of the Constitution of Georgia, or any other provision of law prohibiting or restricting the borrowing of money or the creation of debt by political subdivisions of the State of Georgia, which debt shall be backed by the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the district but shall not be an obligation of the State of Georgia or any other unit of government of the State of Georgia other than the district. 
(1987 Ga. Laws (Act No. 645), page 5460, § 8) 
Sec. 54-44. - Cooperation with local governments. 
The services and facilities provided pursuant to this Act shall be provided for in a cooperation agreement executed jointly by the board and the governing bodies of Fulton County and any municipalities within which the district is partially located. The provisions of this section shall in no way limit the authority of Fulton County or any such municipality to provide services or facilities within the district; and Fulton County or such municipalities shall retain full and complete authority and control over any of their facilities located within their respective areas of any district. Said control shall include but not be limited to the modification of, access to, and degree and type of services provided through or by facilities of the municipality or county.

(h)  In lieu of specifying the rate or rates of interest which such bonds are to bear, and the principal amount and maturities of such said bonds, the notice to the district attorney or the attorney general, the notice to the public of the time, place, and date of the validation hearing, and the petition and complaint for validation may state that the bonds when issued will bear interest at a rate not exceeding a maximum per annum rate of interest (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) and that the principal amount will not exceed and the final maturity date will not be later than as specified in such notices and petition and complaint or may state that, in the event the bonds are to bear different rates of interest for different maturity dates, none of such rates will exceed the maximum rate (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) so specified; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting the right of a board to sell such bonds at a discount, even if in doing so the effective interest cost resulting therefrom would exceed the maximum per annum interest rate specified in such notices and in the petition and complaint. 
(i)  The terms "cost of the project" and "cost of any project" shall have the meaning prescribed herein whenever those terms are referred to in bond resolutions of a board, in bonds, notes, or other obligations of the districts, or in notices of proceedings to validate such bonds, notes or other obligations of a district.

(c)  Issuance by a board of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds, notes or other obligations in connection with the same project or with any other project; but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations are issued shall recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds, notes, or other obligations, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the board to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations on a parity with such prior issue.

The judge of the probate court shall determine the validity of such petition within 60 days of its being filed with the judge of the probate court. In the event the judge of the probate court determines that such petition is valid, it shall be his duty to issue the call for an election for the purpose of submitting such amendment or repeal to the registered electors of the county for their approval or rejection. Such call shall be issued not less than ten nor more than 60 days after the date of the filing of the petition. He shall set the date of such election for a day not less than 60, nor more than 90 days, after the date of such filing.

If more than one-half of the votes cast on such question are for approval of the amendment or repeal, it shall become of full force and effect; otherwise, it shall be void and of no force and effect. The expense of such election shall be borne by the county, and it shall be the duty of the judge of the probate court to hold and conduct such election. Such election shall be held under the same laws and rules and regulations as govern special elections, except as otherwise provided herein. It shall be the duty of the judge of the probate court to canvass the returns and declare and certify the result of the election.

The proceeds of the refunding issue shall be used solely to retire the original debt.

The following definitions and rules of construction shall apply to all ordinances adopted by the board of commissioners unless the context requires otherwise: 
Generally. Ordinary meanings shall be applied to all words, except words of art, or words connected with a particular trade or subject matter, in which case words shall have the significance attached to them by experts in such trade or with reference to such subject matter. The definitions of terms found in generally accepted dictionaries are prima facie evidence of meaning. In making interpretations of ordinances, the courts shall look diligently for the intent of the board of commissioners, as gleaned from the minutes of meetings reflecting the approval of motions by the board of commissioners, recitals found in ordinances and statements of policy and intent adopted by the board of commissioners. Grammatical errors shall not vitiate, and transposition of words and clauses may be resorted to when the sentence or clause is without meaning as it stands. 
Liberal construction; minimum requirements; overlapping provisions. All general provisions, terms, phrases and expressions contained in this Code shall be liberally construed in order that the true intent and meaning of the board of commissioners may be fully carried out. In the interpretation and application of any provision of this Code, such provisions shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare. Where any provision of this Code imposes greater restrictions upon the subject matter than the other provisions of this Code, the provision imposing the greater restriction or regulation shall be deemed to be controlling. 
Captions, maps, etc. In case of any difference of meaning or implication between the text of this Code and any caption, illustration, map, chart, summary table, or illustrative table, the text shall control.

Sec. 2-66. - Declaration of policy. 
It is essential to the proper government and administration of Fulton County that members of the board of commissioners, as well as all other officers and employees of the county, are in fact and in appearance, independent and impartial in the performance of their official duties; that public service not be used for private gain; and that there be public confidence in the integrity of the county. Because the attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists in fact, or appears to exist, a conflict between the private interests and public responsibilities of county officers and employees, the public interest requires that the county protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards of conduct. It is also essential to the efficient operation of the county that those persons best qualified be encouraged to serve in positions of public trust. Accordingly, the standards hereinafter set forth must be so interpreted and understood as not to unreasonably frustrate or impede the desire or inclination to seek and serve in public office by those persons best qualified to serve. To that end, no officer or employee of the county, except as otherwise provided by law, should be denied the opportunity available to all other citizens to acquire and maintain private, economic and other interests, except where a conflict of interest situation would necessarily result. The policy and purpose of this code of ethics, therefore, is to make clear those standards of ethical conduct that shall be applicable to the persons hereinabove named in the discharge of their official duties; to implement the objective of protecting the integrity of the county's government; and to prescribe only such essential restrictions against conflicts of interest as will not impose unnecessary barriers against public service.

(a)  Officers and employees shall avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest.

The appearance of a conflict of interest can exist even in the absence of an actual conflict of interest, which exists whenever the officer or employee knows or should know that he or she has an interest that may be affected by his or her official acts or actions.

Such contract shall include reimbursement to the county of all amounts and costs incurred in attempting to bring the property into compliance.

State Law reference— Exemptions, O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17. 
Sec. 26-39. - Minimum requirements. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation, and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation, and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation, and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsection (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of BMPs shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) of the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where BMPs have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by Fulton County or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act" for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines issued by the director, EPD. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain BMPs shall constitute a violation of any land disturbance permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), The "Georgia Water Quality Control Act" for each day on which such failure occurs. When such non-compliance is identified by the director, official notice will be posted on that property. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16) in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and BMPs, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and/or minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia," published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion. 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum. 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential. 
(4)  When ever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented. 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to practical minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quick as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar BMPs as outlined in the erosion and sediment control manual until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of this section, and O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills. 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
a.  All slopes shall be stabilized immediately and shall remain so for a period of no less than one year from the issuance of the project's final certificate of occupancy and/or the recording of a final plat. 
b.  All slopes greater than or equal to 3H:1V must be permanently stabilized with structural or vegetative BMPs. 
c.  A plan must be submitted to demonstrate that all slopes associated with fill/cut sections have been adequately designed to be stabilized structurally (such as retaining walls) or vegetatively (erosion mat/blanket, tree bark mulch, etc). Such analysis, reports, or design shall be prepared and approved by a design professional. 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of temporary or permanent bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, those such crossings are kept to a minimum. Migrated soil materials or soil materials displaced by mechanical means from land disturbing sites to adjacent water courses, such as lakes, ponds, streams, and creeks etc. must be remediated. The remedial work shall be conducted as per a remedial plan approved by Fulton County. 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 26-39(b)(2). 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director, EPD determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director, EPD pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications are implemented or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director, EPD as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land disturbance activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed, except as otherwise provided by this paragraph. 
Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and steams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director, EPD may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbance activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. 
Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetation cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and natural canopy is left in sufficient quality to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
c.  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 26-39(b) and (c). 
d.  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or terms of the permit. 
e.  Additional requirements. Where the director finds, through inspection, that property owners have been adversely affected due to violations clearly identified by the director, or that the approved current plans do not adequately address the features of the site, the director can require additional BMPs, drawings, and revisions to comply with the minimum requirements as outlined in section 26-39.

Sec. 26-40. - Land disturbance application/permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer, and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal of the general development plans. They shall review the zoning resolution, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention resolution, this article, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of unincorporated Fulton County. However, the property owner or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  Prior to any land disturbing activity, the property in question must be part of an approved and recorded legal lot of record (exemption plat or final plat). Additionally, no land disturbing activity, including grading, excavating, filling, and/or foundation work, shall be conducted within the unincorporated area of Fulton County or in any area where Fulton County has jurisdiction, until a land disturbance permit or a building permit (for those projects not requiring a land disturbance permit under this article) shall have been issued by the director allowing such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. If a project is to be developed in phases, then a separate land disturbance permit or building permit is required for each phase not to exceed 25 acres increments and the development sequence should be followed on all projects issued a land disturbance permit. 
(2)  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Fulton County without first obtaining a permit from the Fulton County Department of Environment and Community Development or its successor to perform such activity. 
(3)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the department of environment and community development and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 26-39(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by nine copies of the applicant's soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans and a physical address of the property owner (Post Office box not acceptable). All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-10. 
(4)  A minimum fee of $125.00, as set by the board of commissioners of Fulton County, shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof of the project area. 
(5)  In addition to Fulton County's permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. Half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(6)  The permit applicant shall be required to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof prior to issuing the permit. The bond amount shall be determined as established by the department. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, Fulton County may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These corrective actions may include, but are not limited to, de-silting detention ponds, water bodies, stormwater facilities, roadways, installing fence with locking device, re-establishing damaged buffer, etc. If a permit applicant has had two or more outstanding violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975 (O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.), as amended within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, Fulton County may deny the permit application. 
(7)  If applicable, immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, Fulton County shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to Fulton County. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 26-39(c)(14) or (15) and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(5) of this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if Fulton County and the district have entered into an agreement which allows Fulton County to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised Plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(8)  If a permit application has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, Fulton County may deny the permit application. 
(9)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 26-39(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this ordinance. The plan for the land disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed. Vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements , dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
(d)  Permits and development activity. 
(1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by Fulton County of a completed application, provided that any necessary variances have been obtained, bonding has been provided, and specifications developed and maintained by the department of public works and permitted by the department of environment and community development have been met, and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued by Fulton County unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district or Fulton County, and unless Fulton County has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 26-39(c)(14) or (15) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 26-40(b)(5) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of unincorporated Fulton County are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applies to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase to include the development sequence. 
(5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by Fulton County, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him of the conditions contained in the permit as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan. 
(6)  Fulton may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7-(f)1.

(a)  The director or designee will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the approved plan, permit and this article and to determine if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling soil erosion and sedimentation. Also, Fulton County shall regulate both primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the tertiary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, an official notice shall be posted on-site, and as a courtesy a written notice to comply shall also be served upon that person, except for working without a permit or working under a stop work order, which warrant immediate citation(s). The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply with the corrective measures specified in the posted official notice within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article, and the director may take such additional enforcement actions as he/she deems appropriate. 
(b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
(c)  The director shall have the power to conduct such investigation as the director may deem reasonably necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose shall have the power to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purposes of investigation and inspection of the sites of land disturbance or building activities. 
(d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of Fulton County, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper, or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties including, but not limited to, the review of reports, studies, calculations, drawings, revisions, practices, actions and bonds. 
(e)  A copy of a current approved plan shall be kept on site until project completion or issuance of certificate of occupancy. 
(f)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the counties or municipality's erosion and sedimentation control program. The districts or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective legal program is found. 
(g)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division may revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

Sec. 26-45. - Penalties and incentives. 
(a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land disturbing activity. If any person commences any land disturbing activity requiring a land disturbing permit, as prescribed in this article, without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit, or other authorization to conduct any business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of Fulton County. Failure to comply may result in a citation being issued to appear in state magistrate court which may result in monetary fines. 
(b)  Stop work orders and notice to comply. 
(1)  On development and residential land disturbance sites for the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the LIA shall post an official notice to comply and as a courtesy issue a written letter. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the LIA shall issue a stop-work order requiring the land-disturbance activity be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of notice to comply. 
(2)  For the third and each subsequent violation, the director or the LIA shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and 
(3)  All stop-work orders shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action has occurred. 
(4)  It shall be unlawful for any representative of the owner to remove an official notice to comply or stop work posting. If this action is observed by a county representative, the owner will be responsible for any and all possible fines. Upon issuance of a stop work order, the director or representative shall post official notice at such locations on the project site as deemed appropriate. Such posted official notice(s) shall be prominently displayed on the owner's property until the stop work order is rescinded by the director, at which time said posted notice(s) will be removed by the director or representative. 
(5)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
(c)  Reinspection fee. The director shall assess a minimum $50.00 reinspection fee to a project if a reinspection is requested prior to the end of a compliance period and the site is found to remain out of compliance upon that inspection. Such fees (to cover administrative, field inspections, and transportation costs) must be satisfied prior to the issuance of a final erosion inspection or a certificate of occupancy. 
(d)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan and permit, an official notice to comply shall be posted on-site and a letter will be issued as a courtesy. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 26-40(b)(6). Fulton County may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
(e)  Non-compliance. Non-compliance with this article shall be dealt with as follows: 
Any person found to be in non-compliance with any provision of this article shall be served official notice by the department of environment and community development. The offender shall, within the period of time stated in the notice, take all necessary action to gain compliance and shall permanently cease such non-compliance. 
(f)  Monetary penalties.

Sec. 26-173. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria. 
The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article: 
(1)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
a.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
b.  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or non-structural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and, 
c.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the director are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, non-structural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
(2)  Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
a.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
b.  24-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; 
c.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
(3)  Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under subsection (2) is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
(4)  Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24 hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
(5)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the county before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the director may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
(6)  Stormwater credits for non-structural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required herein. The applicant may, if approved by the director, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
(7)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public right-of-ways. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more that one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements: 
a.  Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual; 
b.  All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and, 
c.  Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the stormwater design manual. 
(7)  Dam design guidelines. Any land disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.

VI, §§ 26-396—26-410, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 99-1612, § I, adopted Dec. 1, 1999. The "administrative guidelines" referenced herein are on file with the planning and community services department. 

Sec. 26-396. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to cultivate and encourage a high level of tree preservation, to promote the general provisions within this article, and to develop detailed provisions within the administrative guidelines in order to implement the regulations set forth to preserve, maintain and replant trees within unincorporated Fulton County, Georgia. The intent of the ordinance and administrative guidelines is to provide standards for the preservation of trees as part of the land development, building construction and timber harvest processes. It is not the intent of this article to regulate individual properties where activities do not require a land disturbance, building construction or timber harvest permit. 
(b)  Benefits to Fulton County citizens derived from tree protection and replanting include: 
(1)  Improved control of soil erosion. 
(2)  Moderation of stormwater runoff and improved water quality. 
(3)  Interception of airborne particulate matter and the reduction of some air pollutants. 
(4)  Enhanced habitat for desirable wildlife. 
(5)  Reduction of noise and glare. 
(6)  Climate moderation. 
(7)  Aesthetics and scenic amenity. 
(8)  Increased property value. 
(Ord. No. 14-0662, § I, 9-3-14) 
Sec. 26-397. - Authority and applicability. 
(a)  Standards for tree preservation established hereunder supersede and replace those contained in the former Fulton County Tree Preservation Ordinance, adopted and approved on January 8, 1986, codified as §§ 26-396 through 26-403, Fulton County Code of Laws (1997). 
(b)  Terms and provisions of the tree preservation ordinance and the administrative standards established herein, shall apply to all activity which requires the issuance of a land disturbance permit on any real property within unincorporated Fulton County. No land disturbance permit shall be issued by the department of planning and community services (hereinafter the "department" (or any successor to that department) without it being determined that the proposed development is in conformance with the provisions of these regulations. 
(c)  The terms and provisions of these regulations shall also apply to construction of new single-family detached and duplex dwellings, including additions, renovations and/or alterations to existing single-family detached and duplex dwellings. 
(d)  The terms and provisions of these regulations shall also apply to timber harvesting activities. 
(Ord. No. 14-0662, § I, 9-3-14)

(1)  Agent(s), designated or authorized: An individual or entity authorized to administer and enforce the standards set forth in the Fulton County Tree Preservation Ordinance and Administrative Guidelines. 
(2)  Buildable area: The portion of a parcel of land where a building may be located and which shall contain enough square footage to meet the minimum required by the zoning district. That portion which is not located in the minimum setbacks, utility corridors, driveways, slopes to build streets, tree save areas, landscape strips, specimen tree areas, state water buffer, tributary buffers, zoning buffers, wetlands, stormwater and sanitary sewer easements. 
(3)  Buffer: 
a.  State waters buffer: An area along the course of any state waters to be maintained in an undisturbed and natural condition. 
b.  Tributary buffer: A protection area adjoining the tributaries of the Chattahoochee River. Tributary buffer specifications are contained in Part D of each prospective land use section of the Fulton County Tree Preservation Ordinance and Administrative Guidelines. 
c.  Zoning buffer: A natural undisturbed portion of a lot, except for approved access and utility crossings, which is set aside to achieve a visual barrier between the use on the lot and adjacent lots and/or uses. Buffer is achieved with natural vegetation and must be replanted subject to the approval of the director of the department or his/her designated agent(s) when sparsely vegetated. Cleaning of undergrowth from a buffer is prohibited except when accomplished under the supervision of the director of the department or his/her designated agent(s).

(8)  Coniferous: Belonging to the group of cone-bearing evergreen trees or shrubs. 
(9)  County arborist: The agent(s) of Fulton County assigned to the department having the primary responsibilities of administration and enforcement of the tree preservation ordinance. 
(10)  Critical root zone: The area of tree roots within the crown dripline. This zone is generally defined as a circle with a radius extending from a tree's trunk to a point no less than the furthest crown dripline. Disturbances within this zone will directly affect a tree's chance for survival. 
(11)  Crown dripline: A vertical line extending down to the ground from the end of a tree's longest branches. 
(12)  Deciduous: Not persistent; the shedding of leaves annually. 
(13)  D.B.H.: Diameter-at-breast-height is a standard measure of tree size, (for trees existing on-site) and is a tree trunk diameter measured in inches at a height of 4½ feet above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below 4½ feet, refer to chart in Appendix I. 
(14)  Density factor for the site (DFS): A unit of measure used to prescribe and calculate required tree coverage on a site. Unit measurements are based upon tree size. 
a.  Site acreage multiplied by (15) for Agricultural Districts = DFS.

(16)  Improvement setback: An area adjacent to a zoning buffer in which no improvements and/or structures shall be constructed. No development activity such as tree removal, stump removal or grinding, land disturbance or grading is permitted without the approval of the director of the department. 
(17)  Land disturbing activity: Any activity which may result in soil erosion from water or wind and movement of sediments into state water or onto lands within the state, including, but not limited to, clearing, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land but not including agricultural practices as described in Fulton County Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Ordinance of 1996, Fulton County Code of Laws § 26-38(5) (1997), as amended. 
(18)  Land disturbance permit: A permit issued by the department that authorizes the commencement of alteration or development of a given tract of land or the commencement of any land disturbing activity. 
(19)  Landscape plan: A plan that identifies areas of tree preservation and methods of tree protection within the protected zone, as well as all areas of replanting. Within replanting areas, the common and botanical names of the proposed species, the number of plants of each species, the size of all plant materials, the proposed location of all plant materials, and any unique features of the plant materials shall be indicated. 
(20)  Landscape strip: An area required by this article, by the Fulton County Zoning Resolution or any condition of zoning, use permit or variance approval, which is reserved for the installation and/or maintenance of plant materials. 
(21)  Minimum setback: The minimum yards as specified in the regulations related to the zoning districts or use permit categories. A minimum required space between a property line and a structure. An area identified by a building line. 
(22)  Protected zone: Includes, but is not limited to the following: 
a.  Critical root zone plus an additional three feet; all areas of a parcel required to remain in open space; all areas required as landscape strips and/or buffers (including zoning buffers, state water buffers and tributary buffers); tree save areas according to provisions of the Fulton County Zoning Resolution, conditions of zoning, use permit or variance approval, and/or the tree preservation ordinance and administrative guidelines. 
(23)  Revegetation: The replacement of trees and landscape plant materials to satisfy the minimum tree density and landscape requirements, as determined by the Fulton County Zoning Resolution, condition of zoning, use permit or variance approval, or the tree preservation ordinance and administrative guidelines. 
(24)  Roots: 
a.  Feeder roots: A complex system of small annual roots growing outward and predominantly upward from the system of "transport roots". These roots branch four or more times to form fans or mats of thousands of fine, short, non-woody tips. Many of these small roots and their multiple tips are 0.2 to one mm or less in diameter and less than one to two mm long. These roots constitute the major fraction of a tree's root system surface area and are the primary sites of absorption of water and nutrients. 
b.  Major woody roots: First order tree roots originating at the "root collar" and growing horizontally in the soil to a distance of between three and 15 feet from the tree's trunk. These roots branch and decrease in diameter to give rise to "rope roots". The primary functions of major woody roots include anchorage, structural support, the storage of food reserves, and the transport of minerals and nutrients. 
c.  Rope roots: An extensive network of woody second order roots arising from major woody roots, occurring within the surface 12 to 18 inches of local soils, and with an average size ranging from .25 to one inch in diameter. The primary function of rope roots is the transport of water and nutrients and the storage of food reserves. 
d.  Transport roots: The system or framework of tree roots comprised of major woody roots and rope roots. 
(25)  Root collar: The point of attachment of major woody roots to the tree trunk, usually at or near the groundline and associated with a marked swelling of the tree trunk. 
(26)  Root respiration: An active process occurring throughout the feeder root system of trees and involving the consumption of oxygen and sugars with the release of energy and carbon-dioxide. Root respiration facilitates the uptake and transport of minerals and nutrients essential for tree survival. 
(27)  Setback: A space between a property line and the line to which a building or specified structure may be constructed. 
(28)  Soil compaction: A change in soil physical properties which includes an increase in soilweight per unit volume and a decrease in soil pore space. Soil compaction is caused by repeated vibrations, frequent traffic and weight. As related to tree roots, compacted soil can cause physical root damage, a decrease in soil oxygen levels with an increase in toxic gasses, and can be impervious to new root development. 
(29)  State waters: Any and all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage systems, springs, wells, and other bodies of surface or subsurface water, natural or artificial, lying within or forming a part of the boundaries of the state which are not entirely confined and retained completely upon the property of a single individual, partnership or corporation. 
(30)  Thinning: Selective cutting or removal of timber. The basal unit of 30 units per acre for commercial districts and all other non-single-family districts; 20 units per acre for single-family residential districts; 15 units per acre for agricultural districts shall be maintained after selective cutting, or removal of timber has occurred. 
(31)  Timber harvesting: The felling of timber products (pulp wood, etc). The term "timber harvesting" may include both clear cutting and thinning of timber. 
(32)  Tree: 
a.  Tree: Any self-supporting woody perennial plant which has a trunk diameter of two inches or more measured at a point six inches above the ground level and which normally obtains a height of at least ten feet at maturity, usually with one main stem or trunk and many branches. 
b.  Heritage tree: A tree which is designated upon approval by the director of the department or authorized agent(s) to be of notable historical value or interest because of its age, size or historical association. 
c.  Specimen tree: Any tree which has been determined by the county arborist to be of high value because of its type, size, age, or other professional criteria, and has been so designated according to administrative standards established by the department. 
d.  Stand of specimen trees: A contiguous grouping of trees which has been determined to be of value by the director of the department or authorized designee(s). 
1.  A relatively mature even aged stand. 
2.  A stand with purity of species composition or of a rare or unusual nature. 
3.  A stand of historical significance. 
4.  A stand with exceptional aesthetic quality. 
(33)  Tree bank: A site such as a school or public park, where the owner/developer shall donate and plant the required trees when it is not feasible to plant the required trees within their site's project area. 
(34)  Tree preservation ordinance: This article, approved and adopted by the Fulton County Board of Commissioners to provide standards for the protection, preservation and replacement of trees regulated and enforced by the county arborist in conjunction with the department or designated agent(s) through development and construction permits and processes. 
(35)  Tree save area: All areas designated for the purpose of meeting tree density requirements, saving specimen trees, and/or preserving natural buffers. 
(36)  Tributary: Any perennial stream (or portion thereof) within the affected area that is portrayed as a solid blue line on the United States Geological Survey 7.5 Quadrangle Maps, 1968 edition, or other perennial streams as identified by Fulton County. 
(37)  Wetlands: Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bog, and similar areas. 
(38)  Zoning regulations: The Zoning Resolution of Fulton County, as amended or such regulations subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners inclusive of conditions of zoning, use permit or variance approval established pursuant thereto. 
(39)  All other terms: All other words or phrases as appropriate to the context of their uses shall be interpreted as defined in the zoning regulations.

b.  If the director determines that the proposed activity is located in the Wetlands Protection District or within 100 feet of the Wetlands Protection District and that the proposed activity is of a type that could result in a disturbance of wetlands, a COE jurisdictional wetlands determination shall be required prior to issuance of a land disturbance permit. 
c.  If the COE determines that a permit or letter of permission is required, a land disturbance permit shall be issued only following issuance of a COE permit or letter of permission. If the COE determines that the proposed activity would not require a COE permit or letter of permission, the director shall proceed with current procedures for issuing a land disturbance permit based on documentation of the COE determination. If the COE determines that wetlands mitigation is required, the applicant shall perform mitigation in unincorporated Fulton County, unless such action conflicts with the direction of COE. 
d.  If under any of the provision of this section a conflict occurs between the director and the applicant with regards to the proposed activity being a type that could result in a disturbance of wetlands, the applicant shall provide the director with the appropriate COE documentation to resolve the conflict.

Sec. 34-117. - Proper abandonment of wells. 
(a)  Procedure for proper abandonment of wells. Only certified well contractors, acting as agents of property owners, are allowed to abandon wells in accordance with the procedures in this section. 
(1)  Temporarily abandoned well. A water well shall be considered as temporarily abandoned when its use has been interrupted for a period of more than one year, but not more than three years. Such wells shall be sealed and maintained to prevent them from being or becoming a source or channel of pollution when not in service. 
(2)  Permanently abandoned well. A water well shall be considered as permanently abandoned when its service has been interrupted for three years or it is determined by the department to be abandoned. Such wells shall be properly abandoned permanently by the owners. 
(3)  Procedures for the temporary abandonment of wells. 
a.  Casing. A temporarily abandoned well shall be protected with a casing. 
b.  Watertight seal. Upon temporary removal from service, the well shall be sealed with a watertight cap or seal compatible with the casing, and installed so that it cannot be easily removed. 
c.  Maintenance. The well and immediate area shall be kept clear of debris and brush, inspected, and maintained by the owner so it is not a source or channel of contamination. The board of health may require the well to be suitably marked or placarded with a temporary abandonment warning. 
(4)  Procedures for the permanent abandonment of wells. 
a.  Casing removal. The entire well casing and materials should be removed before well closure if such removal will not contaminate the aquifer. Any casing not grouted in accordance with this article shall be removed or properly grouted. Prior to removing the casing, a neat cement plug shall also be added below the lower extremity of the casing. If the contractor is unsuccessful in removing the casing, then a portion of the casing shall be removed to a depth of at least three feet below the ground surface, and a neat cement plug shall also be added at this portion of the casing. 
b.  Sounding. The entire well shall be sounded before sealing to ensure that obstructions will not interfere with sealing operations. 
c.  Disinfection. The well shall be thoroughly disinfected prior to sealing. (See subsection 34-116(6)(b)). 
d.  Bored wells. Bored wells (including hand dug) shall be completely filled with cement grout, dry clay, or material excavated during drilling of the well, then compacted in place. 
e.  Wells in unconsolidated formations. Wells other than bored wells constructed in unconsolidated formations, consisting of sand, sand and clay, or other similar formations, shall be completely filled with cement grout by introducing it through a pipe extending to the bottom of the which can be raised as the well is filled. 
f.  Wells in consolidated formations. Wells, constructed in consolidated formations (consisting of crystalline or metamorphic rock) which penetrate zones of consolidated rock, may be filled with cement, sand, gravel, or drill cuttings opposite the zones of consolidated rock. The top of the sand, gravel, or cutting fill shall be at least five feet below the top of the consolidated rock. The remainder of the well shall be filled with cement grout only. 
g.  Test wells not penetrating water table. Test wells which do not penetrate the water table, shall be abandoned in such manner as to prevent the well from being a channel or source of contamination to the aquifer as approved by the board of health. 
h.  Test wells penetrating water table. Test wells or borings that penetrate the water table shall be sealed by completely filling with cement grout. 
(Res. No. 05-0616, 5-18-05; Ord. No. 18-0340, Att. A, 5-16-18) 
Sec. 34-118. - Water samples. 
(a)  Sampling technique. The following sampling techniques shall be practiced. 
(1)  Bacteriological sampling procedure. A water sample must be taken by the board of health. Only the water to be analyzed shall come in contact with the inside of the bottle or the cap; the water sample must flow into the bottle without touching the hands or any other object while it is being filled. If the water is collected from a sample tap, turn on the tap and allow the water to flow for two or three minutes before collecting the sample. Do not rinse the sample bottle. The sample should be delivered to the laboratory as soon as possible and in no case more than 30 hours after its collection. During delivery, the sample should be kept as cool as possible, but not frozen. The frequency of bacteriological sampling for the various types of water supplies is as follows: 
a.  Private water supply. The sample results must be satisfactory for new and existing wells to be approved for use. 
1.  New well. Sampling shall be required upon completion of construction and following the disinfection of the system. The sample results must be satisfactory before final construction can be approved. Disinfection and sampling must be continued until satisfactory results are obtained. 
2.  Existing well. Upon the request by the property owner, the board of health will sample the supply to determine the bacteriological quality, provided the well construction meets the article requirements. Sampling of unapproved or noncomplying wells shall be at the department's discretion. A fee shall be charged for this service. 
b.  Semi-public water supply. The sample results must be satisfactory for new and existing wells to be approved for use. 
1.  New well. Sampling shall be required upon the completion of construction and following the disinfection of the system. The sample results must be satisfactory before final construction can be approved. Disinfection and sampling must be continued until satisfactory results are obtained. 
2.  Existing well. Existing wells shall be sampled on a quarterly basis (a minimum of four times per year). Additional sampling may be required to ensure compliance with this article and permit requirements. A fee shall be charged for service. 
(2)  Chemical sampling procedure. A water sample for chemical analysis shall be collected after the well has been pumped long enough to remove standing water, residue, and disinfectant chemicals, and to ensure that water from the aquifer has entered the well. The water sample shall be collected in a chemically clean container, preferably one obtained from the laboratory that will perform the analysis. Prior to collecting the sample, the container shall be rinsed several times with the water to be sampled. The laboratory performing the analysis shall provide instructions regarding the quantity of sample required and whether preservatives are needed. In all cases the temperature of the water should be determined (measured) immediately upon collection of the sample. Owners and laboratories must report to the board of health all sample results including those not meeting the standards in this article. The frequency of chemical sampling for the types of water supplies is as follows: 
a.  Private water supply. No chemical analysis shall be required unless deemed necessary by the board of health. 
b.  Semi-public water supply. The sample results must be satisfactory for new or existing wells to be approved for use. 
1.  New well. Samples shall be required upon the completion of the construction and following disinfection of the system. The sample results must be satisfactory before final construction can be approved. Disinfection and sampling must be continued until satisfactory results are obtained. 
2.  Existing well. Samples to measure physical quality may be required at the department's discretion as necessary and/or when the supply is suspected of unfitness due to odor, color, turbidity or other concerns about possible contamination. 
(3)  Physical sampling procedure. A water sample for physical analysis shall be collected after the well has been pumped long enough to remove standing water, development and disinfectant chemicals, and water from the aquifer has entered the well. The water sample shall be collected in a clean container, preferably one obtained from the laboratory that will perform the analysis. The container shall be rinsed several times with the water to be sampled. The laboratory performing the analysis shall provide instructions regarding the quantity of sample required and whether preservatives are needed. In all cases the temperature of the water should be determined (measured) immediately upon collection of the sample. Owners and laboratories must report to this department all sample results, including those not meeting the standards in this article. The frequency of physical analysis for the types of water supplies is as follows: 
a.  Private water supply. No physical analysis shall be required unless deemed necessary by the department. 
b.  Semi-public water supply. The sample results must be satisfactory for new and existing wells to be approved for use. 
1.  New well. Sampling shall be required upon the completion of the construction and following disinfection of the system. The sample results must be satisfactory before final construction can be approved. Decontamination and sampling must be continued until satisfactory results are obtained. 
2.  Existing well. Samples to measure physical quality may be required at the department's discretion as necessary and/or when the supply is suspected of unfitness due to odor, color, or turbidity. 
(b)  Bacteriological limits. Presence of coliform bacteria in water is presumptive evidence of sewage or animal pollution and the possible presence of disease-producing bacteria. No definite conclusions regarding the safety of a water supply can be drawn from a single bacteriological examination. If a water supply is developed and maintained to exclude contamination at all times, a sample demonstrating a coliform concentration below the standard gives reasonable assurance of a safe water supply. A sample is considered satisfactory and meeting the minimum bacteriological quality limits of this article if one or less coliform bacterium per 100 milliliters of sample is present. 
(c)  Chemical limits. The presence of the following inorganic chemicals, in excess of the maximum contaminant levels listed, shall constitute grounds for rejection and non-approval of the water supply (see Table F, "Chemical Limits"). 
(d)  Physical limits. The water shall contain no impurity which would cause offense to the sense of sight, taste, or smell. The limits listed in Table G, "Physical Limits" shall not be exceeded. 
(e)  Other sampling requirements. The frequency and manner of additional sampling, whether for other chemicals and/or for additional or more specific bacteriological analyses, shall be as determined by the board of health. If there is presumption of unfitness because of the presence of undesirable elements, compounds, or materials, periodic determinations for the suspected toxicant or material shall be made more frequently, and a sanitary survey shall also be made to determine the source. Where the concentration of a substance is not expected to increase in processing and distribution, available and acceptable source water analyses performed in accordance with standard methods may be used as evidence of compliance with this article. 
(Res. No. 05-0616, 5-18-05; Ord. No. 18-0340, Att. A, 5-16-18) 
Sec. 34-119. - Cross connection and back siphonage. 
(a)  Cross connection. No person shall allow a public, private, or semi-public water supply to be connected, directly or indirectly, with any other water supply, sewer, drain, conduit, pool, storage reservoir, plumbing fixture, or other device which contains or may contain contaminated water, liquid, gas, sewage (or other waste of unknown or unsafe quality) capable of contaminating the water system. No backflow or potential backflow will be allowed due to configuration bypass arrangement, jumper connections, removable section, swivel or changeover device, or other temporary, permanent, or potential connection. 
(b)  Back siphonage. No outlet from a water supply shall be installed or maintained so that back siphonage is possible. Approved backflow preventer devices shall be required on all outlets to prevent contamination of the water supply and aquifer. The current procedure for backflow and back siphonage prevention and cross connection control shall conform to those recommended by the American Water Works Association (AWWA), "Manual 14", and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), "Cross Connection Manual".

(b)  It shall be the duty of every owner of any public nuisance animal, dangerous dog or vicious dog, or anyone having any such animal in his/her possession or custody, to ensure that the public nuisance animal, dangerous dog or vicious dog is kept under restraint, as prescribed in subsections (d), (e), and (f) of this section and that reasonable care and precautions are taken to prevent the public nuisance animal, dangerous dog or vicious dog from leaving, while unattended, the real property limits of its owner, custodian, or harborer, and it is securely and humanely enclosed within a house, building, fence, locked pen, or other enclosure out of which it cannot climb, dig, jump, or otherwise escape on its own volition. Such enclosure must be securely locked at any time the animal is left unattended so that children are prevented from entry and to prevent the public nuisance animal, dangerous dog or vicious dog from escaping. 
(c)  For owners of a public nuisance animal, dangerous dog or vicious dog whose animal lives out-of-doors, a portion of their property should be fenced with a perimeter or area fence. Within this perimeter fence, the public nuisance animal, dangerous dog or vicious dog must be humanely confined inside a locked pen or kennel of adequate size.

Sec. 34-282. - Notice to dangerous or vicious dog owners. 
(a)  Upon receiving a report of a dog believed to be subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog within a dog control officer's jurisdiction, the dog control officer shall make such investigation necessary to determine whether such dog is subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog. 
(b)  When a dog control officer determines that a dog is subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog, the dog control officer shall mail a dated notice to the dog's owner within 72 hours. Such notice shall include a summary of the dog control officer's determination and shall state that the owner has a right to request a hearing from the animal control hearing board on the dog control officer's determination within seven days after the date shown on the notice; provided, however, that if an animal control hearing board has not been established for the jurisdiction, the owner shall be informed of the right to request a hearing from the probate court for such jurisdiction where the dog was found or confiscated within seven days after the date shown on the notice. The notice shall provide a form for requesting the hearing and shall state that if a hearing is not requested within the allotted time, the dog control officer's determination shall become effective for all purposes under this article. If an owner cannot be located within ten days of a dog control officer's determination that a dog is subject to classification as a dangerous dog or vicious dog, such dog may be released to an animal shelter or humanely euthanized, as determined by the dog control officer. 
(c)  When a hearing is requested by a dog owner in accordance with subsection (b) of this Code section, such hearing shall be scheduled within 30 days after the request is received; provided, however, that such hearing may be continued by the animal control hearing board or probate court for good cause shown. At least ten days prior to the hearing, the animal control hearing board or probate court conducting the hearing shall mail to the dog owner written notice of the date, time, and place of the hearing. At the hearing, the dog owner shall be given the opportunity to testify and present evidence and the animal control hearing board or probate court conducting the hearing shall receive other evidence and testimony as may be reasonably necessary to sustain, modify, or overrule the dog control officer's determination. 
(d)  Within ten days after the hearing, the animal control hearing board or probate court which conducted the hearing shall mail written notice to the dog owner of its determination on the matter. If such determination is that the dog is a dangerous dog or a vicious dog, the notice of classification shall specify the date upon which that determination shall be effective. If the determination is that the dog is to be euthanized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 4-8-26, the notice shall specify the date by which the euthanasia shall occur. 
(e)  Judicial review of the animal control hearing board's final decision may be had in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 15-9-30.9. Judicial review of a probate court's final decision shall be in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 5-3-2 and costs shall be paid as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-3-22. 
(f)  If the animal control hearing board classifies the animal as dangerous or vicious, and no appeal is filed, the owner shall be required to obtain from the animal control officer an annual certificate of registration in compliance with the requirements of this article. No vicious or dangerous animal shall be released to its owners until such certificate is issued by the animal control officer. 
(g)  If the owner fails to obtain the certificate of registration within 30 days of the issuance of the order classifying the animal as dangerous or vicious, the animal may be euthanized no earlier than 35 days after the issuance of the order so classifying the animal. The animal shall not be euthanized if the owner appeals the animal control board's classification order. During the pendency of the appeal and any further appeals, the animal shall not be euthanized, provided that in the event the classification order is upheld at the conclusion of all appeals, the animal may be euthanized no earlier than 35 days after the final order upholding the classification if the owner does not obtain the required certificate of registration within 30 days after the date of the final order of court upholding the classification order. During the pendency of any such appeal by the owner, the animal shall not be released to its owner until the appeal is concluded and the certificate of registration is issued to the owner, if applicable. In such event, the animal will be housed at a licensed veterinarian's office or a licensed commercial kennel and the cost of such detention shall be borne by the owner of the animal. In the event the county appeals the court's order, the animal shall not be released to its owner until the appeal is concluded and the certificate of registration is issued to the owner, if applicable. In the event of an appeal by the county, the animal will be housed in the animal control shelter and the cost of such detention shall be borne by the county.

The county provides services related to the opioid epidemic, which are funded by tax revenues. This Code section clarifies that reimbursement may be sought for the costs of providing such services, whenever practicable, from the responsible party or parties. Without limiting the ability of the county to initiate litigation against any and all parties involved in this crisis or impacting litigation currently pending which was authorized by the county prior to adoption of the ordinance from which this division is derived, the county desires to establish a cost recovery procedure set forth in this division for all current and future litigation to address the opioid epidemic and its effects on the county as a public nuisance.

Costs means all expenditures related to the opioid epidemic that directly or indirectly arise from Fulton County's response to a responsible party's action or inaction. 
Public nuisance is one which damages all persons who come within the sphere of its operation, though it may vary in its effects on individuals. 
Responsible party means any person or corporation whose negligent, intentional, or otherwise wrongful conduct causes the incident resulting in Fulton County incurring costs or who is found liable or made responsible by a court for the costs incurred by Fulton County in the form of damages, regardless of the cause of action. This does not include the individuals whom are addicted to opioids. 
(18-0097, 2-7-18) 
Sec. 34-370. - Opioid abuse a public nuisance. 
Fulton County hereby finds and declares the following: 
(1)  That addiction to and abuse of opioids by Fulton County residents is one of the greatest challenges facing Fulton County; 
(2)  A cause of this increasing crisis is the overabundance of prescription opioids. Vast amounts of prescription opioid pain pills were sold, distributed and prescribed in Fulton County over the past several years which practice continues today; 
(3)  There is evidence showing that approximately four in five heroin users began their addiction by first using and then misusing prescription pain medications containing opioids; 
(4)  The negligent and/or reckless selling, distributing, and prescribing of large amounts of opioid pain pills by responsible parties in Fulton County has created a public health and safety hazard affecting the residents of Fulton County, resulting in devastation to families in the county, a negative effect on Fulton County's economy, wasted public resources, and a generation of narcotic dependence; 
(5)  That the negligent and/or reckless selling, distributing, and prescribing of prescription opioid pain pills by responsible parties is a hazard to public health and safety, which has created a public nuisance to the citizens of Fulton County, and said nuisance remains unabated; 
(6)  That, in addition to all other powers and duties now conferred by law upon Fulton County, Fulton County is authorized to enact ordinances, issue orders, and take other appropriate and necessary actions for the elimination of hazards to public health and safety and to abate or cause to be abated anything which the board of commissioners determines to be a public nuisance; 
(7)  That certain manufacturers of prescription opioids and those in the chain of distribution as responsible parties have wrongfully abused the privilege of selling and/or providing medication to Fulton County residents and must be held accountable; and 
(8)  That it is the duty of Fulton County to vindicate the rights of Fulton County residents and take action to abate this public nuisance. 
(18-0097, 2-7-18) 
Sec. 34-371. - Governmental function cost recovery. 
Fulton County has the power and has acted to recover the costs of governmental functions related to opioids marketed, sold, manufactured, dispensed, prescribed, and/or distributed by the responsible parties. If a responsible party fails to pay the costs demanded, Fulton County may initiate and recover costs through administrative, civil, and/or criminal action against the responsible party. In that case, Fulton County may also recover attorney's fees, interest, and any other payment or type of damages the court deems proper. 
(18-0097, 2-7-18) 
Sec. 34-372. - Effect of criminal or civil proceedings on governmental function cost recovery. 
Fulton County's initiation of administrative or civil proceedings for governmental function cost recovery does not bar the criminal prosecution of a responsible party for any associated violation. Similarly, criminal prosecution does not bar civil collection of costs for the violation giving rise to the criminal prosecution. 
(18-0097, 2-7-18) 
Sec. 34-373. - Violation; penalty. 
Violation of this Code division shall subject the violator to all damages recoverable under a civil proceeding. Criminal penalty for violation of this division shall be the same as promulgated in section 34-365 of article VII of this chapter.

Sec. 34-374. - Application. 
This division shall apply to all pending or future actions taken by the county in furtherance of its efforts to address the opioid epidemic in Fulton County.

Test holes shall not be located in or near streams, draws, banks, stump holes or any other location where percolation test rates would not be representative of typical soil and terrain conditions. Tests holes shall be flagged, staked and numbered in accordance with the soil data record and site plan. All test hole locations including those with passing and failing results shall be shown, including depth of test holes. 
b.  Preparation of test hole. Percolation test holes shall be dug or bored with vertical sides, shall be no less than four inches in width and shall extend to the proposed depth of the absorption field. On slopes less than 20 percent, minimum depth of test holes shall be 30 inches to 48 inches, and on slopes greater than 20 percent, the depth of test holes shall be 84 inches. On projects where grading in the field area is proposed, the test holes shall be 30 inches to 48 inches below the proposed finished elevation. Sides of test holes shall be scratched with a pointed instrument to remove smeared soil surfaces and to provide a more natural soil interface into which water may percolate. Loose material shall be removed and no less than two inches of clean gravel shall be added. 
c.  Saturation and swelling of soil. Percolation test holes shall be filled with water (and kept completely filled in 30-inch to 48-inch test holes) and kept to an elevation at least three feet above the bottom of the deeper test holes until the soil is saturated and clays have had an opportunity to swell. No tests shall be performed until the soil has been soaked at least four consecutive hours. Overnight soaking is prohibited. 
d.  Percolation rate measurement. After soaking, water depths in the percolation test holes shall be adjusted until approximately six inches of water remains over the gravel. From a fixed reference point, established at or near ground surface, repeated measurements shall be made at equal time intervals of the vertical distance in inches from the reference point to the water surface. Water shall be added to restore a six-inch depth if the water falls to less than two inches above the gravel surface. Measurements shall be continued until a constant percolation rate is evidenced, i.e., the water surface drops the same vertical distance each time interval. The time in minutes required for the water column to drop one inch at this constant rate shall be recorded as the percolation rate. When percolation rates vary significantly or exceed 90 minutes/inch fall within the proposed absorption field, additional tests may be required and data on all tests performed (passing and failing) must be submitted for review. 
(2)  Borings. 
a.  Location. Borings shall be located in areas proposed for the absorption field and shall not be located in floodplains, easements nor in any other area restricted by this article. Borings shall be flagged and numbered accordingly with the soil data record and site plan. All test hole locations, including those with passing and failing results, shall be shown including depth of borings. 
b.  Water table borings. Borings to determine groundwater elevation in low areas may be required by the board of health. Borings shall be made to a minimum depth of seven feet. On projects where grading in the field area is proposed, the borings shall be at least seven feet below the proposed finished elevation. Water table elevations shall not be recorded until 48 hours have elapsed for stabilization of groundwater. Location, identification number and depth to water table shall be recorded on the site plan and soil data record. Other records of water table elevation, including seasonal peaks, may be submitted or required. 
c.  Rock borings. Where surface outcroppings or subsurface rock or hardpan exist or are suspected, a sufficient number of borings to a minimum depth of seven feet shall be required by the board of health to determine if such conditions may interfere with installation, performance or repair of the proposed onsite sewage management system. 
d.  Additional depth. Water table and rock borings shall be required at a minimum depth of 11 feet in areas with slopes greater than 20 percent. 
e.  Negative evidence. Evidence of the presence of water or rock in the borings shall negate approval for present and future use of the area tested for installation of an onsite sewage management system.

Sec. 34-514. - Sewage flow. 
The maximum anticipated daily sewage flow shall be determined from tables D and E, sewage flow schedule and maximum occupancy. Design flows for establishments not listed shall be determined by the board of health after review of data and design criteria submitted by the owner or his agent and shall be a minimum of three times the peak monthly water usage, if based on existing development water bills and if proposed and existing developments are the same size and use. Calculations shall be made on the basis of peak flow and ultimate usage of the facility. The maximum anticipated daily sewage flow of any of the above facilities other than food service establishments, taverns, bars and cocktail lounges shall be determined by multiplying the maximum occupancy (M.O.) (see table E) times the daily flow in gallons per individual or unit where applicable. For food establishments the minimum number of anticipated customers shall be calculated on a basis of two times the maximum occupancy times the number of meal services, i.e., minimum number of anticipated customers = 2 × M.O. × number of meal services. For taverns, bars and cocktail lounges the minimum number of anticipated customers shall be calculated on a basis of two times the maximum occupancy for the establishment, i.e., minimum number of anticipated customers = 2 × M.O. If the estimated number of customers, employees, etc., as indicated in the owner's letter of intent exceeds the calculated values, the higher number shall be used in determining the size of the onsite sewage management system. 
(Res. of 9-7-88(3), § 30-2-7-9; Ord. No. 18-0340, Att. A, 5-16-18)

(3)  Capacity. Minimum capacity for any septic tank shall be 750 gallons. The minimum tank size required for single-family dwellings with one or two bedrooms shall be 750 gallons, dwellings with three bedrooms shall be 1,000 gallons and dwellings with four or five bedrooms shall be 1,500 gallons. Total tank capacity will be increased by 250-gallon increments for each additional bedroom over five. Use of garbage grinders is not recommended in conjunction with onsite sewage management systems. If a grinder is to be utilized then an additional 50 percent tank storage capacity shall be required, i.e., 500 gallons more for a 1,000-gallon system. The maximum tank capacity for a nonresidential onsite sewage management system shall be 10,000 gallons. 
(4)  Tanks in series. The board of health may approve the serial installation of uncompartmented septic tanks if the tanks are of equal capacity. Connecting lines shall be nonperforated. An interior connection of the tanks may be allowed if the conduit is solid pipe and all joints between pipe and tanks are smooth, nonleaking and impervious. 
(5)  Foundation and backfill. Septic tanks shall be constructed or installed level on a foundation of solid unexcavated ground (no fill) that will prevent settling. Backfill shall be free of voids, stumps, broken masonry or other such materials.

(1)  Minimum design and construction. Distribution boxes shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the current DHR Manual For On-Site Sewage Management Systems. 
(2)  Foundation and backfill. The foundation and backfill for distribution boxes shall be in accordance with subsection (a)(5) of this section. 
(3)  Capacity. The box shall be of sufficient capacity to temporarily store the effluent from the dosing tank or effluent pump during redistribution to the absorption trenches. The maximum liquid level shall be no less than four inches below the top of the box (bottom of the lid). 
(d)  Grease trap. 
(1)  Required. Grease traps are required for all food service establishments and nonresidential kitchens where it is determined by the board of health that introduction of grease into the onsite system might adversely affect it. Grease traps are neither necessary nor recommended for onsite sewage management systems serving residences. 
(2)  Design. Grease trap plans and specifications shall be submitted to the board of health for approval. No human waste shall pass through the grease trap. No grease trap shall have less than 750 gallons capacity and its effluent shall be directed to the septic tank. Grease traps shall be sized (minimum capacity) by multiplying three gallons times the maximum occupancy (see table E) times two for food service establishments. Grease trap size requirements for nonresidential kitchens shall be based on the maximum occupancy of the structure times three gallons. 
(3)  Construction. Grease traps shall be located, installed and constructed so that the temperature of the sewage will be reduced to permit congealing or separation of grease and easy access for cleaning is provided. Construction shall be in accordance with the specifications and details in the current DHR Manual For On-Site Sewage Management Systems. 
(e)  Sewage effluent pump. In the event that the sewage generated from a building or residence cannot be plumbed to an absorption field by gravity, then an onsite sewage management system may be modified by installing a sewage effluent pump (no sump pumps allowed) with the necessary appurtenances as determined by the board of health. Included but not limited to the following appurtenances are: a separate pump chamber from the septic tank, pump controls, level control switches, warning buzzer and/or light for power failure or pump malfunction, approved ventilation, manhole cover, check valve on discharge line, emergency bypass plumbing with absorption pit (20-ton minimum), piping, fittings and distribution box for pump discharge prior to entering absorption field. All wiring shall be installed underground meeting electrical codes. All material specifications, warranties and construction plans must be submitted by the owner or agent for the owner and reviewed and approved by the board of health, prior to issuance of a permit to construct the onsite sewage management system. Design and construction shall be in accordance with the specifications and details in the current DHR Manual For On-Site Sewage Management Systems. 
(f)  Absorption pit. Absorption pits may not be utilized in any new construction with the following exceptions: 
(1)  Washer pit. An adequately-sized absorption pit (20-ton minimum) may be constructed and placed to receive the greywater from a clothes washing machine only if permitted by the board of health. 
(2)  Basement bathroom. In the event that a basement bathroom is proposed and there is not sufficient area for a conventional field and the bathroom cannot be plumbed by gravity into the main onsite sewage management system or a public or community sewerage system, an adequately sized absorption pit (20-ton minimum) may be constructed together with a septic tank if permitted by the board of health. 
(3)  Emergency overflow. In the event that a sewage effluent pump is utilized in a residential or commercial onsite sewage management system, then an adequately sized absorption pit (20-ton minimum) shall be constructed and used for emergency overflow in case the pump malfunctions or electrical power is temporarily interrupted. 
(4)  Size calculations. Absorption pits shall be sized in accordance with the following criteria: 
a.  Residential. The volume of aggregate to be used in the absorption pit shall be equivalent to the corresponding amount used in a conventional absorption field trench per bedroom based on percolation rates as indicated in section 34-517, size of pit for a 450 square feet/bedroom rate (one bedroom only): 450 square feet × 1 foot (depth) × 100 pounds/c.f. 2,000 pounds/ton = 22.5 tons. 
b.  Commercial. The volume of the absorption pit shall be calculated by multiplying the maximum anticipated daily sewage flow in gallons per day (see table D) times three. The volume in gallons shall be converted to cubic feet and tonnage of aggregate accordingly. 
(5)  Design and construction. The minimum depth of an absorption pit shall be six feet with a minimum cover of 12 inches. A continuous layer of geotextile drainage fabric (building paper and straw not allowed) approved by the board of health, shall be placed over the aggregate along with a minimum 12-inch wide strip of aluminum foil along the entire perimeter of the pit before backfilling. The pipe entering the pit shall terminate downwards a minimum of 12 inches in the center of the pit for all pits except "in line" repair pits.

(Res. of 9-7-88(3), § 30-2-7-10; Ord. No. 18-0340, Att. A, 5-16-18) 
Sec. 34-516. - Sewage conduits. 
(a)  Size. Sewage conduits connecting component parts of an onsite sewage management system shall be sized adequately to accommodate the anticipated maximum daily sewage flows as determined by the board of health. 
(b)  Materials. All pipe and fittings used in sewage conduits and/or absorption fields shall meet nationally recognized standards for their designated use, i.e., standards published by the American Society for Testing and Materials or the National Sanitation Foundation, and shall have been approved by the board of health for use in onsite sewage management systems. Sewage conduits under driveways or similar areas of load or impact shall be of material capable of withstanding maximum anticipated loads, i.e., schedule 40 PVC, etc. 
(c)  Construction. Sewage conduits, other than distribution lines, shall be installed with sealed, watertight, root-resistant joints, laid on a firm foundation not subject to settling, in straight alignment and installed at a grade not less than one-eighth inch per foot (gravity lines). All conduits shall be installed at a depth to allow a minimum of 18 inches of cover. All exposed conduits (aboveground) and conduits installed in fill areas shall be ductile iron, properly supported and insulated, and sized to accommodate maximum anticipated sewage flow. 
(Res. of 9-7-88(3), § 30-2-7-11; Ord. No. 18-0340, Att. A, 5-16-18) 
Sec. 34-517. - Absorption field. 
(a)  Area computation. The determination of the absorption trench bottom area to be required shall be based upon both the maximum anticipated daily sewage flow from the proposed facility and upon the characteristics of the soil in which the absorption field is to be located. Soil characteristics shall include percolation rates determined in the manner set forth under section 34-513, together with types of soil encountered, drainage conditions and other related data that may be required by the board of health. 
(1)  Residential lots. Trench bottom areas for residential onsite sewage management systems shall be not less than those shown below: 

 
No additional trench area shall be required when an additional bathroom or wetbar is proposed if it is connected to the main onsite sewage management system. If a basement bathroom is proposed below the elevation of the main system, then a minimum 750-gallon septic tank and 300 square feet of absorption trench is required, actual trench area shall be based on percolation test rates. Split systems may require additional absorption trench area compared to a single system. 
(2)  Commercial development. Total absorption trench bottom area for nonresidential onsite sewage management systems shall not be less than the area obtained by multiplying the maximum anticipated daily sewage flow (gallons) by the percolation coefficient, i.e., one-fifth of the square root of the average percolation rate, e.g., one-fifth times the square root of the percolation rate × gallons = total absorption trench bottom area. The maximum anticipated daily sewage flow shall be determined in accordance with the sewage flow schedule, table D of this article. The maximum total absorption trench bottom area for a nonresidential/commercial onsite sewage management system shall be 9,000 square feet. The minimum size nonresidential/commercial onsite sewage management system shall include at least a 750-gallon septic tank and 300 square feet of absorption trench bottom area. 
(b)  Location. No absorption field shall be installed within the minimum separation distance indicated in table C from the referenced items, existing or proposed, nor in areas with unsuitable fill material. However, if fill section has been in existence for a minimum of ten years (appropriate documentation as required by the board of health) and normal compaction has taken place, then field lines may be allowed in the fill section based on satisfactory soils reports. A reduction in the minimum normal compaction timeframe (ten years) may be considered based on satisfactory lab tests and a favorable opinion from a soil scientist or soils engineer. If wells and onsite sewage management systems are in place on contiguous lots, 100 feet of separation shall be maintained between any well and any absorption field. Absorption fields shall not be installed in the floodplain nor where groundwater or adverse geological formations may interfere with the absorption of treated sewage or result in the contamination of groundwater. Absorption fields shall not be installed in areas subject to excessive surface water, ponding or runoff, including but not limited to stormwater and discharge from building gutters. Absorption fields shall not be installed where ground slopes exceed 20 percent, but sites with slopes exceeding 20 percent may be considered if investigations demonstrate that the slope limitation can be overcome by design or site modification (see details A and F). The board of health, after site inspection, may require greater separation distances due to adverse conditions such as topography, subsurface soil characteristics and/or groundwater sources. No part of the absorption field shall ever be covered by buildings, pavement or be used for vehicular traffic or parking. 
(c)  Minimum design and construction. Absorption trenches shall be on grade throughout, constructed in minimum lengths (runs) of 50 linear feet, shall be no less than 30 nor more than 46 inches in depth, shall be at least 36 inches in width and shall enable placement of at least 12 inches of earth cover over distribution lines. If unfavorable soil conditions (high clay content, hard pan, etc.) are encountered at normal installation depths, trenches may be installed at greater depths if approved appropriate, site modifications are performed and acceptable percolation test rates can be shown to exist at these depths, and the soil meets all requirements for installation of absorption fields with respect to rock, groundwater elevations, etc. Absorption trenches shall be spaced not less than seven feet apart between trench walls nor closer than five feet to any septic tank. Perforated pipe shall be laid in the center of the trench with perforations oriented toward the bottom of the trench and appropriate fittings used where needed. Pipe crossings under roadways or paved areas shall not be considered in determining the total absorption trench bottom area. If an illegal trash pit is encountered during construction, then an absorption trench bypass must be installed in accordance with detail B meeting the approval of the board of health. Aggregate shall be placed under the absorption line to a minimum depth of six inches and shall extend the full width of the trench, and two inches of aggregate shall cover the absorption line (total depth of aggregate shall be a minimum of 12 inches). A continuous layer of approved geotextile drainage fabric (building paper and straw not allowed) shall be placed over the aggregate before backfilling to prevent siltation in the aggregate. A minimum 12-inch wide, continuous layer of aluminum foil shall be placed along the centerline of the absorption trench prior to backfilling to facilitate future location of the field line. Excavation for absorption trenches in wet clay soils and smearing of trench walls and bottoms shall be avoided so that permeability will not be reduced. Approvals may be withheld where such damage has occurred. Absorption fields shall not be installed in areas where percolation test rates exceed 90 minutes per inch. 
(1)  Vertical piping. Additional vertical piping may be installed (and required as necessary) in the absorption trenches, connected to the distribution lines and specifically located at the highest elevated portion of each trench to accommodate periodic addition of oxidizing agents to facilitate maintenance of the system. Vertical pipes shall not extend more than six inches above the ground surface (finished grade) and shall be capped to minimize rainfall infiltration and vandalism. 
(d)  Field layout methods. Absorption fields shall be designed and installed in accordance with one of the following methods: 
(1)  Distribution box method. The distribution box method may be used on level or moderately sloping topography. This method is required for all systems using dosing tanks and sewage effluent pumps. A level reinforced concrete foundation (minimum four-inch thick slab) shall be provided for approved precast distribution boxes to ensure against tilting. It shall extend a minimum of six inches beyond the box in both dimensions. Extreme care must be exercised in backfilling around and over the distribution box. There shall be no less than 12 inches nor more than 24 inches of cover over the box. Influent lines from the septic tank, dosing tank or pump chamber shall terminate inside the distribution box via an elbow turned downward to form a submerged inlet at normal water level. Equal absorption trench areas, not exceeding 600 square feet, shall be connected to distribution box outlets by independent sewers. A combination of standard and modified absorption trenches may be installed if prior approval is given by the board of health. While such absorption trenches may be installed at the same or different elevations, all lines (two or more lines required) leading from the distribution box to absorption trenches shall be schedule 40 PVC; installed level, on a solid bed of aggregate (12 inches minimum width) and at the same elevation for the initial two feet; shall be watertight and, for the remainder of the sealed length, minimum grade shall be one-eighth inch per foot. All perforated distribution lines shall be laid on a uniform grade with no more than four inches of fall per 100 linear feet of absorption trench. 
(2)  Level field method. The level field method may be used only on flat terrain. When this method is used, all absorption field trenches shall be installed level and at the same elevation, shall not exceed 100 linear feet in length and shall be connected at the ends to form a continuous system. A combination of standard and modified absorption trenches may be installed if prior approval is given by the board of health. A standard tee fitting or a distribution box shall be used to distribute treated sewage, shall be not less than five feet from the septic tank, and shall have an invert at least four inches below the septic tank outlet invert. A standard tee fitting shall be used to effect a juncture of the ends of any three distribution lines. 
(3)  Serial distribution method. The serial distribution method may be used in areas with sloping topography. Absorption trenches shall be constructed level (maximum four inches of fall per 100 linear feet) and shall follow contours. A combination of standard and modified absorption trenches may be installed if prior approval is given by the board of health. All effluent from the septic tank must traverse the uppermost distribution line before entering overflow sewers (solid line) and the system must be constructed so that each trench is filled with effluent to the full depth of aggregate before it enters succeeding trenches via overflow connections. Overflow sewer connections shall be required only when there is an overall change in trench bottom elevations. The invert of the first overflow sewer must be at least four inches below the invert of the septic tank outlet. At the point where an overflow sewer connects absorption trenches, the invert of the overflow sewer shall be no deeper than the top of the aggregate in the preceding absorption trench, so that an undisturbed block of earth will remain in place for the full depth of the aggregate. Overflow sewers connecting absorption trenches shall be laid on undisturbed earth. Care must be exercised in backfilling over the overflow sewer to prevent damage and there shall be a minimum of 12 inches of earth cover over the sewers. 
(4)  Modified serial/level method. The modified serial/level method may be used in areas with gentle sloping topography only if specifically approved by the board of health. All construction specifications and requirements are the same as those for the serial distribution and level field methods except: 
a.  Lengths of "feeder line" trenches may vary throughout the system. 
b.  Ends of "feeder line" trenches should be connected to ends of other "feeder line" trenches whenever possible and as directed by the board of health. 
c.  "Feeder line" trenches branching off the main distribution line trench shall be connected with standard tee fittings. 
d.  Portions of the modified system may be installed via the level field method and connected to other portions of the modified system installed via the serial distribution method. See detail C for more information. 
(e)  Modified absorption trench—Double side. A variation of the standard absorption trench may be utilized only with board of health approval on lots where the available area to install the absorption field is limited, thus necessitating placement of two standard distribution lines in one absorption trench. The trench width shall be six feet with the distribution lines spaced on a two-foot center with two feet of trench width on either side of the lines. All other construction specifications shall be in accordance with this article. This modified absorption trench will be specifically used for repairs and in initial installations where space is limited to maintain the reserve area. 
(f)  Modified absorption trench—Deep percolation. Where the available area to install the absorption trench has unsatisfactory percolation test results at the normal installation depths (30 inches to 48 inches), a variation of the standard absorption trench may be utilized if approved by the board of health. The modified trench depth shall be equal to the depth at which satisfactory percolation test results were obtained. The invert (bottom) of the distribution line shall be no deeper than 42 inches. Placement of aggregate shall be below the invert of the distribution line to the bottom of the trench and shall extend to a height of two inches above the top of the distribution line (minimum 12 inches depth of aggregate). All other construction specifications are in accordance with this article, specifically this section and detail E. 
(g)  Modified absorption trench—Steep slope. Where the available area to install the absorption trench has a ground surface slope exceeding 20 percent and it is impractical or undesirable for the owner to modify the site (benching or terracing) to accommodate a conventional absorption trench a variation of the standard absorption trench may be utilized if approved by the board of health. The modified trench shall be extended to a depth of 66 inches with the invert (bottom) of the distribution line installed at a depth of 60 inches. Aggregate shall be placed from six inches below the distribution line to two inches above the top of the distribution line, total depth of aggregate being 12 inches. Vent stacks (constructed with solid four inches PVC, schedule 40) shall be connected to the distribution line with tees and shall extend no less than six inches above finished grade. Vent stacks shall be installed at 50-foot intervals along the entire length of the system. They may be hooded with ventilated caps (optional) to minimize rainfall infiltration and vandalism. Initial installation of the stacks shall be accomplished to leave at least three to four feet above the ground surface (staked and flagged) for ease of identification and minimize destruction and possible removal or lowering of the vents during final grading and landscaping. Tops of stacks shall be lowered only after all construction is completed. All other construction specifications must be in accordance with this article, specifically this section and detail F.

(a)  Title of section. This section shall be known as the Fulton County Juvenile Curfew Ordinance. 
(b)  Findings and purpose. It is the responsibility of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Fulton County. The Fulton County Board of Commissioners is concerned about the increase in criminal activity engaged in by minors especially those crimes that occur after hours and/or times in which juveniles should be at home. During public hearings held in Fulton County, many parents voiced their concerns about the increase in youth violence, the need to protect our children from being victims of crimes that occur after hours, and the need to make parents more responsible for their children. These parents have stated that a child curfew ordinance is one initiative in protecting our children from being the victims and perpetrators of crime. In an effort to keep our communities drug free and our streets safe by reducing the numbers of crimes that are committed by and against minors after hours, the board of commissioners believes that a child curfew ordinance is in the best interest of the citizens of Fulton County. As one parent expressed at a public hearing, "a juvenile curfew ordinance is an attempt by Fulton County to save at least one child's life." Accordingly, the Fulton County Board of Commissioners finds and declares that the purpose of this section is to reduce the number of crimes committed by and against juveniles after hours, and to safeguard the welfare of our children in areas in unincorporated Fulton County.

DIVISION 2. - LOITERING[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 11-0894, adopted Oct. 5, 2011, set out provisions intended for use as §§ 46-141—46-144. For purposes of classification, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as Div. 2 and the former Div. 2 "False Alarms" has been renumbered as Div. 3. 

Sec. 46-141. - Generally. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful within the unincorporated area of the county for any person to remain or loiter in front of any public place, or on the sidewalks or public streets or roads of the county after having been directed by a police officer or other member of law enforcement to move away therefrom. 
(b)  A person commits the offense of loitering when the person is in a place at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. 
(c)  Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself or herself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a law enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself or herself and explain his or her presence and conduct. No person shall be convicted of an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer fails to comply with the foregoing procedure or if it appears at trial that the explanation given by the person was true and would have dispelled the alarm or immediate concern. 
(Ord. No. 11-0894, Exh. A, 10-5-11) 
Sec. 46-142. - Loitering for purpose of procuring others to engage in sexual acts for hire. 
(a)  Legislative findings and intent. 
(1)  The board of commissioners finds that sex acts for hire are inherently exploitative, endanger the health, safety and welfare of the participants and citizens in general, affect property values, and are an affront to the dignity of our citizens. These exploitative acts adversely affect a property or area in which they occur and lead to the avoidance of such places by law-abiding citizens, lead to an increased opportunity for unlawful criminal activities, and further decays neighborhoods. 
(2)  The county has a strong interest: (i) in ensuring that citizens feel safe in their neighborhoods, (ii) in protecting the health of its citizens, (iii) in safeguarding the economic vitality of its business districts, and, (iv) in preserving peace and order in public places to enable them to be used for their intended purposes. 
(3)  Loitering for purpose of procuring others to engage in sex acts for hire usually includes a power imbalance between those seeking to purchase the sexual services and those being exploited to perform the sex acts, with the persons procuring the sexual services tending to be more economically and socially advantaged than the people who would provide the sex acts. A person seeking to purchase the sexual services bears a greater responsibility for the transaction than does the person being prostituted. Furthermore, it is widely acknowledged by criminal justice experts that holding purchasers, or "johns," principally accountable for these sex acts for hire is the most effective method available to reduce the incidence of prostitution in an area. 
(4)  This section is not intended to limit any person from exercising the right to assemble or engage in any other constitutionally protected activity. This section applies to all persons with the requisite intent to induce another to engage in sex acts for hire. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter, as defined in section 46-141, in or near any thoroughfare or place open to the public in a manner and under circumstances manifesting the purpose of inducing, enticing, soliciting, pandering, or procuring another to commit a sexual act for hire. This section is not intended to limit any person from exercising their right to assemble or engage in any other constitutionally protected activity. This section applies to all persons with the requisite intent to induce another to engage in a sexual act for hire. 
(c)  A police officer who observes a person loitering under circumstances that provide the officer with an articulable suspicion to believe a sexual act for hire has occurred or is occurring may detain the individual for the purpose of investigating whether the person is in violation of this section. 
(d)  A police officer may detain an individual under this section if an element from subsection (1) and an element from subsection (2) below are satisfied: 
(1)  The person engages in one or more of the following behaviors: 
a.  Repeatedly circling the block in a motor vehicle; 
b.  Stopping a motor vehicle in a county roadway to beckon to, stop, or engage with persons on the side of the road; 
c.  Repeatedly stopping or attempting to stop motor vehicle operators by hailing, waving of arms or any bodily gesture; 
d.  Driving around or sitting in a parked car in a parking lot or vacant lot; or 
(2)  One of the following factors applies: 
a.  The officer has knowledge of a specific reliable tip concerning unlawful prostitution-related activity at a specific location, and the person who is found loitering is doing so at a time, in a place or in a manner that is otherwise consistent with the details provided in the tip; 
b.  The person is loitering in an area that is known to be a common location for prostitution-related activity; 
c.  The person is on the premises of a hotel or other business that is associated with an advertisement for prostitution-related activity; 
d.  The person is a non-resident of the area, and is present in the area outside of normal business hours and without legitimate business in the area; 
e.  The officer knows that the person has been previously convicted of loitering with the intention of procuring others to engage in sexual acts for hire under this section; or 
f.  Any vehicle the person has approached or communicated through is registered to an individual who has been convicted of an unlawful prostitution-related activity in the previous three years, and the officer is aware of that fact. 
(e)  For purposes of this section "sexual act for hire" means conduct which constitutes an offense defined in O.C.G.A. tit. 16, ch. 6, as amended; conduct which constitutes complicity to commit such an offense; or conduct which constitutes conspiracy to commit such an offense. 
(f)  Any person in violation of this section shall be guilty of the offense of loitering for the purpose of committing a sexual act for hire. 
(Ord. No. 11-0894, Exh. A, 10-5-11; Ord. No. 17-0211, 3-1-17) 
Sec. 46-143. - For purposes of engaging in drug-related activity. 
(a)  Legislative findings and intent. 
(1)  The board of commissioners finds that the increase throughout the county of loitering in public places for the purposes of unlawful drug-related activity, or in effect, "open air" drug dealing, has become extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses. This activity has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places, but also to an enhanced sense of fear, intimidation and disorder. 
(2)  Loitering for purposes of unlawful drug-related activity usually includes a dominant presence of those persons engaging in such activity as they approach pedestrians and persons in vehicles. Such activity also encourages the presence of vehicle and pedestrian traffic for the purpose of unlawful drug-related activity in and out of residential areas, to or from motor vehicles or in parking lots. Such presence carries with it an implicit threat to visitors and residents to avoid the use of these public places. The avoidance of such places by law-abiding citizens leads, in turn, to an increased opportunity for the unlawful criminal activity and furthers the decay of the neighborhood. 
(3)  The county has a strong interest in ensuring that citizens feel safe in their neighborhoods, in safeguarding the economic vitality of its business districts, and in preserving peace and order in public places for their intended purposes. 
(4)  This section is not intended to limit any person from exercising their right to assemble or engage in any other constitutionally protected activity. This section applies to all persons with the requisite intent to induce another to engage in unlawful drug-related activity. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter, as defined in section 46-141, in or near any thoroughfare, place open to the public, or any public or private place in order to induce, entice, solicit or procure another to engage in unlawful drug-related activity. 
(1)  "Unlawful drug-related activity" means conduct which constitutes an offense defined in O.C.G.A. tit. 16, ch. 13, as amended; conduct which constitutes complicity to commit such an offense by, for example, acting as a lookout; or conduct which constitutes conspiracy to commit such an offense. 
(c)  A police officer who observes a person loitering under circumstances that provide the officer with an articulable suspicion to believe unlawful drug-related activity is occurring or has occurred may detain the individual for the purpose of investigating whether the person is in violation of this section. 
(d)  A police officer may not detain an individual under this section unless both of the following elements are satisfied: 
(1)  The person engages in one or more of the following behaviors: 
a.  The person passes or receives from a passer-by, bystander or person in a motor vehicle money, objects having characteristics consistent with controlled substances, and/or an envelope, bag or other container that could reasonably contain such objects or money; 
b.  The person conceals or attempts to conceal an object having characteristics consistent with controlled substances and/or an envelope, bag, clear plastic baggie or other container that could reasonably contain such objects; 
c.  The person flees or obscures himself upon seeing law enforcement officers; 
d.  The person communicates the fact that law enforcement officers are in the vicinity to another person in a manner that suggests that the communication is a warning; or 
e.  The officer observes the person in possession of any instrument or object that is designed or marketed as useful primarily for one or more of the following purposes: 
1.  To inject, ingest, inhale or otherwise introduce marijuana or a controlled substance into the human body; 
2.  To enhance the effect of marijuana or a controlled substance on the human body; 
3.  To test the strength, effectiveness, or purity of marijuana or a controlled substance; 
4.  To process or prepare marijuana or a controlled substance for introduction into the human body; 
5.  To conceal any quantity of marijuana or a controlled substance; or 
6.  To contain or hold marijuana or a controlled substance while it is being introduced into the human body. 
(2)  One of the following factors applies: 
a.  The officer is aware that, within the preceding three years, the person has been convicted of an offense defined in O.C.G.A. tit. 16, ch. 13, or of complicity to commit such an offense, or of conspiracy to commit such an offense with in the preceding three years; 
b.  The officer has knowledge of a specific reliable tip concerning unlawful drug-related activity at a specific location, and the person who is found loitering is doing so at a time, in a place or in a manner that is otherwise consistent with the details provided in the tip; 
c.  The person is loitering in an area that has been designated a notorious drug-related activity area as defined in subsection (g), below; 
d.  The person is in an area where he is prohibited by court order from being, and the officer is aware of the court order; 
e.  The officer knows that the person has been previously convicted of loitering with the intention of engaging in unlawful drug-related activity under this section; or 
f.  Any vehicle the person has approached or communicated through is registered to an individual who has been convicted of an unlawful drug-related activity in the previous three years, and the officer is aware of that fact. 
(e)  No arrest may be made for a violation of this section unless the arresting officer first affords the person an opportunity to explain the person's presence and conduct, unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable to afford such an opportunity, and no one shall be convicted of violating this section if it appears at trial that the explanation given at the scene was true and disclosed a lawful purpose. 
(f)  If a police officer who detains a person pursuant to this section has an articulable suspicion to believe that the person is in violation of this section, the officer may order the person to immediately leave the location and to remain at least 500 feet away from the location for at least five hours. In the event that person refuses to comply with such an order, the police officer may arrest the person and charge him with a violation of this section. 
(g)  The board of commissioners may, by written directive and after consultation with the chief of police, clearly and publicly designate areas of the unincorporated county that are frequently associated with excessive incidents of drug-related offenses, including offenses involving controlled substances (as defined in O.C.G.A. tit. 16, ch. 13) or marijuana. The chief of police shall file such designations with the clerk to the board of commissioners and with the clerk of the superior court. Prior to recommending such a determination under this subsection, the chief of police shall consult, as he or she deems appropriate, with persons who are knowledgeable about the effects of drug-related activity in areas in which this section may be enforced. Such persons may include, but need not be limited to, members of the department of police with special training or experience related to drug-related activity; other personnel of that department with particular knowledge of drug-related activities in the proposed designated area; appointed and elected officials of the area; and community based organizations. The chief of police shall develop and implement procedures for the bi-annual review and update of any designations made under this subsection. 
(h)  Severability. If any portion of this section or the application thereof shall be held invalid or unconstitutional, the other provisions of this section shall not be affected, and to this end the provisions of this section are declared to be severable.

Note— See the editor's note to Div. 2. 

Sec. 46-171. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Burglar alarm system means any assembly of equipment or device, whether mechanical or electrical, arranged or designed to signal by any means the occurrence of an illegal entry into the premises or any other activity requiring urgent police attention and to which the police department may reasonably be expected to respond; provided, however, that this definition does not include alarm systems installed exclusively for the purpose of signaling a robbery, a fire or a medical emergency, and does not include any alarm system installed in a motor vehicle. 
Burglar alarm user means the person or other entity which owns, leases, rents, manages, possesses or has primary control over the premises in which a burglar alarm system is installed or maintained. 
Chief of police means the Chief of the Fulton County Police Department or his designee. 
False alarm means the activation of a signal from a burglar alarm system which elicits a response from the police department when there is in fact no emergency or actual or threatened criminal activity necessitating such a response. This definition includes, without being limited to, any burglar alarm system signal activated as a result of weather, negligence, accident, mechanical failure, electrical failure, electrical surge, signals activated intentionally in nonemergency situations and signals activated where the actual cause of such activation is unknown. There is a rebuttable presumption that an activated burglar alarm system signal is a false alarm if the responding police personnel, after following normal police procedures in their response and investigation, find no evidence of unauthorized entry, criminal activity or other emergency. An activated burglar alarm system signal shall not be considered a false alarm if: 
(1)  The police department is notified to cancel its response by the burglar alarm user or the burglar alarm user's monitoring agent prior to the time police personnel arrive at the premises; 
(2)  The burglar alarm system signal was intentionally activated by an individual based upon a reasonable belief that an emergency or actual or threatened criminal activity requiring immediate police response existed; 
(3)  The burglar alarm system signal was activated by lightening or other act of nature resulting in an electrical surge which causes physical damage to the burglar alarm system and which damage is evidenced by the written report of a licensed burglar alarm system contractor who conducted an inspection of the system at the premises and personally observed such physical damage; or 
(4)  The burglar alarm system combines both burglar and fire alarm functions and the alarm user demonstrates that the system signal was activated by the fire alarm portion of the system. 
Police department means the Fulton County Police Department. 
Premises means the building or structure or any portion of a building or structure in which there is installed or maintained a burglar alarm system.

Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 46-172. - Legislative findings and purposes of division. 
The board of commissioners finds that police response to false burglar alarms creates additional risks to public safety by diverting limited law enforcement resources away from both real emergencies and normal patrol activities intended and designed to prevent criminal acts. Therefore, the purpose of this division is to promote public safety by making burglar alarm users in the unincorporated areas of Fulton County directly responsible for preventing false alarms. 
(Ord. No. 97-0145, § 1(27-1-4(a)), 1-22-97) 
Sec. 46-173. - Registration of burglar alarm systems.

(1)  The complete name, address and phone number of the burglar alarm user; 
(2)  The names of all persons authorized to enter the premises and deactivate the burglar alarm system signal as well as all phone numbers at which such persons can be reached; 
(3)  The name and telephone number of the burglar alarm user's monitoring agent, if any; and 
(4)  If known, the name and telephone number of the person or entity which installed the burglar alarm system. 
(b)  Any changes in the information set forth in subsection (a) of this section must be reported to the chief of police within five business days. Burglar alarm users utilizing burglar alarm systems installed prior to the effective date of this division (January 22, 1997) shall provide the information set forth in subsection (a) of this section to the chief of police no later than 60 days following such effective date, unless sooner requested in writing by the chief of police. 
(c)  The registration requirements of this subsection shall not apply where the burglar alarm system is installed in premises used exclusively for residential purposes; provided, however, upon the occurrence of the third false alarm within any calendar year at any such premises used exclusively for residential purposes, the chief of police is authorized to require in writing that the burglar alarm user comply with the registration requirements within five business days.

(2)  For the fourth and each subsequent false alarm that occurs at the same premises within any calendar year, a fine shall be assessed in the amount of $100.00 for each false alarm. 
(3)  For all other violations of this division, not including false alarms, a fine shall be assessed in the amount of $100.00.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 50-1. - Legal authority. 
Providing parks and recreational facilities has been an accepted function of Fulton County for decades. Although the county was allowed to purchase and construct recreational facilities, the county, from 1952 to 1967, was not permitted to conduct recreation programs with its own employees. The 1967 general assembly adopted an amendment authorizing Fulton County to conduct recreational activities in unincorporated areas with county personnel. Also, in accordance with the constitutional amendments approved by the voters in 1966, the county is authorized to provide 50 percent of the annual cost of recreational programs within municipalities having less than 5,000 inhabitants. The appropriation is not to exceed $5,000.00 annually for each municipality and must be matched with funds from the municipality. 
(Code 1983, § 32-1-1) 
Sec. 50-2. - Park acquisition program. 
(a)  Aware of its growing responsibilities in the area of parks and recreation, the county commission adopted the Fulton County Park Plan in March 1967. The park plan presents a program that should adequately provide the residents of Fulton County with park facilities necessary for their physical, mental, and moral health. As a general guide the county intends to provide parks on the basis of need, population density, interest, availability of land, aesthetics, financial resources, and to consider the utility of facilities provided by private agencies, institutions, and commercial recreation enterprises. In order to provide a well-balanced recreational program which will satisfy the needs of citizens of all ages and interests, the county envisions the development of three basic types of parks: playlot, neighborhood park and playground, and county regional parks. 
(1)  Playlots. Playlots are small areas intended for the use of preschool age children who live in large apartment developments. Individual lots will vary between 2,000 and 5,000 square feet in size and will be located within one block of a resident population of between 300 and 700 people. Suggested facilities for these areas would include swings, slides, sandboxes, and protective fencing. 
(2)  Neighborhood parks and playgrounds. The purpose of the neighborhood park is to serve the recreational demands of an entire neighborhood and should range in size between eight and 15 acres. A variety of facilities will be provided so that all members of the family can enjoy the park. Thus, playground apparatus including swings, slides, and play sculpture will be available for children of elementary school age. Large areas will be reserved for baseball, football, soccer, basketball, handball, tennis, and kite flying for use by teenagers and adults. Elderly citizens can enjoy paths and trails and other serene natural areas. 
(3)  County regional parks. The county regional park should provide a minimum recreational area of 25 acres for large gatherings, picnics, and organized sports activities. Picnic facilities, athletic fields, lighted tennis courts, hiking trails, and a golf course will be key features of the county parks. 
(b)  Other types of recreational properties may be acquired and developed as the need and availability dictates. 
(Code 1983, § 32-1-2) 
Sec. 50-3. - Cooperation and assistance with other public jurisdictions. 
(a)  It is the intention of Fulton County to provide suitable recreational facilities in the unincorporated areas of the county and to make these available for use by all county residents. The county park system will be coordinated with the general plans and the park and recreation plans of each of the cities within the county, including the City of Atlanta, as well as with plans of other counties in the metropolitan area, State of Georgia, county board of education, and any other recreational organization which has an interest in park facilities. 
(b)  To strengthen and encourage the development of recreational facilities in those municipalities with less than 5,000 population located within the county. Fulton County will provide matching funds up to $5,000.00 annually for each municipality. In order to qualify for county assistance the municipalities must submit a written request to the county commission. The request must include the following: 
(1)  The request should indicate the amount desired, the program contemplated, and should be accompanied by the total estimated amount the municipality intends to spend on parks and recreation activities and facilities for the coming year. 
(2)  The request should be in the form of a resolution of the municipality's governing body and must be submitted no later than two months prior to the beginning of the county's fiscal year. 
(3)  The resolution shall also include a statement indicating that the money requested shall be used only on bona fide parks and recreation programs and facilities available to the general public of that municipality. 
(4)  The county will determine priorities which it will support on the basis of need and capital expenditures such as purchases of land and equipment. 
(5)  If approved by the county commission, the county may advance 50 percent of the matching funds at the beginning of the county's fiscal year if evidence of need is submitted by the municipality. 
(6)  The remaining 50 percent of the grant will be paid immediately following a resolution passed by the municipality's governing body which confirms the total amount spent for parks and recreation and justifies the additional 50 percent. All unspent county matching funds shall be returned to the county. In the event the municipality spends more on parks and recreation than was originally estimated and its request of matching funds was less than $5,000.00, the county commission at their discretion may supplement the appropriation to the maximum of $5,000.00. The county reserves the right to request detailed supporting data on parks and recreation expenditures. 
(7)  In calculating the county's contribution to a municipality for park development and recreation purposes, the value of services rendered by the county department of public works in connection with park development shall be taken into consideration. 
(Code 1983, § 32-1-3) 
Sec. 50-4. - Administrative procedure for the planning, development, construction, and operation of county parks. 
(a)  The effectiveness of the county's park and recreation system is dependent upon the cooperation and work of the individuals, groups, and department involved. 
(b)  The county manager through the county commission is charged with the responsibility of executing the county's park plan, overseeing its operation, and recommending necessary action. Within the organizational framework of the county, the department of planning and community development is assigned the task of developing, revising, and updating the master park plan in light of population data, existing parks, and location of potential sites. The department of planning and community development also is responsible for the design and layout of parks, unless the services of consultants are authorized, and for recommending stages and areas of park development. 
(c)  The construction and maintenance of the county park system is the responsibility of the department of planning and community development. In parks which require special construction or maintenance, the county may adopt alternatives. 
(d)  The county does not plan or anticipate an elaborate supervised recreational program, nor does it intend to duplicate services provided by other groups or municipalities. The operation of supervised recreational programs in county parks may be assigned to the City of Atlanta or other municipalities located within the county, the county board of education, civic groups, or other nonprofit organizations, eleemosynary institutions, or may be performed by county forces. It is the responsibility of the county manager to receive plans and proposals for the operation of all park facilities and to recommend a program to the county commission.
