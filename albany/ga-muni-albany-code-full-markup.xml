         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Albany, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1975 Code, the 1985 Code as supplemented through Ord. No. 07-111, adopted April 24, 2007, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of city commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1975 Code, the 1985 Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Jim Jenkins, Code Attorney, and Shelly Hayes, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Alfred D. Lott and city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  --- (1) --- 
                  Editor's note— Printed herein is the Charter of the City of Albany, as enacted by 1923 Ga. Laws (Act No. 303), page 370. Amendments are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original. Any provisions regarding the severability, repealer, jurat, affidavit or notice of publication, publication date, or the adoption or effective date of the ordinance or Act have been omitted. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. The style used for headings and catchlines has been made uniform and consistent with those appearing in the Code. Additions made for clarity, such as consistent state statute citations and catchline modifications, are indicated by brackets. Each section of the original Act began with the prefatory language "[b]e it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, and it is hereby enacted by authority of the same," or "[b]e it further enacted that." At the editor's discretion, this prefatory language has been omitted from this printing. 

                  Sec. 1. - Corporate name; powers generally.

                  Sec. 3. - Board of city commissioners generally; terms. 
                  The municipal government shall consist of a mayor, who shall be also a member of the board of 
                  city commissioners, and shall be elected from the city at large by all the voters of said city; one commissioner from each of the five [six] wards of the city as said wards now or may hereafter exist, all of whom shall be elected from the city at large by all the voters of said city. 
                  All of said commissioners, including the mayor, shall hold office for a term of two years from the second Monday in January in each year next following the dates of their election, and until their successors are elected and qualified. 
                  The office of mayor pro tem shall be by rotation among the commissioners in the following order: 
                  The commissioner from Ward IV for the commission year 2005 and every sixth year thereafter; the commissioner from Ward V for the commission year 2006 and every sixth year thereafter; the commissioner from Ward VI for the commission year 2007 and every sixth year thereafter; the commissioner from Ward I for the commission year 2008 and every sixth year thereafter; the commissioner for Ward II for the commission year 2009 and every sixth year thereafter; and the commissioner for Ward III for the commission year 2010 and every sixth year thereafter. 
                  The term "commission year" as used herein means the period commencing on the second Monday in January of the year, and terminating on the second Monday of January of the following year. 
                  In the event any commissioner declines to serve as mayor pro tem, then the commissioner next in line shall succeed to the position of mayor pro tem. 
                  (a)  Applicability; regular elections. The mayor and the three commissioners from the first, fourth, and sixth wards in office on January 1, 1999, shall complete the two-year terms for which they were elected on the second Monday in January, 2000, and when their successors are elected and qualified. On the Tuesday next following the first Monday in November, 1999, a successor mayor and successor commissioners from the first, fourth, and sixth wards shall be elected for terms of four years and until their successors are elected and qualified, taking office on the second Monday in January, 2000. Their successors shall be elected on the Tuesday next following the first Monday in November, 2003, and quadrennially thereafter, taking office on the second Monday in the January next following their election for terms of four years and until their successors are elected and qualified. 
                  (b)  Eligibility of commissioners; qualifications. No person shall be eligible to represent any ward unless he has been a bona fide resident thereof at least three months prior to the election at which he offers himself as a candidate. If any commissioner shall remove his domicile from his ward during his term of office, this shall operate to cause a vacancy in the office of commissioner from that ward. The mayor and mayor pro tem. may reside in any ward. 
                  Each member of said board of city commissioners shall have been a resident of the City of Albany, or a resident of any new area taken into the city, for a period of two years immediately prior to the date as of which he is entitled to qualify; at least 21 years of age, and shall continue a bona fide resident of Albany during his term of office. 
                  (c)  Filling of vacancies. A vacancy (which shall exist in cases of death, removal from the city or ward as hereinbefore provided, resignation, unexcused absence from board meetings, as hereinafter provided) occurring on the said board, shall be filled for the unexpired term at an election by the mayor and remaining members of said board, at least four members participating in the election, provided, at the time of such vacancy it is not exceeding six months before the expiration of said commissioner's term of office. If, however, said unexpired term is longer than six months from the date of such vacancy, the board shall, within 15 days, order an election, and such election shall be held and managed in the same manner as hereinafter provided for said elections, at which special election a successor for the unexpired term caused by said vacancy shall be elected. 
                  (d)  Organizational meeting; powers and duties of mayor generally. The board of city commissioners shall organize on the second Monday in January of each even numbered year. At the organizational meeting on the second Monday in January 2014, and on the second Monday in January every two years thereafter, the Board shall by resolution declare the winners of the elections held the preceding November, for a term of four years and until their respective successor is elected and qualified. 
                  The mayor shall preside at all meetings of the commission, and in addition to all other duties heretofore given him or imposed upon the office of mayor by charter authority of the General Assembly of Georgia, and/or municipal ordinance of the board of city commissioners of the City of Albany, Georgia, shall have a voice in all proceedings before the board, and shall have a vote in each and all matters and proceedings whatsoever, but not veto. He shall have all rights, powers and privileges now or hereafter conferred by law, charter, or valid municipal ordinance as said mayor and/or commissioner. Whenever from any cause the mayor shall be absent, the mayor pro tem shall act. The mayor pro tem shall have a voice in all proceedings before the board, and shall have a vote in each and all matters whatsoever. 
                  A member of the board of city commissioners shall be incompetent to hold any other municipal office during the term of office for which he was chosen: Provided, that nothing herein shall render him ineligible to be elected during said term, to serve in a term immediately succeeding said term, but nothing in this section shall apply to any municipal office which is filled by appointment of the mayor. 
                  The mayor shall be recognized as the official head of the city by the courts for the purposes of service of process and by the Governor and Federal authorities, for military and ceremonial functions. 
                  In time of danger or emergency, the mayor may, with consent of two commissioners, take command of the police and govern the city by proclamation and maintain order and enforce laws. 
                  The mayor shall have authority to veto any line item in any budget adopted by the board of commissioners by an instrument in writing filed with the city clerk within ten days after the adoption of said budget. Within 24 hours after the filing of such veto, the city clerk shall give written notice of said veto to each member of the board of commissioners and to the city manager, and the board of commissioners may not later than the second regular meeting of the board of commissioners which occurs after the filing of said veto, overrule the veto of the mayor by motion adopted by four votes. If said veto is overruled, the budget shall stand as adopted; if said veto shall not be so overruled, said budget shall stand as if passed without the item vetoed. 
                  (e)  Salaries. Each member of the board of commissioners of the City of Albany, except the mayor, shall receive a salary of $15,000.00 per annum, payable in monthly installments on the first day of each month. The mayor of the City of Albany shall receive a salary of $25,000.00 per annum, payable in monthly installments on the first day of each month. 
                  (f)  Procedures of board; oath. All appointments and elections by the board of city commissioners shall be viva voce and the vote recorded on the minutes of the board. The commission may determine its own rules of procedure, and shall have power to punish by execution and attachment for contempt of the board in a penalty not to exceed $50.00 or confinement in the city's prison or guardhouse not exceeding 30 days, either or both in their discretion and may coerce the payment of said fines by imprisonment, and in this connection to pass all ordinances necessary in the premises, and shall have the power to adopt parliamentary rules for the conduct of business, and the board shall keep minutes of the proceedings of and before said board; a majority of the board shall constitute a quorum to do business, but less than a majority may adjourn a meeting to a future day certain. 
                  All valid ordinances of the City of Albany existing and in force at the date upon which this Act takes effect with reference to procedure before the mayor and council shall continue of force and apply where applicable to procedure before the board until by the board altered or repealed. Each commissioner shall before qualifying and entering upon the discharge of his duties take and subscribe upon the minutes of the board the following oath, to-wit: 
                  I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully and uprightly demean myself as a member of the board of city commissioners of the City of Albany during my continuance in office; that I will to the utmost of my skill and ability promote the interest and prosperity of the city, and that I will not willfully and knowingly use or be the cause of using tyrannical means toward any citizen or portions of citizens of the city, so help me God. 
                  (g)  Impeachment. The board of city commissioners shall provide by ordinance for the impeachment and trial of any member of the board, who upon conviction of malpractice in office or any willful neglect or abuse the powers and duties of the same, shall be dismissed from office. Reasonable notice and fair hearing shall be given the accused. 
                  (h)  Special meetings; meetings to be public; absence of members. The mayor or any member of the commission, or the city manager may call a special meeting of the commission at any time upon 24 hours written notice of the call to each member, such notice to be served in person or left at the member's residence or place of business, or a special meeting may be had at any time provided all the members attend or answer the roll call. All meetings of the board of city commissioners shall be public and any citizen may have access to the minutes of the board and other municipal records at all reasonable times. For each unexcused absence of a commissioner from the regular meeting of the commission there shall be deducted from the pay of such commissioner a sum equal to two per cent of the annual salary of the commissioner. The city commission shall have the power, in its discretion, upon motion passed by a majority of those present and voting, to excuse absences of commissioners from regular meetings of the commission on account of illness or absence from the city on city business, and in addition shall have the power, in its discretion, upon motion passed by a majority of those present and voting, to excuse one additional absence each year without cause. Absence from five consecutive regular meetings whether excused or unexcused shall operate to vacate the office of a commissioner unless said cumulative absence is excused by the commission by resolution setting forth the reason therefor and entered upon the minutes of the board. 
                  (i)  Election of officers; terms; rights reserved; acceptance of gifts, etc. The board of city commissioners shall on the second Monday in January of 2014, and on the second Monday in January every two years thereafter, elect a city manager, a city attorney and such assistant city attorney(s) it shall deem appropriate, a city clerk, an assistant city clerk, and at the pleasure of the board, may elect a chief judge for the municipal court for Albany and an associate judge or such part-time, full-time, or stand-by judges as it shall deem appropriate.

                  Editor's note— Ordinance No. 96-325, adopted Oct. 22, 1996 (1997 Ga. Laws, p. 4791, § 1), amended section 3 of the Charter and Chapter 2 of the 1985 City Code by providing for the appointment of an Assistant city clerk. The ordinance did not provide specific language implementing this amendment into the Charter or City Code, nor did it designate a specific location in the Charter or City Code for placement of language implementing the amendment. Furthermore, pursuant to the decision in Paige v. Gray, 437 F. Supp. 137 (M.D. Ga. 1977), the Albany board of commissioners was ordered to consist of seven commissioners, six of whom would reside in and be elected only by the voters of each of the six wards as reapportioned in the manner according to the court's six-ward plan, and one of whom would be the mayor. The commissioner would be able to reside anywhere in the city and would be elected by all the voters of the city. The office of mayor pro-tem, if deemed necessary and desirable by the commissioners, would be filled by vote of all the commissioners with a term of "one year and until his successor [was] elected and qualified." The court retained jurisdiction of this case.

                  Editor's note— 1974 Ga. Laws, p. 4017, § 1 (Ord. No. 1901, § I, 7-24-1973), purported to amend section 25(13) of the original Act by adding text to the end of it. However, the editor has determined that a scrivener's error occurred in listing which material of the original Act was meant to be amended by the amending ordinance, because section 25 of the original Act did not contain any sub-paragraphs and sub-paragraph (13) of section 24 of the original Act contained a similar subject matter as the amending material appearing in amending ordinance. Thus, at the editor's discretion, sub-paragraph (13) of section 24 has been amended by the provision appearing in 1974 Ga. Laws, p. 4017, § 1 (Ord. No. 1901, § I, 7-24-1973).

The board of city commissioners may, in the interest of public health, safety, order, convenience, comfort, prosperity, or general welfare, adopt by ordinance a plan or plans for the districting or zoning of the city for the purpose of regulating the location of trades, industries, apartment-houses, dwellings, or other uses of property; or for the purpose of regulating the height of the buildings, fences, or other structures; or the area or dimensions of lots or of the yards used in connection with buildings or other structures; or for the purpose of regulating the alignment of buildings or other structures near street frontages.

                  (c)  Rights of parties to pending litigation protected.

                  (9)  Sewers; extension of gas, water, etc. To construct or extend sewers in any of the streets, alleys or ways of said city or contiguous territory that may hereafter be incorporated, to assess such part of the cost of the same on the real estate abutting in the street, way or alley in which the same may be extended, according to frontage as may seem just and reasonable, and to enforce the payment of same by execution against the abutting real estate and the owner thereof. Before the board of [city] commissioners shall adopt any ordinance providing for said improvements where part of the cost is to be assessed against the property owner as above provided, written notice of the date and time of the meeting of the public works committee of the board of [city] commissioners at which such ordinance will be considered shall be given each affected property owner by mailing said notice to the address of such property owner as shown on the last city property tax return of such property owner, such notice to be placed in the United States mail at least 30 days prior to said meeting. The mailing of the notice above described in the manner above provided shall constitute sufficient notice. If the ordinance providing for such improvements shall receive the unanimous vote of the board of [city] commissioners, and if the board of city commissioners shall not elect to hold the cost of such improvement in abeyance and collect it as a sewer connection charge as hereafter provided, the consent of the property owners shall not be required as a condition to the construction of said improvements or to the assessment of the property owners for the cost or portions of the cost thereof; but if such ordinance shall not receive the unanimous vote of the board of [city] commissioners, the consent of 51 percent or more of the property owners to be assess shall be required. 
                  In determining whether the requisite 51 percent or more of the property owners to be assessed has been obtained, an affirmative expression of such consent must be received in writing, signed by the property owner. 
                  Said assessments shall be levied only on real estate which is specially benefited by the sewer; that is, on real estate which does not abut any street, alley, or way which already has a sewer capable of adequately serving said real estate, so that where there is "already a sewer in a street, alley or way, abutting any real estate, and said sewer is capable of adequately serving said real estate, the owner and said real estate shall not again be assessed for the construction or extension of a sewer, even though such sewer is constructed or extended in a street, alley or way abutting the real estate. The decision of the board of city commissioners as to adequacy shall be final. 
                  In determining whether or not 51 percent of the property owners have consented, property owners who will not be assessed on account of the foregoing paragraph shall be excluded and shall not be considered, effective from the date of the passage of the ordinance making the assessment, and having the same priority. 
                  To an execution issued under this paragraph the defendant shall have the right to file an affidavit, denying that the whole or any part of the amount for which execution issued is due and stating what amount he admits to be due; which shall be paid or collected before the affidavit is received, and the affidavit shall be received for the balance, and all such affidavits shall be returned to the Superior Court of Dougherty County and there be tried and determined as in cases of illegality, subject to all the pains and penalties provided for in such cases of illegality for delay. The executions herein provided shall be enforced as in case of executions for paving and the assessment shall have the same lien. 
                  And in all cases where street paving or repairing is contemplated on any street or highway in the city in which mains, sewers, gas pipes, or electric wiring pipes are laid, or are to be laid, the city shall have the power by a majority vote of the board of commissioners and without the consent of the property owners to extend such mains, sewers, gas pipes, or electric wiring pipes from the main line to the property line to thereafter avoid the necessity of tearing up the paving to make house connections and to assess and collect the cost of making such property line extension against the property to which said connection is made. The payment of such assessments shall be enforced in the manner in which assessments in cases of street paving are enforced. [parenthetical citation omitted] 
                  Whenever the construction or extension of a sanitary sewer does not receive the approval of 51 percent or more of the property owners to be assessed, and the unanimous vote of the board of city commissioners cannot be obtained to proceed with such construction or extension and to assess the same as heretofore provided, the board of city commissioners may nevertheless, by vote of four or more commissioners, order the sewer constructed or extended, and order the costs thereof to be apportioned and assessed against the abutting property owners in the same manner as herein provided in the case of other assessments, the payment thereof to be held in abeyance and collected as an additional sewer connection charge, in addition to all other connection charges and fees, at the time the property owner connects to the sewer. In such case execution shall issue and shall be recorded, and the assessment shall constitute the same lien as herein provided for other sewer construction and extension costs, dating from the adoption of the ordinance providing therefor, but payment shall not be required or demanded until the property owner connects to the sewer. The board of commissioners shall have the power to authorize payment of such costs, when the same becomes due upon connection to the system, in future installments and in such manner and at such rate of interest, not to exceed the maximum lawful rate, as it shall determine. In such case the costs shall continue to be a lien until paid in full, with all due interest. 
                  Provided, however, that if any lot or lots is so situated that the installation of the sewer line does not extend the full distance of the frontage of said lot or lots abutting the street, way, alley or easement, thereupon the city commissioners are authorized to assess the entire frontage of the lot or lots, the proportionate share of the costs of said sewer line, and provided further, that in such a case the sewer line shall be extended along frontage abutting street, way, alley or easement, to such a point as will afford the owner of the real estate the most practical and economical connection to the sewer line. [parenthetical citation omitted] 
                  In addition to all other authority which the City of Albany has to construct or extend sanitary sewers and to provide for the recovery of the cost thereof, the City of Albany shall have the right, by a majority vote of the board of commissioners (four votes), without the consent of the property owners, to construct or extend sanitary sewers, and to recover the cost of construction through tapping fees, to be computed as follows: 
                  The director of the public works department shall keep an accurate record of the cost of construction of such sanitary sewer line, and, upon completion, shall make an official determination of the entire cost thereof. Every person desiring to tap on to said line and receive service therefrom shall pay, at the time of tapping on, a tapping fee which shall be the greater of the following sums: 
                  (1)  A fraction of the entire cost of construction as finally determined by the public works director, the enumerator of which shall be the number of feet of property owned by said user abutting on said sanitary sewer line, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of the front footage of property abutting both sides of the sanitary sewer line; or 
                  (2)  A fraction of such construction cost, the enumerator of which shall be the estimated demand upon such line by the user in terms of gallons per minute, as determined by or under the direction of the public works director, and the denominator of which shall be the total capacity of said sanitary sewer line in terms of gallons per minute, as determined by the public works director. 
                  (10)  Regulate machinery.

                  Editor's note— Subsection 2 of the original Act was declared unconstitutional by the Georgia Supreme Court in Reynolds v. Brosnan, 170 Ga. 773, 154 S.E. 264 (1930). Nevertheless, the text of the subsection has been included in this printing for purposes of authenticity. In addition, 1970 Ga. Laws (Act No. 986), p. 2575, § I, purported to strike the text of sub-paragraph (5) of section 35 of the original Act and replace it with a new sub-paragraph (5). However, the editor has determined that a scrivener's error occurred in describing which material of the original Act was meant to be amended by the 1970 Act, because section 35 of the original Act did not contain any sub-paragraphs and sub-paragraph (5) of section 34 of the original Act contained a similar subject matter as the amending material appearing in 1970 Act. Thus, at the editor's discretion, sub-paragraph (5) of section 34 has been amended by the provision appearing in 1970 Ga. Laws (Act No. 986), p. 2575, § I. Furthermore, the Georgia Assembly enacted the provisions of 1929 Ga. Laws (Act No. 245), p. 797, § 3, as amending the original Act, but they did not list any specific location for these amendatory provisions within the original Act relative to the other sections. Placement of these amendatory provisions and designation of them as subsections (8-A)(a)—(c) of section 34 was at the discretion of the editor. Furthermore, the Georgia Assembly enacted a provision of 1941 Ga. Laws (Act No. 24), p. 1010, § 2, as amending section 34 of the original Act, but they did not list any specific location for this amendatory provision within the original Act relative to the other subsections. Placement of this amendatory provision and designation of it as subsection (15) of section 34 was at the discretion of the editor. Moreover, the Georgia Assembly enacted a provision of 1964 Ga. Laws (Act No. 521), p. 2009, § 1 as a new subsection under section 34 of the original Act, but they did not provide any specific designation for this new subsection within the original Act relative to the other 15 subsections existing at that time. The General Assembly later repealed and replaced this provision with another through Ord. No. 80-109, § 1, adopted 2-12-80 (1981 Ga. Laws (Act No. 521), p. 5046, § 1), but designated the new provision as subsection 22 of section 34. Furthermore, the Georgia Assembly enacted a provision of Ord. No. 1869, § 1, adopted May 22, 1973 (1974 Ga. Laws, p. 4009, § 1) as an amendment to section 34 of the original Act, and only designated that it be numbered as subsection 18, "or the number next following the last number of said section 34 as amended." Designation of this amendatory provision as subsection (21) of section 34 was at the discretion of the editor. 
                  Sec. 35. - Levy and sale of property outside corporate limits. 
                  In any case where the defendant in execution has no property within the City of Albany, then and in that event any execution issued by authority of the city for the enforcement of the payment of any sum for taxes, special assessments, fines or otherwise, may be levied and enforced in any county in the state in which property of the defendant may be found and for such purpose the mayor or treasurer shall cause such execution to be directed to any sheriff or constable of the state, and it shall be the duty of any levying officer into whose hands said execution may be placed to promptly enforce the same in the same manner as other executions are enforced with reference to levy, advertisement and sale. 
                  Sec. 36. - Municipal abattoirs; inspection of meats. 
                  The City of Albany shall have power and authority to own and operate for reasonable profit a municipal abattoir at any place within its corporate limits proper, or its police jurisdiction, to fix and collect regular fees for the slaughter of cattle, hogs, sheep or other meat intended for human consumption therein; to prescribe any and all regulations and rules governing the operation of said abattoir and the reception of stock therein, and in connection with the operation of same shall have the power to fully regulate or prohibit any other abattoir or slaughter house or similar place where cattle or other meat is slaughtered for market within its corporate and police limits, and to prescribe the location and the manner and kind of construction of the same; or said city shall have the power to prohibit the operation of any abattoir, slaughter house or other place where stock is slaughtered within the corporate and police limits; and in connection with the said municipal abattoir, said city shall have the power to prohibit by penal ordinance the sale or having on hand for sale, within its corporate or police limits, any fresh or green meats, not slaughtered in its abattoir, unless it has been slaughtered in an abattoir or similar place of equal facilities and methods as that of the city's or of such standard as the city may by ordinance prescribe, or unless it bears valid and satisfactory evidence of a state or federal favorable inspection; and said city shall have the power to provide for rigid inspection of all green or fresh meats sold or offered for sale or on hand for sale, within the city's corporate or police limits, so as to insure a strict conformity to its laws and ordinances governing the introduction thereof into the city; and shall have the power to confiscate and destroy all tainted meats found on the market of the city, and to confiscate all meats found within said limits brought in contrary to the laws and ordinances of the city. 
                  Sec. 37. - Enumeration of powers not restrictive. 
                  The enumeration of power contained in this Act shall not be construed as restrictive, but the City of Albany and its municipal authorities may exercise all powers, rights and jurisdictions as they might if such enumerations were not made, and the board of city commissioners may pass all laws and ordinances, rules and regulations they may deem needful and proper for the general welfare of said city, and where, under this charter, rights are conferred or powers granted, but the manner of exercising them is not fully prescribed the board of city commissioners may prescribe the method of exercising them, or they may prescribe additional regulations and modes of procedure not repugnant to the intents and purposes of this Act, nor the laws of the state. 
                  Sec. 37-A. - Municipal planning board. 
                  (a)  Creation; composition. There shall be created as part of the government of the City of Albany a board to be known as the municipal planning board, which board shall consist of not less than three and not more than seven members, to be appointed by the board of city commissioners and to have such terms (not to exceed four years) as the board of city commissioners may determine. The board shall elect one of its members chairman and shall appoint a Secretary, who may be an employee of the city. 
                  (b)  Powers; duties. The planning board shall have power to recommend or make suggestions to the board of city commissioners concerning the laying out, widening, extending and location of streets; sidewalks, and boulevards; the relief of traffic conditions; development of housing and sanitary conditions; and the establishment of zones or districts, to make suggestions concerning the use, height, area and bulk of buildings or structures; to study and propose such measures as may be advisable for the promotion of public interests, health, morals, safety, comfort, convenience and welfare of said city, and in addition thereto, shall have such additional authority as may be provided by law, or conferred upon said board by ordinances passed by the board of city commissioners of the City of Albany. 
                  (c)  Appropriation; gifts or bequests. The board of city commissioners shall make such appropriations for carrying out the work of said planning board in like manner and form as appropriations are made to other departments of said city. The municipal planning board shall have the authority to receive gifts, bequests and devises of money and property and to carry out the general purpose of same. When any gifts, bequests or devises are made to the said municipal planning board, the said board shall have full, complete and final control and disposition of same, and the said gifts shall not pass into the city treasury or otherwise be counted as part of the revenue of the city.

                  Editor's note— The Georgia legislature enacted the provisions of 1924 Ga. Laws (Act No. 331), p. 397, § 3, as amending the original 1923 Act without reference to a specific location relative to the other sections of the original 1923 Act. Placement of these provisions at Section 37-A this location, was at the discretion of the editor. This planning board has been succeeded by the Albany-Dougherty Planning commission, which was established by Ordinance No. 85-167, adopted May 30, 1985. 
                  Sec. 38. - Act of 1906 not repealed. 
                  All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act be and the same are hereby repealed; Provided, that nothing in this Act contained shall operate to effect or repeal the Act of the General Assembly of Georgia, approved August 21, 1906, entitled "An Act to provide for a system of public schools in and for the City of Albany, Dougherty County, Georgia; to empower and require the mayor and council of said city to levy and collect a special tax for the maintenance and support of same; to establish a board of education to conduct the same; to define the powers of said board; to provide for ratification of the Act by election, and for other purposes," which said Act is hereby declared to be and remain of full force and effect [1906 Ga. Laws (Act No. 548), p. 488]. 
                  Sec. 39. - Election for ratification of charter. 
                  Before this Act shall become effective the same shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the City of Albany at an election to be held for that purpose on October 8, 1923. Said election shall in all respects be held and the results declared by the mayor and council or by those discharging the duties of such, under the present rules and regulations governing ordinary city elections, provided that instead of opening the registration books 45 days prior to said election said registration books need not be opened more than 35 days prior to said election and continue open for 30 days. Those so registering and qualified to vote in said election need not register again in order to vote in the general election to be held in said city on the first Monday in December, 1923 (or any primary election therefor), but if otherwise qualified shall be deemed qualified voters in said general election. Those voters desiring to vote in favor of this Act shall have written or printed upon their ballots the words "For Commission Manager Bill," and those voters desiring to vote against this bill shall have written or printed on their ballots "Against Commission Manager Bill." If a majority of those voting in said election shall vote in favor of this bill, this bill shall, as to those Acts and things, the performance or happening of which is postponed until that date, become of force and effect on the second Monday in January, 1924, and, as to those Acts and things the performance or happening of which is required prior to said second Monday in January, 1924, shall become of force and effect at such time or times as will insure the prompt performance or happening of said Acts and things. 
                  (a)  The managers and clerks of said special election (and one alternate for each to serve in case the person designated does not act) shall be chosen by the mayor and council of the city, or those discharging the duties of such, at least three days before the election, and those favoring the adoption of the Act and those opposed thereto shall have as nearly equal representation among said managers and clerks as is possible; that is to say, if two managers are chosen from among those who favor the adoption of said Act, then two of the clerks shall be chosen from among those opposed thereto, and vice versa. And in choosing said clerks and managers, and alternates for each, said authorities shall as far as possible act upon responsible recommendations made by the chairman or committee of those citizens favoring the adoption of said Act and the chairman or committee of those citizens opposing the adoption of said Act. 
                  Sec. 39-A. - Retirement age for municipal employees. 
                  Every employed municipal officer or employee of the City of Albany shall be retired upon reaching 65 years of age; provided, that in the event municipal employees are included under the provisions of the United States Social Security Act, no municipal officer or employee who is employed at the time of such inclusion shall be retired at the age of 65 if such retirement would disqualify such person from obtaining the benefits of social security. Instead, such employee shall be allowed to continue his employment until he qualifies for social security at which time he shall be retired.

                  Editor's note— The requirement in Section 39-A mandating a retirement age for all municipal officers and employees is a prima facie violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"), 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. However, the text of this section has been printed for purposes of authenticity. 
                  Sec. 40. - Authority to insure city employees; appropriation of funds. 
                  The City of Albany shall have the power and authority to enter into contracts of insurance with any insurance company authorized to transact business in the State of Georgia, insuring the employees of the city, or any class or group of city employees, under a policy or policies of group insurance, granting annuities, hospital and sick insurance.

                  Editor's note— The Georgia legislature enacted the provisions of 1950 Ga. Laws (Act No. 595), p. 2149, § 1, as a new section amending the original 1923 Act without reference to a specific location relative to the other sections of the original 1923 Act. Placement of the provision at this location and designation of it as Section 40, was at the discretion of the editor. Section 40 of the original 1923 Act provided for the repeal of all conflicting laws. 
                  Sec. 41. - Board of city commissioners to determine type of insurance; amount, etc. 
                  The board of city commissioners is hereby vested with full and complete power and authority to determine the amount of contribution by the city for the purchase of group insurance for employees of the city, the amount and kind of insurance, what class of employees are to be included, and to determine any and all facts relating to the purchase of group insurance, and to enter into contracts accordingly.

Laws (Act No. 595), p. 2149, § 2, as a new section amending the original 1923 Act and following the section enacted by section 1 of the 1950 Act. Designation of it as Section 41, was at the discretion of the editor. Furthermore, 1981 Ga. Laws, pp. 5048, 5049, § 1 (Ord. No. 80-117, § 1, 2-26-1980) purported to amend the Charter and 1943 Ga. Laws (Act No. 105), p. 1154, by adding an amendatory provision allowing "the transfer to the City of Albany Pension Fund of the interest or equity of any newly employed city manager in any and all other employee pension trusts or funds." However, the original 1923 Act creating the Charter did not contain any amendatory provision from the 1943 Act or any subject matter concerning municipal employee pensions. Therefore, the provisions of the 1981 amendatory ordinance were not included in this printing of the Charter, at the discretion of the editor.

                  Editor's note— Printed herein is 1943 Ga. Laws (Act No. 105), page 1154. Amendments are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original. Any provisions regarding the jurat, affidavit or notice of publication, publication date, or the adoption or effective date of the ordinance or Act have been omitted. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. The style used for headings and catchlines has been made uniform and consistent with those appearing in the Code. Additions made for clarity, such as consistent state statute citations and catchline modifications, are indicated by brackets. Certain sections of the 1943 Act began with the prefatory language "[b]e it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Georgia, and it is hereby enacted by authority of the same," or "[b]e it further enacted that." At the editor's discretion, this prefatory language has been omitted from this printing.

                  The word 'Project' shall also include the acquisition, construction, improvement or modification of any property, real or personal used as air or water pollution control facilities which any federal, state, or local agency having jurisdiction in the premises shall have certified as necessary for the continued operation of the industry or industries which the same is to serve and is necessary for the public welfare. For purposes hereof, the term 'air pollution control facility' means any property used primarily to abate or control atmospheric pollution or contamination by removing, containing, altering, disposing or storing of atmospheric pollutants or contaminants if such facility is in furtherance of federal, state, or local standards for control of atmospheric pollution or contaminants. For the purpose hereof, the term `water pollution control facility' means any property used primarily to control water pollution by removing, storing, altering, or disposing of pollutants, contaminants, wastes or heat, including the necessary intercepting sewers, outfall sewers, pumping, power and other equipment, holding ponds, lagoons and their appurtenances, if such facility is in the furtherance of federal, state, or local standards for the control of water pollution."

                  Editor's note— 1975 Ga. Laws (Act No. 211), p. 3172, § 1, purported to enact a new paragraph at the end of subsection (b) of section 2 of the 1958 Ga. Laws (Act No. 260), p. 2870. However, the editor has determined that a scrivener's error occurred regarding which section of the 1958 Act the new paragraph should be added, because section 2 of the 1958 Act does not contain any subsections while section 3 of the 1958 Act contains subsections (a)—(c). Therefore, the new paragraph added by the 1975 Act was placed at the end of subsection (c) of section 3, at the discretion of the editor. Moreover, 1979 Ga. Laws (Act No. 182), p. 3639, § 1, purported to enact a new paragraph at the end of subsection (b) of section 2 of the 1958 Ga. Laws (Act No. 260), p. 2870. However, the editor has determined that a scrivener's error occurred regarding which section of the 1958 Act the new paragraph should be added, because section 2 of the 1958 Act does not contain any subsections while section 3 of the 1958 Act contains subsections (a)—(c). Therefore, the new paragraph added by the 1979 Act was placed at the end of subsection (c) of section 3, at the discretion of the editor.

The principal of and interest on such revenue bonds shall be payable and may be secured by a pledge of rents, fees, charges, and other revenues of, and by the mortgage of, all or any part of the project or projects financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of such bonds or with the proceeds of bonds called and refunded or to be called and refunded by such bond issue. The bond of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates per annum, payable at such time or times, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their date or dates, shall be payable in such medium of payment as to both principal and interest as may be determined by the Authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Authority in the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds.

                  (b)  The Authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of the principal thereof and the interest thereon, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the State. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form, or both, as the Authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest. 
                  (c)  All such bonds shall be executed with the engraved, imprinted, stamped, or otherwise reproduced facsimile of the signature of the Chairman of the Authority and the corporate seal of the Authority shall be thereunto impressed or a facsimile thereof imprinted or otherwise reproduced and attested by the manually executed signature of the Secretary-Treasurer of the Authority and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signature of said Secretary-Treasurer. In case any officer whose signature shall appear on the bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before delivery of such bonds, such signature shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until delivery, and such bonds may, nevertheless, be issued and delivered as though the person who signed or sealed such bonds had not ceased to be such officer, and any of such bonds may be executed and sealed on behalf of said Authority by such officers who may, at the time of the execution of such bonds, hold the proper offices of said Authority although on the date of such bonds or on the date of any lawful proceedings taken in connection therewith such persons may not have held such offices. 
                  (d)  All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall be and are hereby declared to be negotiable under the laws of the State of Georgia, subject to provisions for registration. 
                  (e)  The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the Authority and the proceeds derived from the sale of such bonds shall be used solely for the purpose provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds. 
                  (f)  Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. 
                  (g)  The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds and coupons which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. 
                  (h)  Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified required hereunder. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions hereof shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the Authority. 
                  (i)  The revenue bonds or obligations herein authorized to be issued shall not be deemed to constitute a debt (within the meaning of Article IX, Section VII, Paragraph I of the Constitution of the State of Georgia of 1976) of the State of Georgia, the City of Albany, the County of Dougherty, or the Authority, or a pledge of the faith and credit of said State, City, County, nor shall said State, City, or County be subject to any pecuniary liability thereon. 
                  (j)  In the discretion of the Authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the State. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the Authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insuring of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies; and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the Authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds; and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other monies be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State or of the United States to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. Any resolution adopted by the Authority or any indenture of trust, trust agreement, or other instrument executed by the Authority may contain such terms and provisions as the Authority shall approve. Such approval of the Authority shall be conclusively established by the execution of any such resolution, indenture of trust, trust agreement, or other instrument by the chairman or vice chairman of the Authority and the attestation of such execution by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Authority. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture.

The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another.

                  (c)  Each day any violation of this Code or of any ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense.

                  Abusive language means harsh, violent, profane, or derogatory language that would demean the dignity of an individual, including profanity, racial, ethnic, and sexist slurs.

                  Harassment means repeated, unwarranted verbal or physical annoyances, or unwarranted threats or unwarranted demands. 
                  (b)  Established. There is hereby established a police department civilian review board ("civilian review board") to exercise the duties and responsibilities outlined herein so that there will be a procedure to review certain complaints against law enforcement officers of the city.

                  (a)  The civilian review board shall consist of nine individuals appointed for the staggered terms listed hereafter. Once those initial terms are completed, future appointments shall be for three years. The mayor of the city shall make three appointments and each commissioner of the city shall make one appointment.

                  (a)  The civilian review board will provide a process to review certain claims that have been made against members of the city police department. The present process can be summarized as follows: 
                  (b)  The police department presently responds to citizens' complaints by having the complaint investigated by the appropriate supervisor. Once the supervisor reaches a conclusion, the supervisor's determination makes it way through the appropriate chain of command/division head. The command staff of the police department then reviews the matter. At any point in the process, an investigation can be made beyond that conducted by the supervisor or the chief of police can refer a complaint to the internal affairs office of the police department. Upon completion of the investigation, the complaining party is notified by the city police department, via telephone, e-mail or letter of its findings. 
                  (c)  Given that the purpose of this board is to assure accountability to the citizens of the city, the city commission has made the decision to structure a process for further review of complaints arising out of alleged abusive language, excessive force, and harassment. If an individual feels like their complaint was not properly handled, then within 30 days of the police department's having made its decision, the complaining party must complete an Allegation of Employee Misconduct Form and mail it to:

                  Albany, Georgia 31702-0447 
                  (d)  The form is available at the city's website www.albany.ga.us; at the information desk, city police department; and at each of the four police precincts. Upon receipt of such form, the city manager will promptly forward copies to each member of the civilian review board. The civilian review board shall look into the matter and make one of the following recommendations to the chief of police:

                  (a)  It is appropriate for the civilian review board itself to look into the matter or it may appoint three of its members to an inquiry panel (panel) to conduct an appropriate inquiry. The approach taken by the civilian review board (or panel) may be to address the complainant and/or the officer at issue. Additionally, the civilian review board (or panel) may want to request the attendance of witnesses. The officer who is the subject of a complaint shall be expected to appear even if such officer is off duty at the time of such appearance. Such officer shall be paid his or her normal rate of compensation. The civilian review board recognizes the right of anyone to bring counsel with them and the civilian review board may make use of the services of the city attorney. If the matter is handled through an inquiry panel, then that panel shall upon completion of its work, make a report to the civilian review board. 
                  (b)  Minutes shall be kept of any hearings/meetings whether conducted by the civilian review board or by an inquiry panel. The civilian review board is urged to appoint a new panel each time one is used.

                  (2)  In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the historic preservation commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. 
                  (k)  Under hardship.

                  (o)  Acquisition of property.

                  (2)  In the event the historic preservation commission determines a failure to provide ordinary maintenance or repair, the commission will notify the owner of the property and set forth the steps which need to be taken to remedy the situation. The owner of such property will have 30 days in which to do this. 
                  (3)  In the event that the condition is not remedied in 30 days, the owner shall be punished as provided in section 2-42 and, at the direction of the city commission or county commission, the historic preservation commission may perform such maintenance or repair as is necessary to prevent deterioration by neglect. The owner of the property shall be liable for the cost of such maintenance and repair performed by the historic preservation commission. 
                  (c)  Affirmation of existing building and zoning codes. Nothing in this division shall be construed as to exempt property owners from complying with existing city or county building and zoning codes, nor to prevent any property owner from making any use of his or her property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances, or regulations.

                  DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

                  Sec. 2-714. - Purpose and intent. 
                  (a)  It is the purpose of this article to prohibit the mayor, each individual commissioner and other officers and employees, elected or appointed, whether paid or unpaid, from engaging in any business, employment or transactions; rendering services; or having contractual, financial or other private interests, direct or indirect, which are in conflict with, or could reasonably appear to be in conflict with the proper discharge of their official duties or the best interest of the city, or which would tend to impair independency and objectivity of judgment or action in the performance of official duties. 
                  (b)  It is the express intention of this article, in the creation and formation of the board of ethics herein provided, that the board of ethics serve for the benefit of all persons who have a bona fide question regarding a possible conflict between governmental duties and private, personal or financial interests. It is not the intention of this article to establish a secret board for the purpose of undertaking investigations, or rendering opinions on any matters not specifically presented to the board in writing as herein provided; but on the contrary, it is the express intention of this article in the creation of the board of ethics to make government better so that the public may benefit therefrom, and at the same time to protect those people who have a bona fide question of conflict; and with the same it is the expressed and avowed intention in requiring the board of ethics to hold private hearings and to publish its advisory opinions with such deletions as to names of parties and other matters involved, so that those matters of private interest and concern shall remain private and personal unless and until such time as it is made to appear that such personal and private interest is in conflict with government duty to the detriment of the public. 
                  (Code 1985, § 2-351; Ord. No. 90-131, § 1, 6-12-1990) 
                  Sec. 2-715. - Appearances on behalf of private interests. 
                  (a)  Neither the mayor, any commission member or other officer or employee, elected or appointed, whose salary is paid in whole or in part from the city treasury shall appear on behalf of private interests before any agency of the city, including any committee of city government, the Albany Housing Authority, any joint board if the city is a participant, or any other agency in which the city is involved, except in a matter of public record in a court of law as provided in section 2-716. 
                  (b)  With the exception of the planning commission, the mayor and city commissioners, however, may appear without compensation or remuneration of any kind on behalf of constituents, or in the performance of public and civic obligations. No persons serving the city without compensation shall appear, either directly or indirectly, on behalf of private interests in matters involving any committee, authority, board or other agency on which they serve or before any other committee, authority, board or agency of the city affecting matters involving any committee, authority, board or other agency on which they serve.

                  Sec. 2-716. - Representation of private interests. 
                  Neither the mayor, any city commissioner or officer or employee, elected or appointed, whose salary is paid in whole or in part from the city treasury, shall represent any person or private interest in any action or proceeding against the interest of the city, in any litigation to which the city, including any committee of city government, any joint board, if the city is a participant, or other agency in which the city is involved, is a party, or in any action or proceedings in the municipal court or the superior courts of the county.

                  Sec. 2-717. - Private interest in proposed legislation or pending decisions. 
                  The mayor, any individual commissioner, official or employee who has a private interest, direct or indirect, in any proposed legislation or any decision pending before such person or the body of which the person is a member or employee shall not vote for or against, discuss, decide or in any way participate in considering the matter, but shall publicly disclose, on the official records of the body, the nature and extent of such interest, prior to any determination of the matter. The failure of any person to comply with the requirements of this section and the failure of any person to refrain from participating in debate or voting on any matter will not affect the validity of any action taken by the board of city commissioners.

                  Sec. 2-718. - Disclosure of income statements by public officers. 
                  (a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning. For the purpose of filing disclosure of income statements, the following definitions shall apply: 
                  Business means an incorporation, partnership, proprietorship, firm, enterprise, franchise, association, organization, self-employed individual and any other entity operated for economic gain, whether professional, industrial or commercial, and entities which for purposes of taxation are treated as a nonprofit organization. 
                  Filing means delivered to the city clerk by the end of the business day on April 15 or depositing a properly addressed financial disclosure statement in the United States Mail with adequate postage affixed and postmarked by April 15. 
                  Income means any money, item of value, or in-kind services in excess of $1,000.00 received or to be received as a claim for any future services, including, but not limited to, fees, salaries or commissions. 
                  Public officer means the mayor, individual commissioners, and the members of the board of ethics established by this article. 
                  Sources of income and income sources mean income from any business. However, where a business has multiple clients, customers or patrons, nothing herein shall be construed to require the reporting of individual clients, customers or patrons. Reporting income in excess of $1,000.00 from individual clients, customers or patrons is required where the client, customer or patron has, with the knowledge of the public officer, sought and obtained the assistance of a public officer in his or her official or legislative capacity on any matter requiring official or legislative action which is of interest to the client, customer or patron. Reporting income in excess of $1,000.00 from individual clients, customers or patrons is not required where assistance in obtaining routine city services is provided by a public officer to individuals who are clients, customers or patrons of the public officer. 
                  (b)  Disclosure of source of income. All public officers of the city shall annually file with the city clerk disclosure of any source of income, whatever its nature, in excess of $1,000.00 derived from any one source for the preceding calendar year on or before the close of business on April 15 of each year such officer holds such position and for the 12-month period after such officer leaves such position. The city clerk shall promptly forward financial disclosure statements to the board of ethics, together with the list of the persons required to file under the provisions of this section. The board shall inspect such statements as soon as practical after the disclosure statement has been filed, but no later than August 15 of each year. The disclosure statement shall be on the form which shall be signed under penalty of perjury by the person required to file such statement. The form, a copy of which shall be delivered with the signature of the recipient required, or sent by certified mail with a signed returned receipt, each year by the city clerk to all public officers who are required to file the same, shall contain the following information: 
                  (1)  Date, month and year. 
                  (2)  Name of person filing. 
                  (3)  Address of person filing. 
                  (4)  Position (currently holding or held). 
                  (5)  Last date of employment, if applicable.

                  (7)  Type of business. 
                  (c)  Failure to disclose income source. Failure of an officer to file the disclosure of income source's statement by the close of business on April 15th of each year, without reasonable cause, shall render such person delinquent and result in a fine of $50.00 per day for each day past the filing deadline date. The board of ethics shall be responsible for reporting to the board of city commissioners the names of those public officials who have either filed late or incomplete statements or who have failed to file a disclosure statement as required herein without reasonable cause. 
                  (d)  Available for public inspection. All disclosure forms must be readily available for public inspection and shall be considered public documents immediately upon filing.

                  Sec. 2-719. - Receipts of gifts. 
                  (a)  Neither the mayor nor any commissioner or other officer or employee, elected or appointed, whether paid or unpaid, shall solicit or accept nor shall any person offer or give, anything of value, in any form whatsoever, calculated to influence a vote, decision or the exercise of official authority in any manner involving the city. 
                  (b)  Nothing shall prohibit any city official or employee from accepting a gift on behalf of the city, provided that the person accepting the gift shall promptly report the receipt of such gift to the board of ethics or its designee, which shall have the gift added to the inventory of property of the city. 
                  (c)  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to prohibit the offer or acceptance of a gift of food, entertainment or anything of value, given with no intent to influence the recipient in the performance of the recipient's official duties.

                  (a)  Neither the mayor nor any commissioner or other officer or employee, elected or appointed, whether paid or unpaid, shall invest, or hold any investment, directly or indirectly, in any financial, business, commercial or other private transaction, which creates a conflict with and adversely affects his or her official duties to the detriment of the city. 
                  (b)  Neither the mayor nor any commissioner or other officer or employee, elected or appointed, whether paid or unpaid, shall engage in or accept private employment or render services for private interests when such employment or service is adverse to and incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her official duties.

                  c.  Upon receipt of a complaint in proper form, the ethics board shall review it and made an initial determination as to whether the complaint is patently frivolous or unfounded or fails to state facts sufficient to invoke the disciplinary jurisdiction of the city commission. The ethics board is empowered to dismiss in writing complaints that it determines are patently frivolous or unfounded or fail to state facts sufficient to invoke the disciplinary jurisdiction of the city commission; provided, however, that a rejection of such complaint by the board of ethics shall not deprive the complaining party of any action such party might otherwise have at law or in equity against the city official. for complaints that are not dismissed, the board of ethics is empowered to conduct investigations, take evidence and information concerning any complaint, hold hearings and add the findings and results of its investigations to the file containing such complaint.

The decision of the board of ethics shall be in writing and served upon the city official and the city commission. Service upon the city official may be via the same method(s) involving the complaint. Service upon the city clerk (via hand delivery) shall be considered service upon the city commission. Service of the decision is to be made within seven calendar days after completion of the final hearing.

                  (d)  Nondisclosure of identity of informant. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, such public employer shall not after receipt of the complaint or information from a public employee disclose the identity of the public employee without the written consent of such public employee, unless the public employer determines such disclosure is necessary and unavoidable during the course of the investigation.

                  DIVISION 2. - CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS 

                  Sec. 2-761. - Introduction. 
                  (a)  This policy is only applicable to city employees, appointed city officials, agents and contractors of the city, but is not applicable to any elected officials. The code of business conduct and ethics helps ensure compliance with legal requirements and standards of business conduct for the city. All city employees are expected to read and understand this code of business conduct and ethics, uphold these standards in day to day activities, comply with all applicable policies and procedures, and ensure that all agents and contractors are aware of, understand and adhere to these standards. This policy recognizes that in determining ethical conduct, an employee or appointed official must bear in mind that he or she may have to also comply with additional standards. For example, an employee or official may be a member of a professional organization that places additional or higher constraints on individual conduct. 
                  (b)  Because the principles described in this code of business conduct and ethics are general in nature, employees should also review all applicable city policies and procedures for more specific instruction and contact the human resources department or city attorney's office if you have any questions. 
                  (c)  This code of business conduct and ethics, city policies and procedures, and/or other related communications (verbal or written) do not create or imply an employment contract or term of employment. 
                  (d)  The city is committed to continuously reviewing and updating city policies and procedures. Therefore, this code of business conduct and ethics is subject to modification. This code of business conduct and ethics supersedes all other such codes, policies, procedures, instructions, practices, rules or written or verbal representations to the extent they are inconsistent. 
                  (Ord. No. 08-134, § 1(1.1), 8-26-2008) 
                  Sec. 2-762. - Compliance is everyone's business. 
                  (a)  Ethical business conduct is critical to services the city provides to the citizens of the city. City employees are expected to closely examine this document and adhere to these practices. Many of these practices reflect legal or regulatory requirements. Violations of these laws and regulations can create significant liability for the employee, the city including department directors, other employees, and elected-officials. It is the job of employees and their ethical responsibility to help enforce this code of business conduct and ethics. Employees should be alert to and report possible violations in accordance with the whistleblower policy which sets forth: 
                  (b)  Any report may be made anonymously and must be made in one of the following ways: 
                  (1)  By contacting the supervisor; 
                  (2)  By contacting the city's human resources or city attorney; 
                  (3)  By calling the city's compliance officer or city hotline at or on-line at www.albany.ga.us; as established by the city's human resources office; 
                  (4)  By mail to: 
                  The City Compliance Officer 
                  Human Resources Department 
                  P.O. Box 447, Albany, GA, 31702-0447 
                  (c)  Employees must cooperate in any internal or external investigations of possible violations. Reprisal, threats, retribution or retaliation against any person who has in good faith reported a violation or a suspected violation of law of this code of business conduct or other city policies, or against any person who is assisting in any investigation or process with respect to such a violation, is prohibited. The city has a more detailed set of guidelines with respect to reporting violations. Employees are expected to review, understand and follow such policies and procedures. 
                  (d)  Violations of law, this code of business conduct and ethics, or other city policies or procedures may lead to disciplinary action up to and including termination. 
                  (e)  In all cases, if you are unsure about the appropriateness of an event or action, please seek assistance in interpreting the requirements of these practices by contacting the city attorney's office. 
                  (Ord. No. 08-134, § 1(1.2), 8-26-2008) 
                  Sec. 2-763. - Employee's responsibilities to the city and its citizen. 
                  (a)  General standards of conduct. The City of Albany expects all employees, agents and contractors to exercise good judgment to ensure the safety and welfare of employees, agents and contractors and to maintain a cooperative, efficient, positive, harmonious and productive work environment and business organization. These standards apply while working on city premises, at offsite locations where city business is being conducted, at city sponsored business and social events, or at any other place where employees represent the City of Albany. Employees, agents or contractors who engage in misconduct or whose performance is unsatisfactory may be subject to corrective action, up to and including termination. 
                  (b)  Applicable laws. All city employees, agents and contractors must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, rules and regulatory orders. Each employee, agent and contractor must acquire appropriate knowledge of the requirements relating to his or her duties sufficient to enable him or her to recognize potential dangers and to know when to seek advice from the city's compliance officer or city attorney's office on specific city policies and procedures. Violations of laws, regulations, rules and orders may subject the employee, agent or contractor to individual criminal or civil liability, as well as to discipline by the city. Such individual violations may also subject the city to civil and/or criminal liability. 
                  (c)  Conflicts of interest. Each employee has a responsibility to the city, citizens and each other. Although this duty does not prevent employees from engaging in personal transactions and investments, it does demand avoidance of situations where a conflict of interest might occur or appear to occur. The city is subject to scrutiny from many different individuals and organizations; therefore, employees should always strive to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. 
                  (1)  Interest and benefit to one person, not the city. A conflict of interest exists where the interests or benefits of one person or entity conflict with the interests or benefits of the city. Examples include: 
                  a.  Employment/outside employment. In consideration of employment with the city, employees are expected to devote full attention to the business interests of the city and are prohibited from engaging in any activity that interferes with job performance or responsibilities to the city, its citizens or is otherwise in conflict with or prejudicial to the city. City policies prohibit any employee from accepting simultaneous employment with a city supplier, customer, or developer, or from taking part in any activity that adversely affects the city's competitive advantage. Additionally, employees must disclose to the city any interest that may conflict with the business of the city. Questions should be directed to the employee's immediate supervisor, the human resources department or city attorney's office. 
                  b.  Business interests. Employees considering investing in a city customer, supplier, developer or competitor, must first take great care to ensure that these investments do not compromise job responsibilities to the city. Many factors should be considered in determining whether a conflict exists, including the size and nature of the investment; ability to influence the city's decisions; access to confidential information of the city or of the other company; and the nature of the relationship between the city and the other company. Again, avoiding the appearance of impropriety or conflict. 
                  c.  Related parties. As a general rule, employees should avoid conducting city business with a relative or significant other, or with a business in which a relative or significant other is associated in any noteworthy role. Relatives include spouse, sister, brother, daughter, son, mother, father, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, step relationships, and in-laws. Significant others include persons living in a spousal (including same sex) or familial fashion with an employee. 
                  (2)  Full disclosure of nature of transaction. If such a related party transaction is unavoidable, the employee must fully disclose the nature of the related party transaction to the city attorney. If determined to be material to the city by the financial director, the city attorney must review and approve in writing in advance such related party transactions. The most significant related party transactions, particularly those involving the city's directors or executive officers, must be reviewed and approved in writing in advance by the city manager and city attorney. The city must report all such material related party transactions under applicable accounting rules, federal securities laws, SEC rules and regulations, and securities market rules. Any dealings with a related party must be conducted in such a way that no preferential treatment is given to this business. 
                  (3)  Disclosure of relatives of employees. The city discourages the employment of relatives and significant others in positions or assignments within the same department and prohibits the employment of such individuals in positions that have a financial dependence or influence (e.g., an auditing or control relationship, or a supervisor/subordinate relationship). The purpose of this policy is to prevent the organizational impairment and conflicts that are a likely outcome of the employment of relatives or significant others, especially in a supervisor/subordinate relationship. If a question arises about whether a relationship is covered by this policy, the human resources department is responsible for determining whether an applicant's or transferee's acknowledged relationship is covered by this policy. The human resources department shall advise all affected applicants and transferees of this policy. Willful withholding of information regarding a prohibited relationship/reporting arrangement may be subject to corrective action, up to and including termination. If a prohibited relationship exists or develops between two employees, the employee in the senior position must bring this to the attention of such employee's supervisor. The city retains the prerogative to separate the individuals at the earliest possible time, either by reassignment or by termination, if necessary. 
                  (4)  Other situations. Because other conflicts of interest may arise, it would be impractical to attempt to list all possible situations. If a proposed transaction or situation raises, any questions or doubts should be directed to the city attorney's office. This policy prohibits real and apparent conflicts of interest that may arise among appointed officials, employees, or agents. 
                  (d)  City opportunities. Employees, officers and directors may not exploit for their own personal gain opportunities that are discovered through the use of corporate property, information or position unless the opportunity is disclosed fully in writing to the city manager, that they decline to pursue such opportunity. 
                  (1)  Requests by regulatory authorities. The city and its employees, agents and contractors must cooperate with appropriate government inquiries and investigations. In this context, however, it is important to protect the legal rights of the city with respect to its confidential information. All government and public requests for information (open records request), documents or investigative interviews must be referred to the city attorney's office. No financial information may be disclosed without the prior approval of the city manager and city attorney's office. 
                  (2)  City's spokespeople. The city manager is the official spokes person for the city and has herein delegated that authority to department directors or others officially appointed to perform in the absence of the director. 
                  (e)  Use of city's assets. 
                  (1)  Generally. Protecting the city's assets is a key fiduciary responsibility of every employee, agent and contractor. Care should be taken to ensure that assets are not misappropriated, loaned to others, sold or donated, without appropriate authorization. All city employees, agents and contractors are responsible for the proper use of city assets, and must safeguard such assets against loss, damage, misuse or theft. Employees, agents or contractors who violate any aspect of this policy or who demonstrate poor judgment in the manner in which they use any city asset may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment at the city's sole discretion. city equipment and property (buildings and land) are assets to be used for city business purposes only. Employees, agents and contractors may not use city assets for personal use, nor may they allow any other person to use city assets. Employees who have any questions regarding this policy should bring them to the attention of the city's human resources department or city attorney's office. 
                  (2)  City funds. Every city employee is personally responsible for all city funds over which he or she exercises control. City agents and contractors should not be allowed to exercise control over company funds. City funds must be used only for city business purposes. Every city employee, agent and contractor must take reasonable steps to ensure that the city receives good value for city funds spent, and must maintain accurate and timely records of each and every expenditure. Expense reports must be accurate and submitted in a timely manner. City employees, agents and contractors must not use city funds for any personal purpose. 
                  (3)  Computers and other equipment. The city strives to furnish employees with the equipment necessary to efficiently and effectively do their jobs. It is the responsibility of employees to care for that equipment and use it responsibility and only for city business purposes. If city equipment is used at home or off site, take precautions to protect it from theft or damage, just as if it were your own. Once a person is no longer an employee of the city, all city property is to be immediately returned While computers and other electronic devices are made accessible to employees to assist them to perform their jobs and to promote the city's interests, all such computers and electronic devices, whether used entirely or partially on the city's premises or with the aid of the city's equipment or resources, must remain fully accessible to the city and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, will remain the sole and exclusive property of the city. Employees, agents and contractors should not maintain any expectation of privacy with respect to information transmitted over, received by, or stored in any electronic communications device owned, leased, or operated in whole or in part by or on behalf of the city. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the city retains the right to gain access to any information received by, transmitted by, or stored in any such electronic communications device, by and through its employees, agents, contractors, or representatives, at any time, either with or without an employees or third party's knowledge, consent or approval. 
                  (4)  Software. All software used by employees to conduct city business must be appropriately licensed. Never make or use illegal or unauthorized copies of any software, whether in the office, at home, or on the road, since doing so may constitute copyright infringement and may expose employees and the city to potential civil and criminal liability. In addition, use of illegal or unauthorized copies of software may subject the employee to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. The city's information technology department ("IT department") will inspect city computers periodically to verify that only approved and licensed software has been installed. Any nonlicensed/supported software will be removed. 
                  (5)  Frequent flyer miles. Mileage earned on city related travel are assigned to the individual and will be use to reduce future city travel by the individual. When the employee retires the miles will remain the property of the individual. 
                  (6)  City credit card usage. These cards are to be used for authorized city business only and receipts are to be maintained, signed as verification of accuracy and authorized expenditure. Once signed they are to be turned-in to department finance officers/accounts clerk for retention. Should a card be use by mistake for personal business, the error will be immediately reported to the employee's reporting senior, and a formal report will be made to include a check for repayment of the unauthorized transaction. Repeated misuse of card may result in suspension, loss of card privileges and/or termination. Questions regarding this policy should be directed to the city attorney's office. 
                  (7)  Prohibition of inducements. Under no circumstances may employees, agents or contractors offer to pay, make payment, promise to pay, or issue authorization to pay any money, gift, or anything of value to customers, vendors, consultants, etc., that is perceived as intended, directly or indirectly, to improperly influence any business decision, any act or failure to act, any commitment of fraud, or opportunity for the commission of any fraud. Inexpensive gifts, infrequent business meals, celebratory events and entertainment, provided that they are not excessive or create an appearance of impropriety, do not violate this policy. Questions regarding whether a particular payment or gift violates this policy should be directed to human resources or the city attorney's office.

                  Sec. 2-764. - Responsibilities to our customers and our suppliers. 
                  (a)  Customer relationships. If the job of an employee requires the employee to be in contact with any city citizen, customers or potential customers, it is critical to remember that the employee represents the city to the people with whom you are dealing. Act in a manner that creates value for our citizens and helps to build a relationship based upon trust and goodwill. Trust and goodwill are our most important assets, and the city employees, agents and contractors must act to preserve it for its customers (citizens). 
                  (b)  Payments or gifts. Under no circumstances may employees, agents or contractors accept any offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization to pay any money, gift, or anything of value from customers, vendors, consultants, etc. Inexpensive gifts ($25.00 or less), infrequent business meals, celebratory events and entertainment, provided that they are not excessive or create an appearance of impropriety, do not violate this policy. Questions regarding whether a particular payment or gift violates this policy are to be directed to human resources or the city attorney's office. 
                  (c)  Publications of others. The city subscribes to many publications that help employees do their jobs better. These include newspapers, newsletters, reference works, online reference services, magazines, books, and other digital and printed works. Copyright law generally protects these works, and their unauthorized copying and distribution constitute copyright infringement. Employees are to first obtain the consent of the publisher of a publication before copying publications or significant parts of them. When in doubt about whether a publication can be copied, consult the city attorney's office.

                  (a)  The matters covered in this code of business conduct and ethics are of the utmost importance to the city, its citizens and are essential to the city's ability to conduct its business in accordance with its stated values. It is expected that all of employees, agents, contractors and consultants adhere to these rules in carrying out their duties for the city. 
                  (b)  The city will take appropriate action against any employee, agent, contractor or consultant whose actions are found to violate these policies or any other policies of the city. Disciplinary actions may include immediate termination of employment or business relationship at the city's sole discretion. Where the city has suffered a loss, it may pursue its remedies against the individuals or entities responsible. Where laws have been violated, the city will cooperate fully with the appropriate authorities. For detailed punitive or disciplinary actions associated with violations of this policy, review the city's personnel management system policies and procedures.

                  In accessing how to go about the above described task, the mayor and board of commissioners have given considerable weight and find the following to be relevant and useful to the mayor and board of commissioners of the city concerning the size, location and quantity of sign structures within the city must be regulated in order to achieve the above-stated intents and purposes: University of Georgia Land Use Clinic (2003, June 26).

                  In adopting these sign regulations, the mayor and board of commissioners of the city have carefully considered and especially recognize the case law coming from Georgia courts, the federal courts, and courts throughout the United States, which recognize that the regulation of the size, location and quantity of sign structures is a valid and lawful means of achieving the above-stated intents and purposes, and that such intents and purposes are valid and lawful governmental interests, which include the following: Granite State Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v. Cobb County, Ga., 193 Fed. Appx. 900 (C.A.11th 2006) (finding that the stated goals within a sign ordinance of protecting against traffic hazards and the adverse impact on the county's aesthetic qualities are substantial government interests); Gregory v. Clive, 2007 WL 2914515 (Ga. S.Ct. 2007) (recognizing as within a local government's police power to enact legislation governing billboards and signs, as such legislation clearly addresses the public health, safety, or general welfare of the community); H and H Operations, Inc. v. City of Peachtree City, Ga., 248 Ga. 500 (1981) (holding that, under its police power, a municipality can enact and enforce reasonable regulations governing the erection and maintenance of signs within its jurisdiction); Harnish v. Manatee County, Florida, 783 F.2d 1535 (C.A. 11th 1986) (finding that aesthetics is a substantial governmental goal which is entitled to and should be according weighty respect, and that the governmental entity charged with the responsibility of protecting the environment must be given discretion in determining how much protection is necessary and the best method of achieving that protection); Lamar Advertising Company v. City of Douglasville, Ga., 254 F.Supp.2d 1321 (N.D.Ga. 2003) (finding that where a sign ordinance asserts the goals of public safety, traffic safety, health, welfare and aesthetics, a municipality has shown an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free speech); Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490 (1981) (holding that the goals of traffic safety and aesthetics advanced by a municipality as justification for regulating signs is a substantial governmental interest); St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. City of St. Louis, 249 U.S. 269 (1919) (finding that billboards may be prohibited in the residential districts of a city in the interest of the safety, morality, health and decency of the community); Members of the City Council of the City of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789 (1984) (finding that a government entity can regulate signs and billboards when necessary to advance a significant and legitimate state interest, such as the protection of the aesthetics and quality of life within its jurisdiction); City of Doraville v. Turner Communications, Corp., 236 Ga. 385 (1976) (finding that under its police power authority, a municipality can regulate the location and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs within their territorial jurisdiction); Spratlin Outdoor Media, Inc. v. City of Douglasville, 2006 WL 826077 (N.D.Ga. 2006) (upholding sign ordinance where the ordinance's height and setback restrictions were rationally related to its stated goals of promoting the health, safety, morality and general welfare of the community, promoting the orderly and beneficial development of the city, promoting adequate access to natural light and air, improving the aesthetic appearance of the city, and encouraging the most appropriate use of land and buildings in accordance with the city's comprehensive plan).

Where such multi-tenant premises has a frontage of 200 lineal feet or more on either an arterial or collector street, an additional double-faced ground sign shall be permitted, not to exceed 32 square feet per sign face, and no greater than 25 feet in height. Such additional ground sign shall be no closer than 120 feet from the primary ground sign on the lot. 
                  2.  On multi-tenant lots having 25,000 or more square feet of gross leasable area, one ground sign for the first 500 lineal feet of frontage adjacent to a street and one additional ground sign for each additional 500 lineal feet of street frontage shall be permitted, provided that such ground signs on the lot shall be no closer than 250 feet.

                  (7)  Where, in the judgment of the board of commissioners, the operation of the business by the alcoholic beverage licensee constitutes a nuisance, or poses problems of law enforcement and the maintenance of public order because of the unusual number of fights and/or being frequented by known or reputed drug dealers and/or illegal sales or use of controlled substances and/or breaches of peace and/or violations of the law by patrons of the licensee occurring either on the premises or in parking lots available for use by patrons of the licensee, whether under the licensee's sole control or not.

                  Sec. 8-71. - Purpose and findings. 
                  (a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Albany, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.

                  (1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on property values, urban blight, litter and sexual assault and exploitation. 
                  (2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from certain land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses and the surrounding area, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area. 
                  (3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this article, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and nonsexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented business that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this article are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.

                  The chief of police of the city police department shall be designated the dog control officer for purposes of this Dangerous Dog Control Ordinance. It shall be the dog control officer's duty to investigate and classify as appropriate suspected, dangerous or potentially dangerous dogs. However, the dog control officer's duty of investigation and classification rises only when a report of an occurrence warranting such classification occurs in the corporate limits of the city from any law enforcement agency, rabies control office, county or state board of health, Albany Humane Society, or a written report by a citizen of the city.

                  Sec. 10-163. - Responsibilities of dog control officer. 
                  (a)  Upon receiving a report that a dog has acted in a dangerous, or potentially dangerous manner, the dog control officer shall investigate the allegations and make a determination as to the truthfulness of said allegations. After concluding the investigation, the dog control officer shall: 
                  (1)  Decide the dog should not be classified as dangerous or potentially dangerous; 
                  (2)  Classify the dog as potentially dangerous; or 
                  (3)  Classify the dog as dangerous. 
                  (b)  In the event that the dog control officer classifies the dog under investigation as "dangerous" or "potentially dangerous," the dog control officer must notify the owner by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice shall include a summary of the reason for which the animal has been classified and provide the owners with a form to request a hearing to contest the classification within 15 days of the notice date. If no hearing is requested, the dog's classification goes into effect on the 15th day. 
                  (c)  When the animal control board receives a request for a hearing it shall schedule such hearing within 30 days after receiving the request. The animal control board shall notify the owner in writing, certified mail, return receipt requested, of the date, time and place of the hearing. Such notice shall be mailed to the owner at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. At the hearing, the owner shall be given the opportunity to testify and present evidence. In addition thereto, the animal control board shall receive such other evidence and testimony as it may find reasonably necessary to make a determination either to sustain, modify or overrule the dog control officer's classification of the dog. Within ten days after the date of the hearing, the animal control board shall notify the owner in writing by certified mail of its determination. In the event that the animal control board pursuant to the foregoing hearing classifies the dog as "dangerous" or "potentially dangerous," the effective date of such classification shall be the date of the notice.

                  Sec. 10-164. - Animal owner responsibilities. 
                  (a)  The owner of any dog which has been classified as "dangerous" or "potentially dangerous" must register said dog with the dog control officer of the city on an annual basis. Failure to register a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog on an annual basis shall be grounds for confiscation of the dog by the dog control officer. In order to obtain registration or re-registration of such an animal, owners must present or provide evidence to the dog control officer of the following requirements: 
                  (1)  Proof of proper enclosure adequate to confine the dog, i.e., a well ventilated pen, fence, or structure that prevents the dog from escaping and prevents children from coming into contact with the dog. The enclosure must also protect the dog from the elements and be at least 200 square feet per dog; 
                  (2)  Proof that a uniform warning sign is present on the owner's premises. The warning sign may be obtained from the department of natural resources and shall be available through the dog control officer. Dog owner signs must conform to the department of natural resources uniform design; 
                  (3)  For dangerous dogs only, a policy of insurance in an amount equal to the minimum required under state law, issued by an insurer authorized to transact business in the state insuring the owner of the dangerous dog against liability for any personal injuries inflicted by the dangerous dog; and 
                  (4)  For dangerous dog only, a surety bond in an amount equal to the minimum required under state law, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in the state, payable to any person or persons injured by the dangerous dog. 
                  (b)  A person applying for registration or re-registration of a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog shall pay an annual registration fee. Any such dog that has been spayed/neutered may be registered or re-registered for an annual registration fee. The amounts of the annual registration and re-registration fees for dangerous or potentially dangerous dogs and dogs that have been spayed/neutered shall be established by ordinance or resolution of the board of city commissioners, from time to time, and made available for public examination in the office of the city clerk. 
                  (c)  Owners of classified dogs must notify the dog control officer within eight hours if the dog is on the loose, unconfined, has attacked a person, has died, or been sold or donated. If the dog has been sold or donated, the owner shall also provide the dog control officer and Albany Humane Society with the name, address, and telephone number of the new owner of the dog. Failure to so notify the dog control officer and Albany Humane Society shall be grounds for confiscation of said dog. 
                  (d)  An owner of a classified dog shall keep the dog in a proper enclosure unless the dog is on a secure leash, is walked or taken to or from the pen by a responsible individual. Nothing contained herein shall permit an owner to use a chain or muzzle as a permanent means of confinement. Violation of this provision, in addition to constituting a misdemeanor, shall be grounds for confiscation of the dog. 
                  (e)  An owner of a classified dog shall notify the dog control officer when moving from the jurisdiction of the city. This notice must be in writing. Failure of the owner to comply with this provision, in addition to being a misdemeanor hereunder shall be grounds for confiscation of the dog. 
                  (f)  Any owner of a dog which has been classified as a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog, or similarly classified in another jurisdiction within this state, must notify the dog control officer of the city within ten days of residency. Violation of this provision, in addition to being a misdemeanor, shall be grounds for confiscation of the dog. 
                  (g)  Any owner of a dog meeting the classification requirements hereunder moving into the city from outside the state must notify the dog control officer within 30 days of residency. Violation of this provision, in addition to being a misdemeanor, shall be grounds for confiscation of the dog. 
                  (h)  The dog control officer is authorized to make whatever inquiry is deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this division. 
                  (i)  Issuance of a certificate of registration or the renewal of a certificate of registration by the dog control officer does not warrant or guarantee that the requirements specified in this division are maintained by the owner of a dangerous dog or a potentially dangerous dog on a continuous basis following the date of the issuance of the initial certificate of registration or following the date of any annual renewal of such certificate.

                  (a)  If any of the publications listed in section 14-1 are adopted as a state minimum code pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 8-2-20 et seq., then the edition adopted by the state shall control.

These plans will be reviewed to determine if all required information has been submitted, not that the plans meet all codes. If the plans are complete the applicant will be notified and the appropriate number of plans will be submitted to inspection.

All approved plans will be submitted to the inspection department by the various departments and a permit will be issued. If there are deficiencies in the plans the reviewing department will notify the inspection department in writing as soon as possible, but not wait until the end of the review period. The inspection department will then notify the applicant in writing of the needed corrections. When all items have been corrected permits will be issued.

To make this work correctly several points are important. 
                  (1)  Plans will no longer be accepted for review at any department other than inspection. This will insure that the review is coordinated and maintained. Additionally, all fees will be paid at the inspection department. 
                  (2)  Should a department have a question regarding something in the plan, it will be possible for that department to contact the applicant/engineer to resolve the question. 
                  (3)  The inspection department will monitor all of the review process. On a weekly basis the city manager will be provided a report on the status of all project reviews.

                  Sec. 16-64. - Basis for occupation tax; definitions. 
                  Each person, firm, company or corporation engaged in any business, trade, profession or occupation in the city shall pay an occupation tax, based on gross receipts under each classification set forth in section 16-65(d), except those businesses, occupations or professions enumerated in section 16-66, which shall be taxed at a rate specified in this article. 
                  (1)  The term "gross receipts" means the gross income of a business, trade, profession or occupation from whatever source derived before deductions or expenditures for any purpose except for sales and excise taxes and items specifically exempted by this article. 
                  (2)  Any part of the gross receipts arising out of the conduct of a business, trade, profession, or occupation outside the city or the county shall be included. No occupation tax is intended to be levied upon or on account of interstate commerce; and, in any case where a person or firm is engaged in both interstate and intrastate commerce, the tax here levied is intended to be levied upon and on account of the intrastate commerce only. The tax is not levied upon gross receipts of any part of the business where such levy is prohibited by the laws of the state or of the United States. 
                  (3)  Where the occupation tax is levied on persons, firms, or businesses designated as a building contractor or building trades subcontractor, and their place of business is located in the city, the tax is based only on the gross receipts of contracts and work performed within the city or the county. 
                  (4)  Where business is solicited, the sale made, the merchandise or property delivered and the entire transaction completed in a city or county other than the City of Albany or Dougherty County and occupation tax certificate fees and occupational taxes are required to be paid to such other city or county for the privilege of doing such business and are so paid, then the amount of such sale shall be deducted from the total gross receipts. 
                  (5)  Real estate brokers transacting business within the boundaries of Dougherty County shall pay an occupation tax based upon gross receipts. Payment of occupational tax by the real estate broker covers the associates/sales agents in the office. It is prohibited for brokers to deduct commission to associates/sales agents.

                  Sec. 16-65. - Occupation tax. 
                  (a)  For the purpose of this article, every person, firm, company or corporation engaged in a trade, business, profession, or occupation requiring licenses are classified in accordance to their main line of business as defined in the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), and profitability classes are assigned in accordance with Statistics of Income, Business Income Tax Returns, U.S. Treasury department, Internal Revenue Service. In the case where a person, firm, company or corporation is engaged in more than one line of business, taxes will be levied on the basis of the dominant business activity of the license. 
                  (b)  The separate classifications of classes 1 through 6 of the NAICS, are provided for the determination of the occupation tax to be levied as measured by gross receipts in connection with profitability ratios as measured by nationwide standards. All separate businesses, engaged in more than one business activity, shall be classified on the basis of their dominant business activity, except that person whose dominant business activity is legally exempted or otherwise limited by city or county ordinances or by state law from the tax shall be classified according to its principal subsidiary business, if any, which is subject to the levy and assessment of an occupation tax. 
                  (c)  The occupation tax levied and assessed shall be determined in accordance with the following: 
                  (1)  Determine whether business, trade, profession or occupation is listed in section 16-66; if so, occupation tax is amount specified; 
                  (2)  All other businesses may determine their profitability class via the NAICS Profitability Class listing attached to the ordinance from which this section is derived. The tax rate for each profitability class will be on file in the offices of the city clerk and city finance department. Tax due shall be determined by multiplying the tax rate by the gross receipts. 
                  (Code 1985, § 26-28; Ord. No. 95-152, § 3, 11-14-1995; Ord. No. 07-125, § 2(26-28), 9-25-2007; Ord. No. 12-120, § 4, 11-27-2012) 
                  Sec. 16-66. - Specific occupation, privilege, and industrial taxes. 
                  The following trades, businesses, professions and occupations are hereby declared not subject to the gross receipts schedule of taxation as defined in section 16-64, and are hereby taxed annually in accordance with the following schedule: 
                  (1)  Professionals. Each individual practitioner of medicine, osteopathy, chiropractics, podiatry, dentistry, optometry, veterinary medicine, landscape architecture, land surveying, massage and physiotherapy, public accounting, embalming, funeral directing, civil, mechanical, hydraulic or electrical engineering or architecture who maintains their principal office in the city shall pay by calculating the occupation tax due based on a calculation of occupation tax as outlined in section 16-65(d), or by paying the sum of $400.00 per professional per year. No such levy shall be assessed upon or collected from any practitioner whose office is maintained by and who is employed in practice exclusively by the United States, the state, a municipality or county of the state, or any instrumentality thereof. 
                  (2)  Levy of occupation tax on attorneys. As of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, an occupation tax is hereby imposed on the professional classification known as attorneys engaged in the practice of law. 
                  a.  Attorneys not required to register. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary elsewhere in this article, an attorney shall not be required to register with the treasurer division. Information reported with any occupation tax payment may be retained by the treasurer division and used for those purposes allowed by applicable law. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary elsewhere in this article, an attorney shall not be required to obtain, display or maintain any city issued certificate showing that any payment or information has been submitted to the treasurer division. For the purposes of enforcement of the zoning ordinance, attorneys may be asked by the planning and development services department to submit notarized affidavits or other written information concerning the business or profession carried on at a location and the dates of operation when applying for a certificate of occupancy for new construction or renovation. Such affidavits or documents shall be used for the purposes of determining compliance with the zoning ordinance and shall not prevent the practice of the profession of law at any other location which has a valid certificate of occupancy. A refusal to submit a notarized affidavit or other written information stating whether a person engages in the practice of law at a particular location or stating the dates of operation at a location shall not be a violation of this article and shall not prevent an attorney from practicing law in the city. The chief financial officer shall document this refusal for use in any later proceeding. Where an attorney fails or refuses to provide information as to the location where they may be served with notices or citations issued in support of the enforcement of this article, the city shall direct the notices or citations to the address listed with the state bar and shall consider the failure or refusal of the attorney to provide current address information to be consent to this method of service. 
                  b.  Calculation of amount of tax. An attorney who practices law in the jurisdiction of the city shall at their option have their tax rate determined, but not the time of payment, in the manner set forth in subsection (2)(a) of this section. 
                  c.  Date when taxes are due; date when taxes become delinquent; amount of interest and penalties. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary elsewhere in this article, an attorney shall not be required to pay the occupation tax on the income generated from the practice of law in any calendar year until April 1 of the year following. The tax may be paid in person at the treasurer division or by mailing the tax to the treasurer division. Any tax payment made by mail shall include the name and address of the person or law firm paying the tax and the name of each attorney whose tax is being paid, so that the treasurer division may process the payment. An attorney who pays the occupation tax on their own behalf shall include the name of the law firm with which they practice, if any. Any tax paid pursuant to the option of subsection (1) of this section shall include a written submission containing sufficient information to enable the chief financial officer to determine the accuracy of the taxpayer's calculation. Taxes due from attorneys shall not be considered delinquent until June 1. An attorney who does not pay the tax prior to June 1 shall incur a penalty of ten percent of the tax due. Any taxes not paid by the due date shall accrue interest at the rate of 1½ percent per month. 
                  d.  Option of the chief financial officer to send bills. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary elsewhere in this article, the chief financial officer may choose to send bills to attorneys who list their address with the State Bar of Georgia as being located in the city, including those attorneys who list only post office boxes as their addresses. An attorney who prepares and signs a notarized affidavit that they did not practice law within the jurisdiction of the city during some part of the tax year for which the tax bill was generated may have their bill adjusted for the time period stated in the affidavit when such attorney did not maintain an office within the jurisdiction of the city and/or states such other reasons why the occupation tax should be adjusted. Such adjustment shall not be made for those attorneys who elect to pay the $400.00 per practitioner fee as set forth in subsection (1) of this section unless the affidavit states that the attorney did not practice law in the jurisdiction of the city at any time during the year for which the tax bill was generated. The chief financial officer is authorized to inquire whether such affidavit matches the information maintained by the State Bar of Georgia in connection with the directives of state bar rule 1-207 and/or to take such other steps as deemed necessary to determine the accuracy of the affidavit. The submission of an affidavit requesting adjustment shall not act to prevent the imposition of penalties and interest should the chief financial officer deny the request for adjustment. The option of the chief financial officer to send bills shall not relieve attorneys from the obligation to pay any tax due for any calendar year including 2006 by April 1 of the following year. The chief financial officer may include in any bills, the unpaid tax balance from other years, including all fees and penalties and the amount of interest, which has accrued on any unpaid tax liability. The failure of the chief financial officer to list any unpaid balance on any bill shall not operate to relieve the taxpayer from liability for any balance due. It shall be a violation of this section for any attorney to willfully and intentionally misrepresent a material fact in an affidavit to avoid the payment of the occupation tax imposed by this division. The sole enforcement mechanisms for enforcement of the occupation tax levy against attorneys is limited to the following: 
                  1.  When the chief financial officer has reason to believe that an attorney has willfully and intentionally misrepresented a material fact in any affidavit submitted to treasurer division for the purposes of avoiding full payment of the occupation tax, the chief financial officer shall consult with the city attorney to determine whether such conduct should be referred to the State Bar of Georgia for investigation as to whether a violation of the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct has occurred. 
                  2.  An attorney required to pay the occupation tax and who fails to do so in the manner provided by this article, shall be liable to have the tax and any penalties and interest collected by the issuance of execution pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-13-26. Further proceedings concerning the execution procedure employed in the enforcement of this section shall be as provided by state law. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary in other sections of this article, the use of tax executions and the reporting of any alleged misrepresentations as set forth in subsection (2)(d)1. of this section shall be the sole mechanism for enforcement of the occupation tax levy against attorneys. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the provisions of section 16-70 shall not apply to attorneys. 
                  e.  Payment of city funds. Payment of city funds to attorneys or law firms employing attorneys not in compliance with the requirements of this division is not authorized; occupation tax payments to be considered in employment of attorneys by the city. 
                  1.  No individual attorney, or law firm employing such attorney, who is delinquent in the payment of the occupation tax authorized by this article, shall be paid for any legal work in which they have represented the city in any capacity, until any outstanding occupation tax liability, including all penalties and interest, has been paid in full. If the chief financial officer believes that an individual attorney, or any attorneys employed by a law firm, seeking compensation for legal services performed for the city, is/are not in full compliance with this division, the chief financial officer shall notify the individual attorney, or law firm and present a bill for the amount due. After payment of any outstanding occupation tax liability, the individual attorney, or law firm may be paid for the legal work in which they have represented the city. 
                  2.  The chief financial officer and/or the city attorney are authorized to verify that any individual attorney, or the attorneys employed by any law firm, seeking to represent the city, including without limitation, limitation, acting as bond counsel, is/are current in their occupation tax payments prior to their employment. Because of the legal and/or fiduciary relationships, which such representation of the city may create, the chief financial officer and/or the city attorney are authorized to consider compliance with the occupation tax ordinance by the individual attorneys and/or the attorneys employed by the law firm, prior to any employment by the city. 
                  f.  Appeals and refund claims. Appeals of decisions of the chief financial officer and/or refund claims under this division shall be as provided under state law. 
                  (3)  State and national banking associations, federal savings and loan associations. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-6-93, an occupation tax is levied upon each state and national banking association, federal savings and loan association, state banking and loan association and other depository banking institution doing business from one or more locations within the city or the county. The rate of occupation tax on any depository financial institution subject to this article shall be 0.25 percent of gross receipts of said institution during the calendar year immediately preceding the year for which the tax shall be due; provided, however, that the minimum amount of occupation tax due from any depository financial institution shall be $1,000.00 gross receipts shall mean gross receipts as defined in O.C.G.A. § 48-6-93. Each depository financial institution subject to this tax shall file a return of its gross receipts with the city treasurer's office on or March 15 the year following the year in which such gross receipts were measured. Said return shall be in the manner and in the form prescribed by the commissioner of the state department of revenue and shall be based upon the allocation method set forth in O.C.G.A. § 48-6-93(d).

                  Sec. 22-3. - Appellate review. 
                  The orders, verdicts, judgments, and sentences of the court shall be subject to appellate review by writ of certiorari in the appropriate the county superior court or as otherwise provided by general state law. 
                  (1)  Any person who has been convicted of any criminal or quasi-criminal offense or violation of any ordinance, in any inferior judicatory by whatever name called, who desires a writ of certiorari to review and correct the judgment of conviction in the case shall be entitled to a supersedeas of the judgment, if such person or his or her attorney files with the clerk of the court the proper papers, and, a bond payable to the municipality, in amount and with security acceptable to, and to be approved by the clerk of court, or chief judge as a condition that the defendant will personally appear and abide the final judgment, order, or sentence upon such person in the case. 
                  (2)  All bonds must be paid to the city treasury department. The bond may be forfeited in the same manner as any other criminal or civil bond in any other court having jurisdiction. A bond may be forfeited according to the procedure prescribed in any of the municipal ordinances, or any provision of this chapter, or any state law granted to local municipalities. Alternatively, an action may be brought on the bond in any court having jurisdiction. Upon the giving of a bond the defendant shall be released from custody in the same manner as defendants are released upon supersedeas bonds in criminal cases where a notice of appeal has been filed. 
                  (3)  If the defendant is unable because of his or her indigence to make bond and makes this fact known by affidavit to be filed with the judge or clerk of court, as the case may be, the same shall operate as a supersedeas of the judgment; provided, however, that the defendant shall not be set at liberty unless the defendant gives a bond as prescribed in subsections (a) and/or (b) of this section. 
                  (4)  The supersedeas provided for in this section shall operate to suspend the judgment of conviction until the case is finally heard, and determined in the county superior court, to which it is taken by certiorari, or by the court of appeals upon appeal, provided that within the time prescribed by law the defendant shall apply for and procure the writ and remedies provided by law for reviewing the judgment complained of. The supersedeas shall be equally applicable whether the judge of the county superior court to whom the petition for certiorari is presented sanctions it or refuses it, provided that within the time provided by law the defendant diligently files a notice of appeal. 
                  (5)  The object of this section is to provide a method by which a defendant may obtain a supersedeas so long as the defendent is prosecuting or is entitled under the law to prosecute the proceeding brought or to be brought to review the conviction of which he or she is complaining, or any intermediate appellate judgment rendered thereon, in order that the defendant shall not be deprived of his or her right to apply to the courts by being compelled to serve his or her sentence or pay a fine before he or she has had the full opportunity allowed him or her by law of taking the necessary appeal under certiorari.

                  (b)  Motion when trial has been scheduled. Once a case is set for trial, a motion to transfer to state court will be heard only if the city solicitor is present. The court may grant or deny such motion as the ends of justice may require, consistent with the discretion given inferior court judges under state law regarding the transfer of matters for jury trial. No such motions are to be made for delay purposes.

                  No officer of the court shall be allowed to adjudicate or prosecute anyone on the behalf of the city while serving as an officer of the court, if the party before the court has been represented by that officer of the court as a client within the past six months. When such a matter occurs the officer of the court must voluntarily notify the court and recuse themselves immediately. The chief judge shall have the authority to assign an attorney who meets the minimum requirement as an officer of the court set forth in this chapter to handle that case and that case only. When the matter entails the chief judge, the case shall be set aside and rescheduled for the other municipal court judge to hear. When the offender or the offender's attorney know in advance of the situation, the following applies: 
                  (1)  Motions.

                  (2)  Duty of the presiding judge. When the presiding judge is presented with a motion to recuse, accompanied by an affidavit, the presiding judge shall temporarily cease to act upon the merits of the matter and shall immediately determine the timeliness of the motion and legal sufficiency of the affidavit, and make a determination, assuming any of the facts alleged in the affidavit to be true, whether recusal would be warranted. If it is found that the motion is timely, the affidavit sufficient and the recusal would be authorized if some or all of the facts set forth in the affidavit are true, the motion to recuse shall be heard by a Magistrate Court Judge of Dougherty County, as designated by the Chief Judge of Dougherty County State Court, or if not, a Superior Court Judge of Dougherty County Judicial Circuit. 
                  (3)  Procedure upon a motion for recusal. If the recusal motion is sustained, the presiding judge shall be recused and another judge shall be assigned to preside. In the absence of another municipal court judge, a state court judge (other than the judge who heard the motion) shall be appointed by the chief judge of state court to sit in the place of the recused judge on that case only. 
                  (4)  Voluntary recusal. If the presiding judge either on his or her own motion or that of one of the parties, voluntarily recuses himself, another judge shall be assigned to hear the matter involved. If another municipal court judge is not available to preside, or for any reason cannot preside, a state court judge (other than the judge who heard the motion) shall be appointed by the chief judge of state court to sit in the place of the recused judge. 
                  (5)  Selection of judge. Any municipal court judge involved in a recusal motion shall not communicate on the subject or on the matter to any of his or her associate judges of the municipal court of Albany, State Court Judges of Dougherty County or, Superior Court Judges of Dougherty County Judicial Circuit until such matter has been properly disposed of. In the instance of any hearing on a motion to recuse, the challenged judge shall neither select nor participate in the selection of the state court judge to hear the motion.

                  State Law reference— Unlawful, unfair, and deceptive trade practice for any person or business in any area in which a state of emergency has been declared to sell or offer for sale at retail any goods or services necessary to preserve, protect, or sustain the life, health, or safety of persons or property at a price higher than the price at which such goods were sold or offered for sale immediately prior to the state of emergency, O.C.G.A. § 10-1-393.4. 

                  Sec. 26-37. - Overcharging prohibited. 
                  (a)  In order to preserve, protect or sustain the life, health or safety of persons, or their property, within the declared disaster area, it shall be unlawful, during the duration of the state of emergency or subsequent recovery period in which the city has been designated as a disaster area, for any person, firm or corporation located or doing business in the city to overcharge for any goods, materials, services, motel rooms, temporary lodging or houses, sold or rented, within the city. 
                  (b)  Except that a retailer or installer of lumber, plywood, and other lumber products may increase the price of such products as may be necessary to replenish such retailer's existing daily stock at current market rates, maintaining the same markup percentage such retailer applied prior to the state of emergency.

The existence of overcharging shall be presumed from a substantial increase in the price at which the merchandise or cost/rental of housing was offered in the usual course of business immediately prior to the onset of the emergency, but shall not include increases in cost to the supplier directly attributable to the higher cost of material, supplies and labor costs resulting from the emergency. 
                  State of emergency means as defined pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 38-3-3(7) as a condition declared by the governor when, in the governor's judgment, the threat or actual occurrence of a disaster or emergency is of sufficient severity and magnitude as to a warrant extraordinary efforts in preventing or alleviating the damage, loss, hardship or suffering threatened or caused thereby. 
                  Subsequent recovery period means that period during which the disaster continues to cause disruptions in the disaster area, but shall not exceed six months after the emergency declaration has been terminated.

                  (e)  Investigation information. 
                  (1)  Nothing said or done in the course of conciliation under this article may be made public or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this article without the written consent of the parties concerned. 
                  (2)  Notwithstanding subsection (e)(1) of this section, the director shall make available to the aggrieved person and the respondent at any time upon request following completion of the director's investigation information derived from an investigation and any final investigative report relating to that investigation. 
                  (f)  Legal actions. 
                  (1)  If the director concludes at any time following the filing of a complaint that prompt judicial action is necessary to carry out the provisions of this article, the director may authorize a civil action for appropriate temporary or preliminary relief pending final disposition of the complaint under this section.

                  (Code 1985, § 14.5-18; Ord. No. 97-153, § 8-3-209, 12-9-1997)

                  (c)  If the director determines that no reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the director shall promptly dismiss the complaint. The director shall make public disclosure of each such dismissal.

                  (b)  Offense. The following provisions shall be the traffic regulation for automated red light enforcement: 
                  (1)  Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line or, if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if there is no crosswalk, before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown by a steady circular green signal. 
                  (2)  Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication shall stop at a clearly marked stop line or, if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if there is no crosswalk, before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown by a steady green arrow signal indication.

                  (2)  A certificate, sworn to or affirmed by a trained law enforcement officer or a technician employed by a law enforcement agency for which such device is authorized, based on inspection of recorded images produced by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein. 
                  (3)  Any recorded images detected by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system shall be available for inspection in any proceeding to adjudicate the liability for such violation pursuant to this section. 
                  (4)  Such presumption shall be rebutted if the owner, lessee, or renter of the vehicle files a notarized affidavit by regular mail with the clerk of the municipal court that such owner, lessee, or renter was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation or testifies in open court under oath that such owner, lessee, or renter was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation.

                  (6)  Such presumption shall be rebutted if the charged person can provide evidence that he or she was not the registered owner of the vehicle at the time and date that the alleged violation occurred. A bill of sale that includes, the name of the purchaser and the seller, the date of the sale, and the vehicles license tag dated prior to the alleged violation will constitute evidence that the charged person was not the registered owner of the vehicle at the time that the alleged violation occurred. 
                  (7)  Such presumption shall be rebutted if the recorded image depicts the vehicle passed through the intersection in violation of subsection (b) of this section as part of a funeral procession. 
                  (8)  Such presumption shall be rebutted if the recorded image depicts the vehicle passed through the intersection in violation of subsection (b) of this section in order to avoid impeding the efforts of an emergency vehicle to pass through the intersection. 
                  (9)  Not withstanding any other provision of this section, if the recorded image detected by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system depicts the vehicle passed through the intersection in violation of subsection (b) of this section is commercially licensed, then the owner of that vehicle shall be sent notice of the date, time and location of the alleged violation with at least two recorded images thereof. Within ten days of the receipt of said notice, the owner of the vehicle shall provide proof to the city of the name and address of the driver of the vehicle at the date, time and location of the violation and within the same time period, shall provide the driver of the vehicle with at least two recorded images of the alleged violation. After receipt by the city of the proof of the name and address of the driver of the vehicle, the driver of the vehicle shall be prima facie responsible for such violation. Failure of the owner of the vehicle found to be in violation of subsection (b) of this section to provide the name and address of the driver at the time of the violation within the period prescribed shall cause the owner to be held responsible as set forth in subsection (b) of this section. 
                  (d)  Penalty; effect of a conviction. The following provisions shall be the penalty for automated red light violations: 
                  (1)  Imposition of a penalty pursuant to this section shall be deemed a noncriminal violation and not as an operator and shall not be made a part of the operating record of the person upon whom such liability is imposed nor shall it be used for insurance purposes in the provision of motor vehicle insurance coverage. The monetary penalty imposed by this section for each violation shall be equal to the fine issued by the city municipal court for disregarding a traffic device at the time of the alleged violation and shall not include court costs. The monetary penalty imposed by this section for each violation shall double the amount of the fine issued by the city municipal court for disregarding a traffic device if the alleged violation occurs in a designated "School Zone," as defined by the state law. 
                  (2)  Failure to pay the civil penalty or file an appeal within 30 days after notification of the violation shall result in an additional penalty. Every 30-day period thereafter shall result in another additional penalty. The amount of the additional penalties shall be established by ordinance or resolution of the board of city commissioners, from time to time, and made available for public examination in the office of the city clerk. 
                  (3)  The city may establish procedures for the collection of the civil penalties and may enforce the penalties by a civil action in the nature of a debt. 
                  (e)  Summons. The following shall be the summons regulations for an automated red light violation: 
                  (1)  A summons for a violation of this section may be executed by the city by mailing by first class mail a copy thereof to the address of the owner, lessee, or renter of the vehicle as shown, in the case of vehicle owners, in the records of the state department of public safety (or any other state vehicle registration office) or, in the case of vehicle lessees or renters, in the records of the lessor or renter. 
                  (2)  No proceedings for contempt or arrest shall be instituted for failure to appear on the return date of the summons. 
                  (f)  Private entities. A private entity may enter into an agreement with the city to be compensated for providing the traffic light signal violation monitoring system or equipment, and all related support services, to include consulting, operations and administration. However, only a trained law enforcement officer or a technician employed by a law enforcement agency for which such device is authorized, may swear to or affirm the certificate required by subsection (c) of this section.

                  Sec. 36-178. - Legislative findings and purpose. 
                  (a)  The City of Albany, Georgia, having received an increasing number of complaints from the citizens of the city concerning radio and other noises emanating from vehicles on the public streets and ways and properties of the city, and having made certain observations on the subject, hereby finds and declares that: 
                  (1)  Excessive noise, when unnecessary to the carrying on of religious, political, civic, or commercial activities, or when not generated in the course of other activity necessary to carrying on the daily life, creates a significant threat to the public health, safety and welfare. 
                  (2)  Those noises which are most obnoxious to public health, safety and welfare in the city are those which are loud, boisterous, raucous, unseemly, or which are generated solely for the purpose of entertainment of a person or group of persons without regard to the health, welfare and safety of others who are unable to avoid being subjected to such noises. 
                  (3)  There has been an alarming increase in the frequency and volume of noise from the many portable sound reproducing devices available today, such as portable radios, tape recorders, and cassette players. 
                  (b)  It is, therefore, the intent of this division to strike an appropriate balance between the right of individuals to obtain information and derive pleasure by listening to radios and other devices, and the right of the public to a peaceful and healthful environment. It is not the intent of this legislation to interfere unduly with freedom of speech or religion by regulating the initial production or amplification of sound.

                  Sec. 36-195. - Procedures for the determination of sound levels. 
                  (a)  Insofar as practicable, sound will be measured while the source under investigation is operating at normal, routine conditions and, as necessary, at other conditions, including but not limited to, design, maximum and fluctuating rates. All noise measurements shall be made at or within the property line of the impacted site, unless otherwise directed in this division. When instrumentation cannot be placed at or within the property line, the measurement shall be made as close thereto as is reasonable. For the purposes of this division, noise measurements are measurements are measured on the A- or C-weighted sound scale, as applicable, of a sound level meter of standard design and quality having characteristics established by ANSI. 
                  (b)  Measurements shall be taken by police or code enforcement officers, or code enforcement inspectors, appropriately trained in the use of a sound level meter. 
                  (c)  The ambient noise levels shall be subtracted from the measured sound levels of the source under investigation by using Table 2 to determine the sound levels from the source of interest alone. If the ambient sound level is less than four dB higher than the background sound level, the source level cannot be derived and a violation of the article cannot be substantiated.

                  (d)  Fixed amplified sound reproduction devices. If the source of sound is an amplified sound reproduction device on private property (e.g., in a residential, industrial or commercial zoned area), and the complainant states that the rhythmic bass component of the music is disturbing, then the sound level measurements may be taken within the dwelling, porch, yard, hotel room, office space, etc., of the complainant. These sound level measurements shall be conducted with the sound level meter set for "C" weighting, "fast" response. Such measurements shall not be taken in areas that receive only casual use, such as hallways, closets and bathrooms. For the purposes of these measurements, the ambient sound level is that sound level which is measured in the building when the sound source under investigation is not prominent, or in a room on the same floor that is relatively unaffected by the sound source under investigation. This "C" scale measurement shall be in addition to the property line measurement described in subparagraph (a) of this section.

                  (b)  Any person seeking a special variance pursuant to this division shall file an application with the city manager or the city manager's designated representative. The application shall contain information which demonstrates that bringing the source of sound into compliance with this division would constitute an unreasonable hardship on the applicant, on the community, or on the other persons. Notice of an application for a special variance shall be given by the chief or the chief's representative to persons who frequent the area of the sound or activity and who may be adversely affected by the granting of the variance. Any individual who claims to be adversely affected by allowance of the special variance may file a statement with the city manager or the city manager's representative containing any information to support such individual's claim. 
                  (c)  In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the city manager or the city manager's designated representative shall balance the hardship to the applicant, the community, and other persons of not granting the special variance against the adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of persons affected, the adverse impact on property affected, and any other adverse impact of granting the special variance. Applicants for special variances may be required to submit any information the city manager or the city manager's representative may reasonably require. In granting or denying an application, the city manager or the city manager's representative shall place on public file a copy of the decision and the reasons for denying or granting the special variance. 
                  (d)  Special variances shall be granted by notice to the applicant containing all necessary conditions, including a time limit on the permitted activity. The special variance shall not become effective until all conditions are agreed to by the applicant. Noncompliance with any condition of the special variance shall terminate it and subject the person holding it to those provisions of this division regulating the source of sound or activity for which the special variance was granted. 
                  (e)  Application for extension of time limits specified in special variances or for modification of other substantial conditions shall be treated like applications for initial special variances. 
                  (f)  The city manager or the city manager's designated representative will approve or deny a request for special variance within 30 days of the completed application. An application will be considered complete with the city manager or his designated representative has received not only the initial application but also any additional information requested by the city manager or his designated representative.

                  (a)  Purpose and intent. The board of commissioners of the city finds and determines that graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive of the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. Graffiti promotes blight in the neighborhoods in which it occurs and encourages similar acts of vandalism. Without prompt and immediate removal of graffiti, other properties become the target of graffiti and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city and its citizens. The board of commissioners of the city, in the interest of public health, safety and welfare further finds and declares that to be truly effective in the deterrence, eradication and removal of graffiti, it is necessary to implement a comprehensive anti-graffiti ordinance. 
                  (b)  The definition of "graffiti" in O.C.G.A. § 17-15A-2, as may be hereinafter amended is adopted and specifically incorporated: Any inscriptions, words, figures, paintings, or other defacements that are written, marked, etched, scratched, sprayed, drawn, painted, or engraved on or otherwise affixed to any surface of real property or improvements thereon without prior authorization of the owner or occupant of the property by means of any aerosol paint container, broad-tipped marker, gum label, paint stick, graffiti stick, etching equipment, brush, or other device capable of scarring or leaving a visible mark on any surface. 
                  (c)  Prohibited acts. It shall be unlawful for any person(s) to deface, destroy or otherwise damage private or public property without the owner's consent by or through the application of "graffiti". 
                  (d)  Graffiti penalty.

                  Sec. 40-109. - Definitions. 
                  Words and terms used in this article are defined as follows: 
                  Permit: A permit as required by this article. 
                  Private Function: A gathering of individuals that is not advertised; is by invitation-only; and is without charge for admission to which the general public is neither invited nor allowed to attend. The guests and attendants are served in an area designated and used exclusively for the private function or event. The private function is normally booked, or set, in advance by a single contact person with the number of guests appropriate for the area. It is normally composed of a cohesive group whose members are individually invited by the host of the private function. If alcohol is involved, only those invited members may consume alcohol and they are not charged for the cost of the alcohol. The exception is when a cohesive group pools money to fund the private function, as opposed to a cover charge or entrance fee. A cover charge or entrance fee precludes a function from meeting the definition of a private party. Examples of qualifying groups as "private functions" include, but are not limited to, wedding receptions, family parties, corporate and company functions. It does not include an open invitation by a licensed establishment or business to the general public for a gathering at which the individual invitees are expected to pay for their food and beverages or for their admission to the function. 
                  Promoter or sponsor: An individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, organization or other entity that plans for, hosts, produces, conducts and/or carries out special events. 
                  Special event: Any private, for-profit or non-profit activity, ceremony, exhibition, show, concert, pageant, march, rally, block party, carnival, circus, fair, demonstration parade or assembly other than the normal day to day or seasonal operations open to the general public free of charge or for an entry fee and taking place or otherwise impacting or potentially impacting government services (e.g. police responses to noise complaints)either fully or in part on public streets, rights of way, thoroughfares, parks, squares, public property (with approval of city or county, respectively), semi-public parking facilities as defined in 6-13(a) or outdoors on private property. This includes an organized group that: moves from one location to another upon any city street, sidewalk, park or other city-owned right-of-way; has a common purpose, design, destination or goal; and consists of persons, animals or vehicles, or a combination thereof.

                  Sec. 50-4. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not exempted by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of section 50-4(b) and (c) of this chapter. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this chapter and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in section 50-4(b) and (c) of this chapter shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15)—(17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 50-4(b)(2) of this chapter; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to [O.C.G.A] § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to [O.C.G.A.] § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015, if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (18)  All waste from construction activities at the construction site shall be controlled and properly disposed of in a manner which prevents adverse impacts to water quality. Waste includes, but is not limited to: discarded building materials, chemicals, litter, sanitary waste, and concrete truck washout. A designated area for concrete washdown of tools, concrete mixer chutes, hoppers and the rear of vehicles shall be provided in a location convenient to construction activities and readily accessible by concrete trucks. The designated area shall be a zero discharge containment facility which completely prevents concrete wash water from infiltrating into the ground or discharging to any natural or structural stormwater drainage conveyance or to any waters of the state. Washout of the drum of a concrete truck at a construction site, unless in a designated washdown facility, is prohibited. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 50-4(b) and (c) of this chapter. 
                  (e)  The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 17-117, § IV, 11-14-2017) 
                  Sec. 50-5. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Albany, Georgia without first obtaining a permit from the City of Albany Engineering Director to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City of Albany Engineering Department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 50-5(c) of this chapter. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 50-4(b) and (c) of this chapter will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 50-4(c)(15)—(17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 50-5(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this chapter section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 50-4(b) of this chapter, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter. The plan for the land disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this chapter, any variances required by section 50-4(c)(15)—(17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 50-5(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this chapter, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this chapter. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7 (f) (1). 
                  (Ord. No. 17-117, § V, 11-14-2017) 
                  Sec. 50-6. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The City of Albany Engineering Department will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this chapter, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The City of Albany Engineering Department shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this chapter, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to [O.C.G.A] § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority.

                  Sec. 50-7. - Penalties and incentives. 
                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land disturbing activity. If any person commences any land disturbing activity requiring a land disturbing permit as prescribed in this chapter without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this chapter, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop work order requiring that land disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop work order; and 
                  (3)  All stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 50-4(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this chapter, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this chapter, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this chapter under county ordinances approved under this chapter shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  Sec. 50-8. - Education and certification. 
                  (a)  Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspection or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on their level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
                  (b)  For each site on which land disturbing activity occurs, each entity or person acting as either a primary, secondary, or tertiary permittee, as defined in the state general permit, shall have as a minimum one person who is in responsible charge of erosion and sedimentation control activities on behalf of said entity or person and meets the applicable education or training certification requirements developed by the commission present on site whenever land disturbing activities are conducted on that site. A project site shall herein be defined as any land-disturbance site or multiple sites within a larger common plan of development or sale permitted by an owner or operator for compliance with the state general permit. 
                  (c)  Persons or entities involved in projects not requiring a state general permit but otherwise requiring certified personnel on site may contract with certified persons to meet the requirements of this chapter. 
                  (d)  If a state general permittee who has operational control of land disturbing activities for a site has met the certification requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(1), then any person or entity involved in land disturbing activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet those educational requirements specified in O.C.G.A § 12-7-19(b)(4) and shall not be required to meet any educational requirements that exceed those specified in said paragraph.

                  Sec. 50-9. - Administrative appeal judicial review. 
                  (a)  Administrative remedies. The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by the local issuing authority upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sediment and pollution control plan; or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions; or that the holder is in violation of any ordinance; shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to a hearing before the City of Albany engineering director within 14 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of written notice of appeal. 
                  (b)  Judicial review. Any person aggrieved by a decision or order of the local issuing authority, after exhausting his administrative remedies, shall have the right to appeal denovo to the Superior Court of Dougherty County.

                  (a)  Effectivity. This chapter shall become effective immediately upon adoption. 
                  (b)  Validity. If any section, paragraph, clause, phrase, or provision of this chapter shall be adjudged invalid or held unconstitutional, such decisions shall not affect the remaining portions of this chapter. 
                  (c)  Liability. 
                  (1)  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this chapter, nor the compliance with provisions of this chapter shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the local issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property. 
                  (2)  The fact that a land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
                  (3)  No provision of this chapter shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby.

               <p>                  ARTICLE I. - STORMWATER UTILITY 

                  Sec. 54-1. - Findings of fact. 
                  In support of establishment of a stormwater utility, the mayor and board of commissioners makes the following findings of fact: 
                  (a)  The City of Albany is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs I and III thereof and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the corporate boundaries of the City of Albany (hereinafter "the city" or "Albany"). 
                  (b)  In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, Albany is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution and laws of the State of Georgia and its city charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal, a system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater services to all properties within the city and surrounding areas. 
                  (c)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff may: 
                  (1)  Cause erosion of lands; threaten businesses, residences, and other facilities with water damage; and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams, and other bodies of water within, and downstream of, the city. 
                  (2)  Adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by the City of Albany thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system. 
                  (3)  Contribute to the potential degradation of the quality of both surface water and groundwater resources. 
                  (d)  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for implementation of its comprehensive stormwater management program and drainage-related capital improvement needs. 
                  (e)  The city is required under federal and state regulations [i.e. the Federal Clean Water Act, the city's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (hereinafter "NPDES") Phase II Stormwater Permit] to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) into State of Georgia or United States' waters. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to establish a stormwater utility and impose a stormwater user fee charge upon improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4, or receive stormwater services from the city, either directly or indirectly, whether or not the property is private or public in nature. 
                  (f)  Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the city's NPDES phase II stormwater permit, the city's wastewater treatment permits, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), and the other applicable regulatory programs will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities above what is currently being spent for stormwater management program implementation, water quality management, drainage system maintenance, floodplain management, capital construction and other program activities. 
                  (g)  The cost of operating and maintaining the city's stormwater management system and the funding of necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the city's stormwater management program. 
                  (h)  The due diligence work, financial analysis and related documents prepared by the city's stormwater consultant properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and operational costs as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy. 
                  (i)  Given the stormwater management program's needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the city in concert with other water resource management programs. 
                  (j)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management system and service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the City of Albany is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
                  (k)  The stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management to improved properties in proportion to the demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management program which results in services being provided to such properties. The fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the user fee charge correlates to the stormwater management services provided to that property and the runoff demand that the property imposes on the public drainage system and the city's stormwater management program. 
                  (l)  The stormwater management needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, businesses, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways even though the benefits may be indirect or immeasurable. 
                  (m)  A stormwater management program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to implement an enhanced level of service for stormwater management service delivery within the city through stormwater user fee charges, user fees and other mechanisms. 
                  (n)  The amount of impervious surface on each improved property is the most important factor influencing stormwater runoff characteristics and these characteristics bear a rational nexus to the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city, or to be provided by the city in the future, to that property. As a result, the amount of impervious surface on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge. 
                  (o)  A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Stormwater utility user fee charges may be designed with specific modifiers to further enhance customer equity, as well as customer understanding of the user fee charge rate structure, while at the same time minimizing the city's customer account management and maintenance efforts. 
                  (p)  Stormwater utility user fee charges may be supplemented by other types of fees and charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes (SPLOST) and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city commission. 
                  (q)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site stormwater control facilities, activities or assets which reduce, or otherwise mitigate, the impact of a particular property on the city's stormwater management program, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or a credit, and such reduction or credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility. Credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the reduction and mitigation of the stormwater runoff impacts from the property. 
                  (r)  It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, systems or facilities, together with any other supplemental revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems or facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and supplemental revenues shall therefore be deposited into the City of Albany Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes in accordance with applicable sections of the aforementioned master trust indenture. 
                  (s)  In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of the City of Albany hereby exercises its authority to establish stormwater utility user fee charge rates for the provision of stormwater management services.

                  Sec. 54-2. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Act means and refers to the Clean Water Act as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.), as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant thereto. 
                  Credit means a reduction in the amount of a customer's stormwater user fee charge in recognition of a customer's efforts to mitigate the stormwater runoff impact that developed property has on the City stormwater management services and systems, and/or the efforts of a customer to offset the City's cost for implementation of stormwater management program activities such as public education, watershed stewardship, etc. 
                  Customers of the stormwater utility shall include all persons, properties, and entities serviced by and/or benefiting from the services provided by the city's stormwater management program and the stormwater utility. These services include, but are not necessarily limited to, the stormwater utility's administration, management, maintenance, expansion, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems for the handling of stormwater runoff of private and public properties, and the regulation of the public and private stormwater management systems, controls, facilities, and activities. 
                  Dwelling unit means a structure, regardless of the type or method of construction, which contains one or more bedrooms, a bathroom, and cooking facilities, designed for occupancy by a one or more person(s) regardless of relationship, living as a single-family unit. 
                  Equivalent residential unit (ERU) means the stormwater user fee charge billing unit increment related to the median horizontal impervious surface area footprint of 2,700 square feet for a single family residential (SFR) residential parcel within the city as defined herein. 
                  Hydrologic response defines the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. Hydrologic Response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface, the parcel's size, the parcel's shape, the parcel's topography, the parcel's vegetative canopy, the parcel's groundwater characteristics, the parcel's on-site operations, the parcel's stormwater controls, the parcel's antecedent moisture as well as the parcel's geologic and hydro-geologic characteristics. 
                  Impervious area shall mean and have the same definition as impervious surface. 
                  Impervious surface means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil in the manner in which it entered the soil, in natural conditions, prior to development and causes stormwater runoff to collect, concentrate or flow in a manner materially different from what would occur if the land were in an unaltered natural condition. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, buildings or structures, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of rainfall, or stormwater runoff, which existed prior to development. 
                  Improved property (or developed property) means property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than 500 square feet of impervious surfaces. 
                  Non-single family residential (NSFR) property shall mean a developed parcel of land that consists of various land uses including, but not limited to: (1) multi-family, commercial (including mixed commercial and residential), office/institutional, public, transportation, industrial, manufacturing and storage buildings and facilities; (2) parking lots, parks, public and private schools, universities and hospitals; (3) streets, roads, water and wastewater treatment plants; and (4) any other form of use not specifically defined as a detached single family residential property (DSFR). 
                  Parcel shall mean a designated parcel or tract, established by plat, subdivision, or as otherwise permitted by law, to be separately owned, used, developed, or built upon. 
                  Partial impervious surface means those areas which allow for limited infiltration of rainfall and surface water runoff into the soil in the manner that is more similar to natural conditions than "impervious surface" as defined above. Partial impervious surfaces influence and affect stormwater runoff such that the runoff is collected, concentrated and/or flows in a manner that is materially different from what would occur if the land were in an unaltered natural condition. Common partial impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, compacted gravel and/or compacted soils. 
                  Private stormwater management systems and facilities shall mean those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm drains, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff or water quality, which are not public. 
                  Public stormwater management systems and facilities (or the city's municipal separate storm sewer system) shall mean those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm drains, public streets, curbs and gutters, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey or otherwise influence either the movement of stormwater runoff or water quality, which are owned by the city, where the city has exercised dominion and control, or over which the city has accepted dedication of an easement or other legally binding permanent right of use for stormwater drainage and for which the city has the obligation of maintenance for stormwater drainage purposes. 
                  Service area means the entire land area within the corporate limits of the City of Albany. 
                  Single-family residential property (or SFR) means developed property containing one residential structure with no more than two dwelling units in or attached thereto, situated upon a single lot of record. Improved property may be classified as SFR even if supplemental accessory structures are present such as garages, carports, storage buildings, guesthouses, servants or caretaker's quarters, cottages or barns, or the presence of a commercial use within the residence, as long as such use does not result in significant additional amounts of impervious surfaces. SFR properties shall not include improved property containing structures used primarily for non-residential purposes; manufactured homes located within manufactured home parks where the land is owned by someone other than the owners of the manufactured homes; residential condominium developments with more than two units; or vacant/undeveloped property. 
                  Stormwater management services mean all water quality and water quantity related services provided by the city which relate to the: 
                  (1)  Transfer, control, conveyance or movement of stormwater runoff through the incorporated areas of the city; 
                  (2)  Maintenance, repair and replacement of existing stormwater management systems and facilities; 
                  (3)  Planning, development, design and construction of additional stormwater management systems and facilities to meet current and anticipated needs;

                  (6)  Other services as deemed appropriate by the city. 
                  Stormwater utility manager means the person appointed by the mayor and city commission to administer the provisions of this article. 
                  Stormwater user fee charge means the periodic user fee charge imposed pursuant to this article and other applicable articles related to the City of Albany Stormwater Utility, for providing stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities. This term shall exclude special charges to the owners of particular properties for services, systems or facilities related to stormwater management, including, but not limited to, charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects, on-site stormwater control systems and other stormwater management related services provided by the city for which a corresponding fee is collected for the service rendered. 
                  Undeveloped land means land in its unaltered natural condition or which is modified to such a minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural condition shall be deemed undeveloped. For purposes of this article, undeveloped land includes property altered from its natural condition by the creation or installation of 500 square feet or less of impervious surface. 
                  User is defined as any person who uses property, which maintains connection to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the city for stormwater management.

                  Sec. 54-3. - Stormwater utility and enterprise fund established. 
                  (a)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility to be known as the City of Albany Stormwater Utility, which shall be responsible for stormwater management services throughout the incorporated areas of the city, and which shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of the city's stormwater management systems and facilities and stormwater management services. 
                  (b)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility enterprise fund in the city budgeting and accounting systems for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the city stormwater management program and stormwater utility, including, but not limited to, rates, charges, and fees as may be established by the mayor and city commission from time to time, and other funds that may be transferred or allocated to the stormwater utility. 
                  (c)  All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater utility enterprise fund in trust and shall be utilized in accordance with applicable provisions of the master trust indenture dated August 1, 2013. However, other forms of revenue and/or financial resources, not accounted for in the stormwater utility revenue, may be allocated as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city commission to provide supplemental funding to the stormwater management program and for the provision of stormwater management services. 
                  (d)  The overall responsibility for the operation, maintenance and regulation of the Stormwater Utility and stormwater management program services performed, owned and operated or maintained by the city, and other related assets, including, but not limited to, properties, other than road rights-of-way, upon which such stormwater management systems and facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access and certain equipment used solely for stormwater management shall rest with the city manager. The city manager may designate the stormwater utility manager to participate in this responsibility.

                  Sec. 54-6. - Stormwater user fee charges. 
                  (a)  It shall be the policy of the city that user fee charges for stormwater management services to be provided by the stormwater utility in the designated service area shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services by individual properties and/or the level of service rendered by, or resulting from, the provision of stormwater management services by the city. 
                  (b)  The basis for calculation of the stormwater user fee charge to developed property within the city is established in this article. The city shall assign or determine the customer class, amount of impervious area and other pertinent factors as may be needed for the fair, reasonable and equitable allocation of the costs to deliver stormwater management services and to calculate the stormwater user fee charges for developed properties in the city. 
                  (c)  Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be structured so as to be uniform within the customer class, and the resultant user fee charges shall bear a reasonable connection, or rational nexus, to the cost of providing stormwater management services. User fee charge rates shall be in addition to other rates, charges, or fees employed for stormwater management within the incorporated areas of the city as defined herein. 
                  (d)  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater user fee charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by public and private property owners which mitigate, or compensate for, the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities, or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities. 
                  (e)  The stormwater user fee charges shall accrue beginning April 1, 2014. 
                  (Ord. No. 13-133, § 1, 11-26-2013) 
                  Sec. 54-7. - Stormwater utility customer classes. 
                  (a)  The stormwater utility shall establish specified customer classes within the service area to reflect differences in impervious surface and stormwater runoff characteristics; stormwater management program services provided by the city to the customers; and the respective demand that those customers' properties place on the city stormwater management program and drainage system components. Publically owned, developed properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties, unless otherwise exempted. The stormwater utility classes will encompass developed and undeveloped properties within the city and are defined as follows: 
                  (1)  Single family residential (SFR) class shall consist of all developed properties classified as SFR customers per the applicable definition. 
                  (2)  The non-single family residential (NSFR) class shall consist of all developed properties classified as NSFR customers per the applicable definition. 
                  (3)  The undeveloped class shall consist of properties classified as undeveloped per the applicable definition. 
                  (b)  Documentation pertaining to the stormwater utility customer classes shall be kept on file in the office of the stormwater utility manager for public inspection.

                  Sec. 54-8. - Stormwater utility user fee charge rates. 
                  (a)  The stormwater utility shall impose a stormwater user fee on developed properties within the service area in a fair and equitable manner. The stormwater utility shall apportion the cost of delivering stormwater services to developed properties based on the demand the property places on the city's stormwater management program, the stormwater services provided by the city to that property and the benefits derived. 
                  (b)  The stormwater user fee rate is initially set at $2.50 per ERU. Stormwater user fees shall annually increase by the Consumer Price Index over the prior 12 month period. As used herein, the term "Consumer Price Index" is the Consumer Price Index published by the United States Department of Labor - Bureau of Labor Statistics All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), 1982-1984 +100. If the Consumer Price Index ceases to incorporate a significant number of items now incorporated therein, or if a substantial change is made in the method of establishing the Consumer Price Index, then the Consumer Price Index will be replaced with a reasonable substitute. Additionally, the billing rates may be modified by the mayor and city commission from time to time to meet the financial and operational needs of the Albany Stormwater Utility. A current schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the city clerk for public inspection. 
                  (c)  In setting or modifying such rates, it shall be the goal of the mayor and city commission to establish rates that are fair, equitable and reasonable, and which, together with other funding sources available to the City of Albany Stormwater Utility for services, systems, and/or facilities related to stormwater management are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management program, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other stormwater utility related costs as deemed appropriate by the city. 
                  (d)  Stormwater user fee charges shall be based upon the total number of equivalent residential units (ERUs) associated with developed properties within the city. Each ERU shall correspond to 2,700 square feet of impervious surface. 
                  (e)  Gravel and compacted soil associated with driveways, parking areas, roads and other areas that consist of these type surface (or near surface) conditions on developed property will be designated as impervious surface and included in the customer's ERU calculation because of the hydrologic response characteristics of these materials. The total surface area associated with these materials will be calculated at 85 percent of the total ERUs to reflect the hydrologic response characteristics and limited infiltration capabilities of partial impervious surface materials. 
                  (f)  Calculation of stormwater user fee charges. The periodic stormwater user fee charges imposed on developed properties shall be calculated by multiplying the stormwater user fee billing rate times the number of ERUs for each customer account. The number of ERUs that will be utilized to calculate the user fee charge for each customer account shall be in general accordance with the following: 
                  (1)  SFR customer class: Each SFR customer account shall be charged a flat rate of 1.0 ERU except as noted below. 
                  a.  If a SFR customer account consists of more than 8,100 square feet of impervious surface (or 3.0 ERUs), the customer account for that parcel will be charged as per the NSFR calculation described herein. 
                  (2)  NSFR customer class: Each NSFR customer shall be charged 1.0 ERU for each 2,700 square feet, or increment thereof, of impervious surface located on the property to establish the total number of ERUs for billing. Fractional ERUs will be rounded to one decimal place to establish the total number of ERUs for billing. 
                  (3)  Undeveloped land customer class: Undeveloped land shall not be charged a stormwater user fee.

                  (a)  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
                  (1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
                  (2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
                  (3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
                  (4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
                  (5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable; 
                  (6)  Establish provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
                  (7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and longterm follow up. 
                  (b)  Applicability. All persons proposing development and/or construction within the city shall submit a stormwater management plan and hydrology study to the director of engineering (the director) for review of conformity with this chapter, except as provided in section 54-53. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
                  (1)  New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more; 
                  (2)  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more; 
                  (3)  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size that is defined as a hotspot land use; 
                  (4)  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this section if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules; or 
                  (5)  Activities that lie within a special drainage district as defined in the Albany Stormwater Local Design Manual (LDM) and are regulated by the provisions of the special drainage district.

                  Commemorative naming means the bestowing of an additional name to portions of streets or highways commemorating persons or events as a way to honor or memorialize the person or event in question. A commemorative street name does not change the official street name or address of any property along that stretch of street or highway. Commemorative street naming guidelines will only be effective in the unincorporated area of the county.

                  (c)  A commemorative name will only be considered for subjects with a strong association with the area, or of outstanding significance to the cultural legacy or development of the area, the state, or the nation. 
                  (d)  A proposed name will be supported by the local community and reach beyond a single or special interest group. 
                  (e)  A commemorative name will not be used to commemorate victims or mark the location of accidents or tragedies.

                  (a)  The planning and development services department shall be the agency with exclusive overall administration and coordination responsibility to administer these guidelines following initial implementation. 
                  (b)  Street addresses shall be issued by the planning and development services department for all parcels and principle dwellings and buildings located on all officially mapped public and private roads. 
                  (c)  Addresses will be provided only on those roads that have been assigned a name in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this article. 
                  (Ord. No. 09-110, § 1(4.01), 2-24-2009) 
                  Sec. 56-103. - Address numbering system. 
                  (a)  Generally. 
                  (1)  The addressing system is based on a baseline/meridian structure. The county is divided into four quadrants based on the intersection of Broad Avenue and the Flint River. (See appendix A to this article) 
                  (2)  Block ranges are well established for the city and the county and form a relatively evenly spaced grid. Where possible, one address number shall be established for each 20-foot (+/-) interval. Addresses are assigned based on the driveway entrance, not the front of the structure. 
                  (3)  Even numbers shall be on the southerly sides of roads and odd numbers shall be on the northerly sides of roads. 
                  (4)  Even numbers shall be on the easterly sides of roads and odd numbers shall be on the westerly sides of roads. 
                  (5)  Roads which are not traveling due north-south/east-west or that meander shall be numbered as a north-south/east-west road if the major portion of the road within the county runs north-south/east-west. Once a north-south/east-west road has an address number assigned to structures, then that road shall always be considered to be a north-south/east-west road. 
                  (6)  Address numbers south of the baseline shall be affixed with the prefix "south," and address numbers north of the baseline shall be affixed with the prefix "north" to avoid duplication of address numbers. The above also applies to east and west streets. 
                  (b)  Fractional, alphanumeric, and hyphenated addresses. There shall be no use of fractional addresses, alphanumeric address numbers or hyphenated address numbers. This also applies to apartment numbers and suite numbers. 
                  (c)  Component order. Components of a street address shall always be in the following order: address number, directional prefix (if any), street name and street type, designation of apartment or suite, and apartment/suite number. 
                  (d)  Diagonal streets. Diagonal streets shall be treated as either north-south or east-west streets. Once orientation is established, it shall be used throughout the entire length of the road. The orientation will not change even if the road changes direction. Within developments, it is advisable to consider the direction of the beginning of the road. If it originates off a north-south road and begins by going east-west before meandering north-south, it is generally considered an east-west road. 
                  (e)  Circular streets. A circular street/road is one that returns to the same origin point or to the same originating road. Circular streets shall be numbered beginning at the low numbered intersection and continuing to the other end of the road. The outside of the circle is numbered first and the inside is then numbered mix and matched with the outside. This will result, in most cases, with fewer numbers on the inside of the circle and with larger spaces between inside numbers. The numbering sequences of the outside and inside of the circle shall be used throughout the entire length of the road. 
                  (f)  Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs shall be addressed using the system based on the baseline/meridian structure, with odd/even numbers on the appropriate sides of the street and meeting at the midpoint or the back of the cul-de-sac. 
                  (g)  Corner lots. It is preferable for corner lots to be addressed to the road that the driveway is accessed from.

In such case the city shall not be responsible for the loss of, damage to or safekeeping of such property, but the city manager may elect to hold the property until the owner thereof shall pay all expenses and damages incurred by the city by reason of the presence of such property, encroachment or obstruction on city property in violation of this Code, and its removal. 
                  (b)  If within ten days after receipt by the owner of the property of notice in writing from the city manager notifying the owner of the seizure, and that the property will be sold as provided in this section, the owner shall not claim the property and pay the damages and expenses of the city, together with all costs of storing and keeping the property, the city manager may sell the same at public or private sale.

                  2.  When buildings are razed, the person responsible for the demolition shall locate the existing building sewer at the property line and call the city public works department to reference the tap. No charge is made for this service. When the building sewer is not located at the property line and the city public works department has to make additional trips to reference the tap, the additional cost will be billed to the person responsible for demolition. 
                  c.  Reuse of existing taps. Taps will be reused by the next occupant provided the tap is in good condition and sufficient in size, as determined by the superintendent of the sewer systems division. The tap reuse fee as established by ordinance or resolution of the board of commissioners from time to time, and made available for public examination in the offices of the public works department and the city clerk, will be assessed. 
                  d.  Locations subject to backup conditions. At locations where backups are known or are expected to occur, the director of engineering will recommend in writing the installation of a manhole containing a plug valve and a check valve for backflow prevention. Where backups are known to occur, the city will provide all equipment and labor to make the installation if the property owner will furnish all materials. 
                  At undeveloped locations where the director of engineering has reason to believe back-up conditions may occur, the director of engineering will recommend in writing that the owner make the installation of the manhole and valves at the owner's expense. Subsequent flooding damages will not be the responsibility of the city if the owner does not make the installation. If the owner later experiences backup conditions, the owner will pay the total cost, if he or she desires to have the backflow prevention installed. 
                  (2)  Construction by city forces. 
                  a.  All taps connecting to any sewer maintained, owned or controlled by the city will be installed by city forces or an authorized contractor. The work order shall constitute the permit.

                  c.  On existing sewers, where possible, a boring or drilling machine shall be used to make the connection to the existing pipe. 
                  (3)  Construction by duly authorized contractors. 
                  a.  Taps utilizing wyes will be installed by contractors where the sewer is in a street, alley or easement which is to be paved as part of a subdivision development or under contract to the city. 
                  b.  Taps utilizing wyes will be installed in all other areas during construction by contractors to serve the abutting property where sewers being installed are deeper than ten feet. 
                  c.  A record drawing showing the location of all taps will be required. 
                  (4)  Fees for taps. 
                  a.  Tap fees vary in cost according to location and conditions. Taps are classified under the following headings:

                  Existing tap reuse. 
                  The appropriate fees shall be as established by ordinance or resolution of the board of commissioners, from time to time and made available for public examination in the office of the public works department. 
                  b.  Where the cost of the sewer was either not assessed against the abutting property or was held in abeyance, the sewer tap fee shall be the actual assessment plus the appropriate tap fee as established by ordinance or resolution of the board of commissioners, from time to time, and made available for public examination in the office of the public works department. If the actual assessment is unknown, the tap fee shall be the current maximum sanitary sewer assessment rate applied to the abutting footage plus the appropriate tap fee. 
                  c.  Where the sewer is located outside the city limits, the sewer tap fee shall be equal to the actual assessment (if it could have been made) plus the appropriate tap fee as established by ordinance or resolution of the board of commissioners, from time to time, and made available for public examination in the office of the public works department. If the value of the actual assessment is unknown, then the tap fee shall be the current maximum sanitary sewer assessment rate applied to the abutting footage plus the appropriate tap fee. 
                  d.  For sewer extensions or new sewer systems being made by private developers, the developers will pay the entire costs of such extensions or developments. No "rebate" or charges for sewer taps will be made or collected by the city and rebated or refunded to the developers over any period of time, for, or under any circumstances. 
                  e.  Whenever the city has constructed in the past or does construct in the future any sanitary sewer line, the cost of which has not been assessed against the adjoining property owners, the director of public works shall determine and fix a sewer connection fee, in addition to the standard sewer tapping fee and sewer development fee, with respect to each property owner which shall be equal to the amount which would have been assessed against the property had the sewer line been constructed and assessed during the calendar year in which construction was completed, adjusted for inflation as measured by the consumer price index maintained by the United States government; provided, however, that the adjusted cost shall not be less than the actual original cost, nor more than twice the actual original cost. Any property owner tapping into the sanitary sewer line shall first pay the sewer connection fee, and other standard fees, so fixed and assessed. 
                  (d)  Construction. After all requirements for permits and fees have been met, all building sewers shall be constructed in strict accord with the city plumbing code. Building sewers outside the city limits, but which will connect to the city sewer, shall also conform to all city regulations.

                  Sec. 60-136. - Sewer extension policy. 
                  (a)  Existing development within 200 feet of city sewer, where capacity is available, is required to connect to city sewer if an existing septic tank or private sewer fails. The appropriate fees would be paid to the city for providing this service including tap fees, sewer development charge, and the cost of extending the sewer main to the property if required. The developer may be required by the director of engineering to hire a contractor to install the sewer main and tap. The work shall be inspected by the city and the developer would then pay the city a sewer development charge. 
                  (b)  New development within 200 feet of city sewer, where capacity is available, is required to connect to city sewer. The appropriate fees would be paid to the city for providing this service including tap fees, sewer development charges, and the cost of extending the sewer main to the property if required. The developer may be required by the director of engineering to hire a contractor to install the sewer main and tap. The work would be inspected by the city and the developer would then pay the city a sewer development charge. 
                  (c)  Areas not served by city sewer can obtain city sewer service in one of the following ways: 
                  (1)  Provided capacity is available and sewer service is within 1,000 feet of unserved property, property owners within the city limits may petition the city for sewer service. All property owners to be affected by the sewer extension would be notified of the petition by certified mail and would have 30 days to vote for or against the project. If 51 percent or more of the property owners to be affected are in favor of the project, the city commission by a majority vote could pass an ordinance to do the work and assess all property owners to be served by the extension. 
                  (2)  Provided capacity is available and sewer service is within 1,000 feet of unserved property located within the city limits, the city commission can pass an ordinance after a public hearing, for public health, safety, and welfare reasons, with a majority vote to extend sewer service to this area and assess all property owners to be served by the extension. 
                  (3)  Provided capacity is available and sewer service is located more than 1,000 feet from unserved property located within the city limits, but based on the existing development patterns and/or the existing land use map, the development density in the service area of the sewer extension is or could be 3.25 units per acre, the city commission may pass an ordinance, after a public hearing, for public health, safety, and welfare reasons, to extend sewer service to this area and assess all property owners to be served by the extension. 
                  (4)  A developer of property, inside the city limits, can submit plans to the director of engineering for approval to extend sewer service to a new development such as a subdivision. Sewer shall be extended to the limits of the property to allow future developments access to sewer. Upon approval of plans, the developer can hire a contractor, provided capacity is available to extend the sewer. Developer would pay for all costs with installing sewer within a new subdivision. Taps would be installed to the lots by the contractor. All development charges would be paid as building permits are issued. The city will pay for increased capacity, extra depth or increased pipe size if the director of engineering determines it necessary. 
                  (5)  Provided capacity is available, the county can request the city to provide sewer service to an unserved area located in the unincorporated part of the county. The county would pay the city for all costs of construction and all other associated costs. A sewer development charge would also be due as building permits are issued.

                  The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR ch. 1, subch. N, §§ 403—471 are hereby incorporated. 
                  (1)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director of public works may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
                  (2)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director of public works shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
                  (3)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
                  a.  Industrial user must develop a pilot testing program at the POTW. This program will include a pilot unit or a prototype treatment plant, of reasonable scale, to conduct treatment of actual influent wastewater, spiked with proportional synthetic mass quantities of expected concentration of the concerned contaminant. 
                  b.  User will present to the city a pilot testing program (PTP) plan with the following requirements: 
                  1.  A detailed description of the objectives of the PTP plan. Those objectives must be identified early in the planning process for the city's review. 
                  2.  Plan should also include: 
                  (i)  Extent of user's process problem related to permit's constituent limits. 
                  (ii)  Objectives of proposed process change or constituent level variance. 
                  (iii)  Design and operation plan of PTP plan. 
                  (iv)  Implementation schedule. 
                  (4)  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.

                  (a)  The City of Albany Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP) is designed to handle conventional organic pollutants derived from domestic discharges. The plant can also handle non-toxic organic loads to a certain degree. The city allows non-domestic users to discharge conventional pollutants such as five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5 ), total suspended solids (TSS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in levels that do not offset the WPCP operation. Non-domestic users that discharge these pollutants are required to pay an additional user fee to the city on the basis of mass quantities (i.e., for every pound of BOD 5 and TSS) discharged to the sewer system. Therefore, the non-domestic users have the option to decide if it is more economical for them to install a pre-treatment system to reduce the BOD 5 and TSS loads or to pay the city the user fees to treat the wastewater loads at the WPCP. However, if any non-domestic user discharges conventional pollutants that may cause pass through and interference, then specific limits will be set by the city on a case-by-case basis. Non-domestic users that have a valid written discharge permit from the city will have specific requirements for conventional pollutants in their permits. Non-domestic dischargers without a permit must comply with the following maximum limits of conventional pollutants: 

                   
                  (b)  In addition, this article limits the discharge of the following pollutants for all users. These limits are established to protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following (instantaneous maximum allowable discharge limits, parts per billion, μ/l): 

                   

                   
                  (c)  The following priority pollutants are prohibited, unless allowed by a written permit issued by the director of public works:

                  (3)  The monthly sewer service charge for the industrial/commercial usage with no sampling history shall consist of the base monthly charge plus a combined charge per 1,000 gallons consumed based on consumption of BOD and TSS. The amount of these charges shall be established by ordinance or resolution of the board of city commissioners, from time to time, and made available for public examination in the office of the public works department. 
                  (4)  The monthly sewer service charge for residential usage shall consist of the base monthly charge plus a combined charge per 1,000 gallons consumed based on consumption of BOD and TSS. The average consumption billed during the months of January, February, and March will be used for computing the sewer service charge for the next 12 months. For new residential billings with no consumption history, billing will be based on a consumption of 6,000 gallons per month. The amount of these charges shall be established by ordinance or resolution of the board of city commissioners, from time to time, and made available for public examination in the office of the public works department. 
                  (5)  Water used from private sources shall be metered as required in the independent water supply subsection (d) of this section and the city sewer service charge shall be the applicable charge for industrial/commercial or residential usage. 
                  (d)  Independent water supply; installation of meter. In the event a lot, parcel of land, premises or facility discharging sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly into the city's sewer system, or which ultimately enters the sewer system, is supplied either whole or in part, with water from wells, or any source other than the Albany Water, Gas, and Light Commission, then such wells or other source of supply shall be registered with the Albany Water, Gas and Light Commission and, if the water from said wells or other supply is not measured by a water meter, the owner or occupant shall, at his or her own cost, install and maintain a meter or meters on said supplies in such a location and in such a manner as is satisfactory to the Albany Water, Gas and Light Commission. These meters shall serve as a control for the establishment of the sewer service charge and shall be read monthly or bimonthly by members of the Albany Water, Gas and Light Commission. In selected cases, certain industries may read and report these readings to Albany Water, Gas and Light Commission. 
                  (e)  Additional meters. Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the director of public works that a significant portion of the water as measured by the water meter or meters does not enter the sewer system, then the director of public works may require or permit the installation of additional meters or other devices as may be deemed necessary to establish that portion that does enter the sewer system, and the corrected meter flow will be used for billing of the sewer service charge. All such additional facilities will be provided by the owner of the premises concerned or other interested parties at no expense to the city. 
                  (f)  More than one residential unit served by a single meter. When more than one residential unit is served by single meter, the sewer service charge shall consist of the base monthly charge for each unit plus a combined charge per 1,000 gallons consumed based on consumption, BOD, and TSS. The average consumption billed during the months of January, February, and March shall be used for computing the sewer service charge for the next 12 months. 
                  (g)  Establishment of categories of industries and means of setting fees. Industries discharging less than 100,000 gallons per month may be grouped in categories according to SIC classification for the purpose of sampling and billing. A representative sample will be made of selected establishments within the category and an average sewage strength determined for that category. All establishments will then be billed for the amount of their discharge at the strengths determined for that category.

                  Sec. 60-486. - Purpose. 
                  (a)  The purpose of this division is to protect the public potable water distribution system supplied by the water, gas and light commission (WGL) from the possibility of pollution or contamination by containing within its customers' internal or private water systems such pollutants or contaminants which could backflow into the public potable water system. 
                  (b)  This division also provides for the maintenance of a continuing program for backflow prevention and cross-connection control, which will systematically and effectively prevent potential contamination or pollution of the public potable water distribution system and to provide penalties for the violation or noncompliance of the provisions of this division. 
                  (c)  As drinking water quality standards are increasing in the state, a greater focus is now being given to the prevention of contamination of water distribution systems. Federal and state agencies have regulated cross-connection control and back-flow prevention for a long period of time. These regulations require the water purveyor to take measures to ensure compliance and assist in the protection of the water supply and public health. 
                  Sec. 60-487. - Definitions. 
                  The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  Air gap means the unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture or other device and the flood level rim of the vessel. An approved air-gap shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe, measured vertically, above the top of the overflow rim of the receiving vessel and in no case less than one inch. 
                  Approved means accepted by the WGL as meeting an applicable specification stated or citied in this division, or as suitable for the purposed use. 
                  Auxiliary water supply means any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor's approved public potable water supply. These waters may be contaminated or polluted or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor has no sanitary control. 
                  Backflow means the reversal of the normal flow of water caused by either backpressure or backsiphonage. 
                  Backflow assembly, backflow device, or backflow preventer means an approved device designed to prevent backflow. Approved devices shall be as follows: 
                  (1)  Double check valve assembly means an assembly of two independently operating approved check valves with tightly closing shut-off valves on each end of the check valves, plus properly located test cocks for the testing of each check valve. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance specifications as determined by a laboratory and field evaluation program resulting in an approval of a recognized and approved testing agency for backflow prevention assemblies (e.g., The University of Southern California Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research). To be approved, these devices must be readily accessible for in-line testing and maintenance. 
                  (2)  Double check valve detector check assembly shall have the same requirements as a double check valve assembly, but shall be provided with a metered bypass to detect the flow of water through the assembly. 
                  (3)  Reduced pressure principle assembly means an assembly of two independently acting approved check valves, together with a hydraulically operating mechanically independent pressure relief valve located between the check valves and at the same time below the first check valve. The unit shall include properly located test cocks and tightly closing shut-off valves at each end of the assembly. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance specifications as determined by a laboratory and field evaluation program resulting in an approval of a recognized and approved testing agency for backflow prevention assemblies (e.g., The University of Southern California Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research). The assembly shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two check valves at an acceptable level less than the pressure on the public water supply of the device. At cessation of normal flow the pressure between the two check valves shall be less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the device. In case of leakage of either of the check valves, the differential relief valve shall operate to maintain the reduced pressure in the zone between the check valves by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two pounds per square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere. To be approved, these devices must be readily accessible for in-line testing and maintenance and be installed in a location where no part of the device will be submerged. 
                  (4)  Reduced pressure principal detector check assembly shall have the same requirements as a reduced pressure principal assembly, but, shall be provided with a metered bypass to detect the flow of water through the assembly. 
                  Backpressure means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances under pressure into the distribution pipes of a potable water supply system from any source other than the intended source. 
                  Backsiphonage means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the distribution pipes of a potable water supply system from any other source other than its intended source caused by sudden reduction of pressure in the potable water supply system. 
                  Certified tester means a person who has met the requirements set forth by the state environmental protection division to test backflow prevention assemblies. 
                  Contamination means an impairment of the quality of the potable water by sewage industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds or other materials to a degree which creates an actual or potential hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of disease.

                  Industrial fluids means any fluid or solution which may be chemically, biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or concentration such as would constitute a health, system pollution or plumbing hazard if introduced into the public potable water distribution system. 
                  Pollution means the presence of any foreign substance, organic, inorganic or biological, in water which tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute a hazard or impair the usefulness or quality of the water to a degree which does not create an actual hazard to the public health but which does adversely and unreasonably affect such waters domestic use. 
                  Water meter means any device placed into service by WGL to determine the amount of water being used through the water service connection to a premises. 
                  Water, nonpotable, means water which is not safe for human consumption or is no longer under the sanitary of WGL. 
                  Water, potable, means any water which, according to recognized standards, is safe for human consumption and is under the sanitary control of WGL. 
                  Water purveyor means a supplier of water, i.e., WGL. 
                  Water service connection means the terminal end of a service connection from the public potable water distribution system, i.e., where the WGL loses jurisdiction and/or sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the customer's water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service connection, then the service connection means the downstream end of the meter. There should be no unprotected take-offs between the water meter and backflow prevention assembly located at the point of delivery to the customer's water system. Service connection shall also include water service connection from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency service connections from the public potable water distribution system. 
                  Water system means that system which is made up of two parts, the board of water, gas and light commissioners system and the customer's system, as follows:

                  WGL representative means an employee of the water, gas and light commission of the city, that the general manager has delegated the authority and responsibility of implementing an effective cross-connection control program and for the enforcement of provisions of this division. 
                  Sec. 60-488. - Responsibility. 
                  The water, gas and light commission (WGL) shall be responsible for the protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through the public potable water service connection. If the WGL requires, now or in the future, an approved backflow prevention assembly to protect its water distribution system, the WGL shall give notice, in writing, to the customer to install an approved backflow prevention assembly at each service connection to such customer's premises. The customer must take necessary arrangements to install or to have installed at his or her own expense, an approved backflow assembly immediately downstream of the water meter or water service connection. Failure, refusal or inability on the part of the customer to install, have tested and maintain such assembly shall constitute a grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such requirements have been satisfactorily met. 
                  Sec. 60-489. - Requirements. 
                  (a)  No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by federal and state laws and regulations and WGL's control of backflow and cross-connections ordinance. Service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if a backflow prevention assembly required by this division is not installed, tested and maintained, at the customer's expense, or if it is found that a backflow prevention assembly has been removed or by-passed, or if an unprotected cross-connection exists on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected satisfactorily. 
                  (b)  The customer's system shall be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of WGL to determine whether cross-connections or other sanitary hazards including violations of this ordinance exist. When such a condition becomes known, the WGL shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the conditions in compliance with federal, state and city statutes and regulations relating to plumbing and water supplies. 
                  (c)  An approved backflow prevention assembly shall be installed, at the customer's expense, on each service line to the customer's water system immediately downstream of the water meter, service connection or at the point at which the WGL loses sanitary control. 
                  (d)  It shall be the duty of the customer-user at any premise where backflow prevention devices are installed to have certified inspections and operational tests made at least once per year. In those instances where the WGL deems the hazard to be great enough, more frequent inspection intervals may be required. These inspections and tests shall be at the expense of the water user and shall be performed by a certified tester. It shall be the duty of the WGL to see that theses tests are done in a timely manner. The customer-user shall notify the WGL in advance when the tests are undertaken so that WGL representatives may witness the tests if so desired. These devices shall be repaired or replaced at the expense of the customer-user whenever such devices are found to be defective. Records of such tests, repairs or replacements shall be kept and made available to the WGL. 
                  (e)  It shall be the duty of the customer-user/property owner at any premise where backflow prevention assemblies are required to be installed above ground, to provide adequate freeze protection and protection from environmental elements, i.e., a hotbox. 
                  (f)  Only those persons that possess a valid state plumbing license or utility contractors license or the property owner, may install a backflow prevention assembly. 
                  (g)  Only those persons that possess a valid certification from a tester certification program recognized by the state environmental protection division and are approved by WGL shall test any backflow prevention assembly. 
                  (h)  Only those persons that possess a valid state plumbers license or a valid backflow preventer repair certification and are approved by WGL, may repair any backflow prevention assembly. 
                  (i)  Each backflow prevention assembly shall be tested immediately after installation, repair or relocation. 
                  (j)  Gauges used in testing of backflow prevention assemblies shall be tested annually in accordance with the University of Southern California Manual of Cross-Connection or American Water Works Association Manual 14. Testers shall be required to include test gauge serial numbers and the due date for the next calibration when submitting backflow test reports. 
                  (k)  The type of protective device required to be installed at the expense of the customer under subsection (c) of this section shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists as follows:

                  In order to obtain the objectives of this division the following standards are applied: 
                  (1)  A minimum density of trees per acre of land is required; 
                  (2)  Non-exempt property which has a land alteration activity (see definition in section 62-29) to take place is required to meet the minimum tree density requirement; 
                  (3)  A tree permit, tree permit application and monitoring procedures are established; 
                  (4)  Certain kinds of trees are determined to be desirable or preferred that will greatly enhance the foliage cover for the city. To encourage the planting of these trees a higher value (tree density unit) is given to them; 
                  (5)  Certain kinds of trees are determined to be invasive and no value (tree density unit) is given to them; 
                  (6)  The planting of trees is required in parking areas for the purpose of segmenting the pavement expanse; 
                  (7)  Alterations, including maintenance of all trees, shall be done in accordance with the tree care industry association (TCIA), formerly known as the National Arborist Association Inc., Pruning Standards for Shade Trees (ANSI A300), and in accordance with those maintenance procedures referenced in this division; 
                  (8)  Tree protection measures are to be utilized for any trees that are to remain on the site; and 
                  (9)  Any permittee is required to replace any "new" tree planted which has died within three years of planting it on the site of the tree activity. Any on-site tree dying within three years of its planting on a site is considered to be a tree removal.

                  Sec. 62-36. - Tree density required. 
                  (a)  Tree density required. 
                  (1)  Any site on which there will be a tree activity shall have not less than 15 tree density units per acre. 
                  (2)  The city desires not to create or impose undue hardship on lands which had impervious areas before the enactment of the first tree ordinance on May 12, 1992. Therefore for lands which do not meet the minimum tree density units and had impervious areas on May 12, 1992 the following applies: 
                  a.  The tree density units required are adjusted by a percentage. This percentage is the ratio of existing preserved and used impervious area which was on the site on May 12, 1992 divided by the overall area of the parcel being developed. The resulting percentage is multiplied by the TDU requirements for the site and that number is subtracted from the original TDU requirements to determine the reduced TDU requirements. 
                  b.  If requirement of subparagraph a. above causes an overall tree density unit total greater than the minimum tree density units of paragraph (1), then the required number of tree density units is reduced to require only the difference between the minimum tree density units of paragraph (1) and the existing tree density units. 
                  c.  The minimum required new tree density units shall not be less than ten percent or require less than one tree (whichever is greater) to be planted; 
                  (3)  Nothing in this division shall authorize the removal of existing trees as to reduce site tree units below 15 tree density units per site acre, and any such removal is prohibited. 
                  (b)  Sites with new paved parking areas. 
                  (1)  On sites where the tree density unit requirements have been met by trees retained on the site, any proposed or new parking areas shall be designed so as to provide for the preservation of existing trees, or living space for additional trees, to break up the expanse of the paved area(s) so that no new parking space shall be more than 75 feet from a tree density unit living space. 
                  (2)  On sites where the tree density unit requirements are not met by existing trees left on site, the site shall be designed to require planting tree density units in the expanse of the new parking area to meet the site's required tree density units; and at a ratio of not less than one tree density unit per 25 parking spaces, and so that no new parking space shall be more than 75 feet from a tree density unit living space. If there are tree density units remaining after meeting the previous requirement, then these tree density units may be placed at the applicant's discretion anywhere on the site as per section 62-37, (d) Tree density unit credit for new trees, (10) (11), and (12). 
                  (3)  Multi-level or covered parking areas are exempt from the requirements of subparagraphs (1) and (2) above. 
                  (c)  Off-site tree planting requirements/dedicated tree account. On sites to be altered having serious space limitations such as party walls, zero lot lines or other similar restrictions and having less than 7,500 square feet of paved area, the applicant may elect to: 
                  (1)  Where tree density unit requirements still remain, pay to the city $300.00 per remaining tree density unit. All checks or money orders shall be made out to the "City of Albany". The money shall be paid through the office of the city arborist into a dedicated tree account to be used only for the purchase of new and replacement trees and all materials needed to properly install the trees on public lands, rights-of-way, and on tree easements abutting public lands and rights-of-way, as designated by either the city arborist or the executive director of Keep Albany-Dougherty Beautiful. 
                  (2)  On sites to be developed with fewer than 100 parking spaces, when it is impractical to meet the criteria for replanting on the confines of the property to be developed, as determined by the arborist and/or engineering department, then applicant shall provide for replanting to occur on other properties within the city, public or private, that are acceptable to the city arborist, provided all other requirements are met. As an option to the provision for off-site replanting, the applicant may pay to the dedicated tree account $300.00 per tree density unit to plant the required number of replacement trees on public lands and rights-of-way. 
                  (Ord. No. 15-117, § 2(Exh. A), 5-26-2015) 
                  Sec. 62-37. - Tree density unit credits. 
                  (a)  TDU credits. To receive any TDU credits the minimum caliper, the minimum square footage of living space and the minimum living space radius are required. This applies to healthy, actively growing trees and requires approval by the city arborist. If a tree is in a location where a protection zone is needed or is determined to be needed, a protection zone is required to receive any TDU credits for that location. 
                  (b)  Protection zone. The physical barrier shall extend a minimum distance in all directions from the tree base at least one foot for each inch of trunk diameter. Physical barriers include but are not limited to: fencing, security screens, silt fence style of fencing, and construction warning fencing. Special conditions may warrant an adjustment to this requirement. The code enforcement officer with the city arborist's guidance shall set the special conditions and may grant adjustments to this paragraph on a case by case basis. 
                  (c)  Tree density unit credit for existing trees. Conversion from "diameter at breast height" (DBH) to "tree density unit" (TDU) is provided in the table below. To receive credit for the trees remaining on site, the minimum living space and minimum radius for living space are required. (see Appendix A). If the existing tree is a species not on the new tree list, approval must be obtained from the city arborist to receive credit. Existing trees identified as invasive species by the city arborist will not receive credit. The list of invasive species, identified by common name, includes: Catalpa Tree, Cottonwood, Royal Princess Tree, Cherry Laurel or Black/Wild Cherry, Hackberry or Sugarberry, Mimosa, Chinaberry, Tree of Heaven, and Chinese Tallow. The city arborist shall add other tree species to the list as needed.

                  Retention of large existing trees that are included in the preferred large shade trees list (Appendix A) is encouraged. An additional increase in units is provided for these trees. The increases are listed below: 
                  TABLE INSET: 

                   
                  (d)  Tree density unit credit for new trees. New trees are either approved shade trees or ornamental trees. Each listed tree has an individual tree density unit depending on the size, shape, and desirability. The minimum tree density unit is one-half and the maximum is one and one-half.

Commonly designated as a street, highway, thoroughfare, parkway, expressway, freeway, road, avenue, drive, boulevard, lane, place, circle, court, or otherwise. Various classifications of streets shall be defined as follows (see appendix 3): 
                  Arterial. A street which is used primarily for fast and heavy traffic flow at higher design speeds; is of considerable continuity and is used as a connector for travel between major activity centers with some access control. 
                  Major collector. A street which carries traffic from activity centers and minor collector streets to arterial streets and streets of higher classifications. 
                  Minor collector. Principal entrance street to subdivisions and the main streets for circulation within a subdivision which serve a network of four or more local streets. Minor collector streets are designated so that traffic circulation in a subdivision would cause such a street to be used as a link between local streets and major collector or arterial streets. 
                  Local. A street used primarily in residential subdivisions for access to abutting properties as opposed to the collection and dispersion of traffic. 
                  Dead-end street. A street connecting to only one other street. 
                  Special purpose streets. 
                  Street, private. A street or road duly approved by the Albany Dougherty planning commission pursuant to the provisions of the subdivision regulations and shown on a recorded plat.

                  Street, stub. A portion of a street for which an extension has been proposed and approved. May be permitted when development is phased over a period of time, but only if the street in its entirety has been approved in the preliminary plan. 
                  Street hierarchy. The conceptual arrangement of streets based upon function. A hierarchical approach to street design classifies streets according to function, from high-traffic arterial roads down to streets whose function is residential access. Systematizing street design into a road hierarchy promotes safety, efficient land use, and residential quality. (See appendix 3) 
                  Streets, listed thoroughfare. Those streets or portions of streets lying in unincorporated areas of the county and identified in appendix 2 of these regulations, to which access is restricted or further regulated by these regulations.

                  Sec. 25-9. - Procedures. 
                  (a)  Purpose. This section is intended to establish the procedures for planning commission review and actions on applications for subdivision development activities. 
                  (b)  Preapplication. For the purpose of expediting applications and reducing subdivision development costs, a preapplication conference shall be required in accordance with the following procedures. 
                  (1)  Preapplication conference. 
                  a.  The purpose of the preapplication conference is to allow the applicant to meet with appropriate city/county and public works officials. All subdivisions shall be submitted to the Albany Dougherty planning commission with a completed preapplication form, if requested by the Albany Dougherty Planning director. 
                  (2)  Concept plan. 
                  a.  The applicant may request an informal review of a concept plan for a proposed development. This review will be performed by the full staff with assistance from the planning staff, and is designed to provide input in the formative stages of subdivision design. 
                  b.  Applicants seeking concept plan review shall submit the items stipulated in article IV of this chapter seven days before the concept plan meeting. 
                  c.  A brief written summary of the concept plan review shall be provided to the applicant by the planning director within 14 days of the final meeting. 
                  (c)  Applications. 
                  (1)  Type of applications. The following type applications may be filed by the applicant. 
                  a.  Minor subdivision; 
                  b.  Major subdivision; 
                  c.  Phased development; 
                  d.  Administrative subdivision. 
                  Note— Certain developments may involve a combination of applications. 
                  (2)  Content. A subdivision application shall include items specified in article IV of this chapter, which constitutes a checklist of items to be submitted for subdivision review. 
                  (3)  Complete application. A subdivision application shall be deemed complete for purposes of commencing the applicable time period for action when it is certified as complete by the planning director. In all cases, however, the application shall be deemed complete unless planning staff has notified the applicant in writing of any deficiencies in the application within a 14-day period from the date of its submission. In cases where an application is deemed incomplete and the applicant has been notified in writing of application deficiencies, the application will not be processed until the deficiencies are corrected. The resubmission of an application or submission of information needed to correct application deficiencies will be considered acceptable unless planning staff has notified the applicant in writing of additional deficiencies in the application within a seven-day period from the date of its resubmission. Though an application has been deemed complete by the action or inaction of planning staff, the planning commission may subsequently require correction of any information required in the ordinance, as is reasonably necessary to make an informed decision. 
                  (d)  Minor subdivision procedures. 
                  (1)  Approval of minor subdivisions. 
                  a.  An applicant requesting approval of a proposed minor subdivision as defined in this chapter shall submit to the planning staff ten copies and one polyester film reproducible of plat information and copies of the items required in article IV of this chapter, together with a completed preapplication form, a subdivision application form and the stipulated fee. 
                  b.  Review and actions for a minor subdivision shall be handled administratively by the full staff. Actions shall be taken on this application within seven days of certification that it is a complete application or within such further time as may be consented to by the developer. Failure of any staff to act within the period prescribed shall constitute that department's approval of that minor subdivision and a certificate of approval shall be issued by the planning director on the request of the applicant. 
                  c.  The planning director shall notify the planning commission of actions taken on final plat applications within 28 days of the action. 
                  d.  Actions of the full staff may be appealed to the planning commission. An applicant requesting an appeal of the actions of full staff shall submit to the planning staff ten copies of the items required in article IV of this chapter within 14 days of the action.

                  b.  The application shall be reviewed and commented on by the full staff. Copies of the application and related information shall be furnished to the full staff by planning staff within seven days of the date of certification of a complete application. Written review comments shall be returned to planning staff within 14 days of the date of certification of a complete application. 
                  c.  Review for preliminary approval of a major subdivision on a complete application shall be handled by the planning commission staff. Action should be taken on this application within 28 days of certification that it is a complete application or within such further time as may be consented to by the developer. Failure of the planning commission to act within the period prescribed shall constitute preliminary subdivision approval and a certificate of approval shall be issued by the planning director on the request of the applicant. 
                  (2)  Effect of preliminary approval of major subdivision. Preliminary approval of a major subdivision shall confer the following rights upon the applicant for a period of three years: 
                  a.  The applicant may begin construction upon approval from the city engineer or county public works department upon approval of construction plans by appropriate departments. 
                  b.  The applicant may submit for final plat approval of either the entire subdivision, or a portion thereof provided that phased development has been permitted through the approval of a general development plan. 
                  c.  The planning staff may grant the rights referred to above in subsections a. and b. for such period of time longer than three years that is determined to be reasonable.

In addition, the applicant should submit a statement to the planning staff from the city engineer or county director of public works, and/or appropriate utility indicating that the city or county or utility is in receipt of "as built" plans showing all streets and water, sewer, and storm drainage with locations and elevations and identifying those portions already installed and attesting to this completion to applicable specifications and those to be installed, or acceptable improvement guarantees in the amount required to ensure satisfactory completion of required improvements. The applicant shall also provide evidence from the traffic engineering department that all street signs and street lighting requirements have been satisfied. Additionally, deeds to all rights-of-way, easements and improvements dedicating them to the proper government shall be submitted to the Albany Dougherty Planning Commission. 
                  b.  Review and actions for final approval of a major subdivision shall be handled administratively by the full staff. Actions shall be taken on this application within seven days of certification that it is a complete application or within such further time as may be consented to by the developer. Failure of the full staff to act within the period prescribed shall constitute major subdivision approval and approval shall be issued by the planning director. 
                  c.  The planning director shall notify the planning commission of actions taken on final plat applications within 28 days of the action. 
                  d.  Actions of the staff may be appealed to the planning commission. An applicant requesting an appeal of the actions of the full staff shall submit to the planning staff ten copies of the items required in article IV of this chapter within 14 days of the action. Such appeals will be acted on by the planning commission within 28 days of the filing of the appeal. 
                  (f)  Phased development. Where large scale developments are proposed, the developer may choose to complete the project in phases. This can be done by the submission of a General Development Plan (GDP), which encourages the developer to perform comprehensive land planning while allowing the costs of detailed site engineering to be incurred on a phase by phase basis (see Illustration 3). 
                  (1)  Application procedures. 
                  a.  An applicant requesting approval of a GDP shall submit to the planning staff 20 copies of the items required in article IV of this chapter and a polyester film reproducible together with a completed application form and the stipulated fee.

Copies of the application and related information shall be furnished to the full staff by planning staff within seven days of the date of certification of a complete application. Written review comments from the full staff shall be returned to the planning staff within 14 days of the date of certification of a complete application. 
                  c.  Review and action for approval of a GDP shall be handled by the planning commission. Action should be taken on this application within 35 days of certification that it is a complete application or within such further time as may be consented to by the developer. 
                  (2)  Effect of approval of general development plan. 
                  a.  An approved GDP is designed to serve as a guide for the applicant's preparation of and the planning commission's review of future preliminary plats. Approval of a GDP grants the following nonvested rights, which are presumed to be valid for ten years subject to engineering and environmental considerations: 
                  1.  The location and general nature of infrastructure such as streets and utilities. 
                  2.  The total number of residential dwelling units by type (i.e., detached single-family, town-houses, garden apartments, etc.) and/or the amount and type of nonresidential floor area (i.e., commercial, office, industrial, etc.) 
                  3.  The general location and density of these uses within the proposed development. 
                  4.  The nature of the proposed phases of development. 
                  b.  Each phase of the development shall be separately granted preliminary and final approval pursuant to major subdivision review procedures. Each section of a phased development must be planned and constructed in such a way that adheres to the GDP concept and meets all design standards. Also, each phase must be able to exist independently and effectively if no further phases are completed. 
                  c.  The planning commission may approve preliminary plats of phases with slight deviations from the GDP, but may require the submission of a revised GDP if the changes are determined to significantly affect the character or performance of the development. 
                  d.  The planning commission may grant the rights referred to above in subsections a. through c. for such period of time longer than ten years that it determines to be reasonable. 
                  (g)  Recordation. 
                  (1)  Plats. The clerk of the superior court shall not file or record a final plat of a subdivision, as defined within these regulations, until such plat has been approved in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and signed by the planning director. The planning staff shall be responsible for the delivering of final plats to the clerk of the superior court for recordation and shall accomplish such delivery with the next full working day after all required signatures have been affixed to the plat. 
                  (2)  Deed of conveyance. A deed transferring title of streets, easements and other designated areas shall be submitted to the appropriate commission for their acceptance. These deeds may be submitted upon preliminary approval for acceptance by the commission conditioned upon approval of the improvements by the city engineer or the county public works director as appropriate. 
                  (h)  Administrative subdivision procedures. 
                  (1)  Approval of administrative subdivisions.

                  b.  Review and actions for an administrative subdivision shall be handled by the planning director. Actions shall be taken within four days of certification that it is a complete application or within such further time as may be consented to by the developer. Failure to act shall constitute approval. 
                  c.  The planning director shall notify the planning commission of actions taken on administrative subdivisions within 28 days of the action. 
                  d.  Actions of the staff may be appealed to the planning commission.

Approval of the design of a proposed subdivision shall be considered on the basis of its relation to existing and platted streets, reasonable circulation of traffic within the subdivision and adjacent land, topographic conditions, run-off of stormwater, public convenience and safety, and appropriate relation to the proposed land uses of the areas to be served. 
                  (1)  Size and shape of land to be subdivided. 
                  a.  The size and shape of the land to be subdivided shall be sufficient and proper for land planning purposes and suitable in area and dimensions for the uses intended. 
                  b.  The plans for the subdivision of the property should incorporate into, and be compatible with, the existing and potential uses on property contiguous to the area to be subdivided. 
                  (2)  Design compatibility with natural features. 
                  a.  The design of every subdivision shall be compatible with the existing topography, drainage patterns, and other natural features on the site. 
                  b.  The design of every subdivision should conserve, wherever possible, isolated mature trees, wooded areas, watercourses, scenic views, ponds, floodplain areas, historical landmarks, and other features of the property, which, if preserved, would add to the attractiveness and value of the subdivision, neighborhood, or the city/county as a whole. 
                  (3)  Subdivision name. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate or too closely approximate phonetically or in spelling the name of any other subdivision previously approved and/or recorded, except where the subdivision is a phase or addition of a large or existing development or is a resubdivision of a previously recorded subdivision. The planning commission shall have final authority to approve the name of the subdivision and phase or addition number. 
                  (4)  Lots. 
                  a.  Political boundaries. In general, lots shall be laid out so that they do not cross any political boundary. However, if a proposed subdivision is so located as to require or is proposed to have access provided through another county or is to be located partially within either the county or the city and partially within some other jurisdiction, the subdivider shall provide the planning commission with official assurances from such other jurisdictions that such access is, in fact, on a public thoroughfare. 
                  b.  Arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with these city/county regulations and in providing driveway access to buildings on such lots from an approved public or private street. 
                  c.  Lot specifications. 
                  1.  Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards of the zoning ordinance and the health department in areas not served by public water and sewer. 
                  2.  In general, side lot lines shall be at right angles (or radial to curving street lines) unless a variation from this rule shall provide a better street or lot plan. 
                  3.  The depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for business, commercial or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking and loading facilities required for the type of use and development contemplated, as established in the zoning ordinance. 
                  4.  In general, if there are easements down side lot lines of individual lots in a subdivision and a building site consists of more than one lot, the easement down the middle of interior lot line is voided or removed unless there has been some utility construction placed within the easement and the utility easement is relocated down the new property line. An administrative subdivision shall be filed removing the center lot line. 
                  5.  Lots abutting a watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream shall have a minimum width and depth required to provide an adequate building site while providing front, side, and rear yards as required in the zoning ordinance. As required in the city/county floodplain management ordinance, the building finished floor elevation shall be one foot above the flood level as measured from the 100-year floodwater line. 
                  d.  Access. 
                  1.  All lots shall abut a public or approved private street as permitted by the provisions of these regulations. 
                  2.  Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from major or minor arterial streets or highways or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
                  3.  All subdivisions containing lots fronting on state highways shall be submitted to the department of transportation for approval. 
                  4.  Single business enterprises and multiple business developments considered to be high-traffic generators shall provide a cross access drive and pedestrian access to allow circulation between sites. 
                  e.  Driveway location. 
                  1.  Driveways shall be located so that there is adequate clear sight distance onto the abutting road, avoiding locations along the inside curve or below the crown of a hilltop on an arterial street. 
                  f.  Flag lots. Flag lots shall be allowed as follows: 
                  1.  Where the flag lot makes it possible to better utilize irregularly shaped properties or areas with resource limitations. 
                  2.  The "pole" portion of a flag lot shall be included as part of the lot area for the purpose of determining average lot area, and the "pole" shall have a minimum width at the street right-of-way of not less than 30 feet, provided that, where flag lots are used, there shall be at least two lots at any point of access for a total minimum joint frontage of 60 feet. 
                  3.  Flag lots shall not be permitted whenever their effect would be to increase the number of driveways taking access to a collector or arterial road. Shared driveways shall be used to eliminate additional points of access. This criterion prohibits one of the most common abuses, the use of flag lots to avoid the developmental costs of roads. These sites are best developed without flag lots, even if the cost of the lots is thereby increased, since controlling access reduces congestion on major roads. The shared driveway cut shall be provided by the developer and the driveway shall be constructed to the minimum depth necessary to serve all lots prior to recording the plat. 
                  4.  Minimum lot area for flag lots shall be at least twice that of the zoning district in which the flag lot is located, except in the AG district where the minimum lot size shall remain ten acres. 
                  5.  Side and rear yard requirements shall be met on the lot excluding the "pole" portion of the lot. 
                  6.  The maximum length of the "pole" portion of the lot shall be no more than five times the lot width measured at the building line. This may be greater due to unusual circumstances when approved by the planning commission. 
                  7.  A minimum frontage of 30 feet shall apply to lots which front upon the turn-around portion of a cul-de-sac. 
                  (5)  Blocks. 
                  a.  Design. 
                  1.  The length, width, and shape of blocks shall be determined with due regard for the following: 
                  i.  Provisions for adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of uses contemplated. 
                  ii.  The size requirements of lot size within the applicable zoning district. 
                  iii.  Need for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of the street traffic. 
                  2.  Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be permitted in blocks adjacent to arterial streets, railroads, water-courses, drainageways, or other property lines of the subdivision. 
                  3.  No block should exceed 1,800 feet in length except where required by unusual topographic conditions. 
                  4.  In blocks exceeding 1,200 feet in length, the planning commission may require a 20 foot-wide right-of-way or easement through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, and/or a paved sidewalk. 
                  (Code 1985, § 25-22; Ord. No. 93-142, § 1(art. IV, B), 6-22-1993; Ord. No. 94-133, § 1, 6-29-1994; Ord. No. 94-158, § 1, 10-11-1994; Ord. No. 97-131, § 1, 7-8-1997; Ord. No. 99-137, 12-14-1999) 
                  Sec. 25-23. - Streets. 
                  (a)  General standards. 
                  (1)  All streets. All streets in the subdivision shall be properly integrated with the existing and proposed street system as established on the DARTS plan and comprehensive plan of the city and the county. 
                  (2)  Major elements. Major elements of the street system should be used to help define and buffer different land use areas, enhancing their identity and cohesiveness. 
                  (3)  Minimize length, intersections and paved area. To the extent feasible, the lineal length of streets, the number of street intersections, and the paved area within intersections should be minimized. 
                  (4)  The design of the street system. The design of the street system of the subdivisions shall be in accordance with table I-A and I-B—minimum standards for street design and construction—and shall be in accordance with the engineering standards herein. 
                  (5)  Adequate drainage structures. Adequate drainage structures shall be provided. The design, installation, and construction of drainage structures shall comply with the engineering standards herein and the city and the county floodplain management ordinance. 
                  (6)  Private streets. Private streets shall be permitted if they have an alignment and width consistent with engineering and planning commission recommendations, have adequate easements for utilities and access and are local in nature and designed to prevent through traffic. Prior to final plan approval, the applicant shall file a release of maintenance agreement with the city/county attorney, releasing the relevant governing body from any present or future maintenance of all private streets. The perpetual maintenance of private streets shall be guaranteed by the establishment of a homeowners' association, other responsible association, or other instrument. In all cases, the instrument of street maintenance shall be approved by the planning commission. When built, private streets shall have signs posted indicating they are private streets. If, in the future, the property owners desire the streets to become public, they shall be improved to existing city/county standards prior to acceptance by the governing body. Private street design and construction standards shall be submitted to the city/county engineer for approval. In no case shall land reserved for right-of-way be less than required for a similar public street, nor shall the road width be less than required for a public road of similar classification. 
                  (7)  Private access drives. Private access drives shall be permitted to serve landlocked lots only where landlocked lots were in existence prior to the enactment of these regulations or are a result of special physical features that otherwise render the property undevelopable. No more than one such drive shall be approved per subdivision development and must be approved as part of the original plat. 
                  (8)  Listed thoroughfares. Listed thoroughfares to which driveway access is restricted or limited by these regulations are included in appendix 2 and regulated as follows: 
                  a.  Where a subdivision for single-family and two-family lots will abut or contains any of the thoroughfares listed in appendix 2, the planning commission shall require that such single-family and two-family lots not have direct vehicular access to such listed thoroughfares except in the cases of: 
                  1.  Subdivisions of property to accommodate the residential needs of family members of the owner of a large tract of land; in which case, minimum frontages are to be as close to that required by exception 3. below as practical; however, when such frontage cannot be met, the planning commission may, upon the recommendation of the county director of public works or such person as may be directed to act as the county traffic engineer, approve lesser frontages and driveway spacing as low as that permitted in exception 4. below; 
                  2.  When there are particular and unusual physical conditions not caused by the owner which would result in a hardship as distinguished from a mere inconvenience; 
                  3.  Where any lot created will have a minimum frontage of 200 feet and only one driveway per lot; or 
                  4.  Where the subdivision will have minimum lot frontages of 200 feet for all corner lots and 150 feet for all noncorner (interior) lots and the plat will contain restrictive covenants requiring the use of joint (common) or abutting driveways or parallel driveways which are no more than six feet from the property line. 
                  Generally, this would mean that lots should not front said listed thoroughfares; however, any design solution which satisfies the intent of restricting direct vehicular access to such thoroughfares would be acceptable. Potential design solutions to achieve this purpose include: 
                  i.  Use of marginal access streets wherein land abutting a listed thoroughfare is separated from such thoroughfare by a planted or grassed strip of land and a marginal access street; 
                  ii.  Use of reverse frontage lots wherein lots back up to a listed thoroughfare and front on and have access only to a local or minor collector street running approximately parallel to the listed thoroughfare. Such reverse frontage lots shall have a no-access reservation (at least 15 feet wide) along their rear property line and immediately adjacent to any abutting listed thoroughfare; 
                  iii.  Using one or more cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets or short looping streets wherein lots front and only have access to such streets and those streets are only entered from and generally designed at right angles to a street not a listed thoroughfare and laid out approximately parallel to any listed thoroughfare; and 
                  iv.  Other such design solutions as may be devised to achieve the same results. The use of deep lots with rear service alleys and a no access reservation along the front of the lot or the use of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets or short looping streets having direct access to a listed thoroughfare is not considered a good solution and should be approved only when unique circumstances make other solutions unacceptable. 
                  Where a commercial or industrial subdivision will abut or contain a listed thoroughfare, the planning commission may require the use of such design standards as listed above. 
                  b.  Any lot on a designated listed thoroughfare but not a state highway which is to be used for residential purposes containing three or more dwelling units per building shall be reviewed and approved as a business use property. 
                  c.  Single business enterprise on a single lot on a "listed thoroughfare." 
                  1.  Traffic movements confined primarily to on-site employees of any type business of no more than 40 employees are permitted driveways as follows: 
                  i.  Corner lots. One two-way on the principle thoroughfare and one two-way on the cross street; or 
                  ii.  Interior lots. One two-way driveway or two one-way driveways. 
                  2.  Traffic movements consisting primarily of in-and-out customer activities with any type business except service stations and convenience stores with gas and characteristics shall be permitted driveways as indicated below: 
                  i.  No more than 50 on-site parking spaces or are located on sites of less than 300 feet [of] frontage are permitted driveways as follows: 
                  aa.  Corner lots. One two-way driveway on the principle thoroughfare or side cross street and one two-way or two one-way driveways on the other remaining street; or 
                  bb.  Interior lots. One two-way driveway or two one-way driveways. 
                  ii.  More than 50 on-site parking spaces and are on sites having a minimum of 300 feet [of] frontage are permitted driveways as follows: 
                  aa.  Corner lot. Two two-way driveways on the principle thoroughfare or side cross street and one two-way or two one-way driveways on the other remaining street; or 
                  bb.  Interior lot. Two two-way driveways. 
                  cc.  Service stations and convenience stores which include gas and oil sales and have a minimum frontage of 150 feet shall be permitted no more than one curb opening for each 50 feet of frontage or major fraction thereof along any street. 
                  No driveway or curb opening shall be located nearer than ten feet to any corner or exterior lot line, as measured along the property line. No driveway shall be located nearer than 30 feet, as measured along the property line, to any other driveway giving access to or from the same service station. 
                  cc [dd.]  In all cases, driveways are to be located as far as practical from an inter-section. 
                  d.  Multiple businesses on either corner or interior lots or tracts on a "listed thoroughfare." The following applies to as many said thoroughfares as the property borders and any business use. 
                  1.  Sites with up to 300 feet of frontage are permitted one two-way driveway or two one-way driveways. 
                  2.  Sites with more than 300 feet and up to 1,000 feet of frontage are permitted two two-way driveways. 
                  3.  Sites with more than 1,000 feet and up to 2,000 feet of frontage are permitted three two-way driveways. 
                  4.  Sites with more than 2,000 feet and up to 3,000 feet of frontage are permitted three two-way driveways or two one-way driveways and one multilaned driveway. 
                  5.  Sites with more than 3,000 feet of frontage will be permitted driveways on a case-by-case basis upon study and recommendation of the person designated to act as the county traffic engineer and/or state traffic and safety engineer as appropriate. 
                  In the above instances (1.—5.), driveways of corner lots or tracts shall be as far as practical from the intersection. 
                  h. [6.]  (Driveway access for listed streets in the city, not under the jurisdiction of the state Department of Transportation (GDOT), is regulated by h(5)[e.]—(9)[i.]. Listed streets within the Central Business District are exempt from these regulations.) 
                  (e) [e.]  Where a subdivision for single-family and two-family lots will abut or contains any of the urban principal or minor arterials listed in Appendix 3, the planning commission shall require that such single-family and two-family lots not have direct vehicular access to such listed urban principal or minor arterials. Access must be from an interior local street or frontage street. 
                  The planning commission may, upon the recommendation of the city Engineer, allow direct access to listed principal or minor arterials under the following conditions: 
                  (a)  Subdivision of property to accommodate the residential needs of family members of the owner of a large tract of land; 
                  (b)  When there are particular and unusual physical conditions, not caused by the owner, which would result in a hardship as distinguished from a mere inconvenience. 
                  The following minimum frontages for listed urban principal or minor arterials are allowed if the planning commission grants direct access based on (a) or (b) above; any lot created will have a minimum frontage of 450 feet and only one driveway per lot; or where the subdivision will have minimum lot frontages of 300 feet for all corner lots and 250 feet for all non-corner (interior) lots and the plat will contain restrictive covenants requiring the use of joint (common) or abutting driveways, or parallel driveways which are no more than six feet from the property line. 
                  (f) [f.]  Subdivision of property on a listed urban principal or minor arterial, which is to be used for residential purposes containing three or more dwelling units per building shall follow access requirements outlined in (7) for commercial and industrial subdivisions. 
                  (g) [g.]  Where a commercial or industrial subdivision will abut or contain an urban principal or minor arterial listed in Appendix 3, the planning commission shall require that such lots follow driveway access guidelines established by the GDOT document "Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control." These guidelines are attached as appendix A. 
                  (h) [h.]  Where any lot abuts or contains a collector listed in appendix 3, the planning commission shall require that such lots follow driveway access guidelines established by the GDOT document "Regulations for Driveway and Encroachment Control." These guidelines are attached as appendix 4. 
                  (i) [i.]  An appeal for additional access for (7) and (8) above must be made to the city engineering department according to that department's procedure. 
                  (9)  Improvement plan and grading requirements. Streets shall be graded and improved to conform to the city and county construction standards and engineering specifications and shall be approved as to design and constructions by the city engineer and the county director of public works. 
                  (10)  Alleys. Alleys may be required in high density residential, commercial and industrial developments. Where provided, alleys shall have a minimum right-of-way (ROW) width of 25 feet and a minimum pavement width of 20 feet. (See table I-A, I-B—minimum standards for street designs.) 
                  (11)  Dead-end streets (temporary). If the adjacent property is undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-of-way shall be extended to the boundary line of the property being subdivided. A temporary turnaround of a design approved by the city engineer and the the county director of public works shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the notation on the subdivision plat that land required outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to abutting owners whenever the street is continued. 
                  (12)  Cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs in residential areas should not be longer than 1,800 feet, but may be approved for longer lengths depending on design constraints. Cul-de-sacs may be built with standard circular turnarounds or with standard circular turnarounds with center islands. If a cul-de-sac is built with standard circular turnaround with center island, the island shall be landscaped with grass or trees and maintained by a homeowners association. All dead-end streets shall be provided with a cul-de-sac. 
                  (13)  Sight triangles (clear sight distance). Where any street intersection is created which would create a traffic hazard by limiting visibility within the sight triangle, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to the extent deemed necessary to comply with the sight distance requirements of these regulations and shall not erect any sign or improvement which would preclude safe sight distance. 
                  (14)  Curb and gutter. 
                  a.  Where curb and gutter are constructed, vertical curb shall be used on all collector streets. Mountable (rolled) curb may be used on local streets if its use does not adversely affect storm drainage, if approved by the city engineer. (Design specifications for curb are contained in the appropriate jurisdiction's constructions specifications). 
                  b.  Where provided, curb and gutter shall be constructed based on city/county construction standards and specifications. 
                  (15)  Roadside ditches. Where curb and gutter is not provided, drainage ditches shall be constructed to provide for proper drainage. Drainage ditches shall have side slopes no steeper than 3:1, and shall be grassed and mulched, sodded, or paved depending on the intended design velocity of stormwater. Drainage ditch construction shall conform to the specifications detailed in applicable city/county construction standards. 
                  (16)  Utility areas. Utilities shall generally be located within the right-of-way and/or easements on both sides of and parallel to the street in accordance with table I-A, I-B. Utility areas shall be planted with grass or ground cover or treated with other suitable cover material. 
                  (17)  Street names and signs. No street name shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with the name of existing streets. Therefore, developers are required to submit their proposed street names to the planning commission. Duplication of street names between the city and county are not to occur except where a street is planned as a continuation of a street between the two jurisdictions. A street which exists or is planned as a continuation of a street shall bear the same name. The planning commission shall have final authority to approve street names in new subdivisions. At least two street name signs shall be placed at each four-way intersection and one at each "T" intersection. Signs shall be free of visual obstructions. Street name signs shall be furnished and installed by the city or county. These shall be paid for by the subdivider prior to the recording of the final plat. 
                  (18)  House numbers/street addresses. House numbers or street addresses shall be provided by the planning commission after preliminary plat approval and a copy of the final plat showing the approved house numbers or street addresses shall be submitted along with the final plat. The planning staff may approve minor corrections or modifications at final review. 
                  (19)  Reserve strips. The creation of fee simple reserve strips to preclude access shall not be permitted. Streets roughly parallel to the boundary line of the subdivision shall be located either on that boundary line or not less than one lot depth from said boundary line. All streets intended to provide the subdivision and adjacent parcels of property with means of ingress and egress shall extend to the boundary line of the subdivision. 
                  (b)  Design criteria. In order to provide for roads of suitable location, width, and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access to police, firefighting, sanitation, and road maintenance equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient system and to avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the following design standards are hereby required. The following design criteria are ideal standards that should be the goal of all design. However, specific site conditions may dictate these goals to be unattainable. In such cases, flexibility will be allowed. 
                  (c)  Design layout. 
                  (1)  General concepts. 
                  a.  All streets shall be located in relation to existing topographic conditions, to public convenience and safety, and to efficient drainage and utility systems. 
                  b.  All streets shall be properly related to special traffic generators such as industrial business districts, schools, churches, and shopping centers, to population densities, and to patterns of existing and proposed land uses. 
                  (2)  Residential streets. 
                  a.  A residential area should be conveniently accessible from arterial streets. 
                  b.  Residential streets shall provide safe and convenient access to housing. 
                  c.  Local streets shall be so laid out as to discourage high speed or through traffic, but the design shall be logical and comprehensive to a motorist or a pedestrian attempting to travel to and through the subdivision. 
                  d.  Curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or looped streets shall be used where such will result in a more desirable layout. 
                  e.  Layout of residential areas should be planned to avoid future need to widen any local streets or minor collector streets. 
                  (3)  Nonresidential streets. 
                  a.  Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic, shall not normally be extended through adjacent existing or potential residential areas. 
                  b.  The streets and other accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings, location of rail facilities, and the provisions of alleys, truck loading and maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas, so as to minimize conflict of movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian. 
                  c.  Streets extending parallel or approximately parallel to a railroad right-of-way should: 
                  1.  Be at a sufficient distance therefrom to ensure depth for commercial or industrial sites, and 
                  2.  Be at a distance at least 50 feet from the railroad right-of-way when intersecting a street which crosses the railroad at grade, or be at such other distance as shall be necessary, when intersecting a street which will be grade separated when crossing the railroad. 
                  (4)  Design speeds for streets. Part of the criteria to be used in the layout and design of streets shall be the following vehicular speed design factors: 

                   
                  *The lower speed within the range shown shall apply specifically to residential areas while commercial and industrial area streets may use the full speed range depending on specific requirements of the development.

                  Editor's note— Printed herein is the Floodplain Management Ordinance of the city, Ordinance No. 09-130, as adopted by the Board of City Commissioners on September 22, 2009. This ordinance repealed the prior floodplain management provisions which appeared at sections 25-101 through 25-162, as amended, in Chapter 25 ("Subdivision Regulations") of the 1985 Code. Amendments to this ordinance are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note to this ordinance indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors in this ordinance have been corrected without notation. The same system of capitalization and expression of numbers in text has been used in this ordinance as it appears in the Code of Ordinances. Additions made to this ordinance for clarity, such as consistent state statute citations and catchline modifications, are indicated by brackets.   In addition, Ord. 09-117, adopted April 28, 2009, approved and adopted the Albany Dougherty Flood Hazard Mitigation Plan. The Plan is not set out at length herein and is on file and available for inspection in the office of the city clerk. 

                  ARTICLE 1. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

                  Section A. - Authorization. 
                  Article IX, section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated [O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a)] have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and board of commissioners of Albany, Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
                  Section B. - Findings of fact. 
                  1.  The flood hazard areas of the City of Albany are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  2.  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
                  Section C. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the intent of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  1.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
                  2.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  3.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
                  4.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage, and; 
                  5.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
                  Section D. - Objectives. 
                  The objectives of this ordinance are: 
                  1.  To protect human life and health; 
                  2.  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  3.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  4.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
                  5.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, street and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  6.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  7.  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area, and; 
                  8.  To insure that flood insurance will continue to be available to the residents of Albany.

                  Flood or flooding : 
                  1.  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  a.  The overflow of inland waters; and 
                  b.  The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source. 
                  2.  The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm or force of nature, such as a flash flood, or by some similarly unusual event which results in flooding as defined in (a) above. 
                  Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM): An official map of a community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where the boundaries of the areas of special flood areas have been defined as zone A.

                  Floor: the top surface of an enclosed area in a building (including basement), i.e., top of slab in concrete slab construction or top of wood flooring in wood frame construction. The term does not include the floor or a garage used solely for parking vehicles. 
                  Lowest floor: the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this ordinance. 
                  Freeboard: Means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade: the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a building.

For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after August 9, 1977 [the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision: means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after August 9, 1977 [the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
                  Non-conforming floodway use: any residential, commercial, industrial, office institutional, or public building located within the floodway on the date of the adoption of these regulations, and which would not be permitted to be constructed within the floodway after the first date (August 9, 1977 in the City of Albany) of the adoption of this ordinance. Any use of land within a floodway existing on the first date of the adoption of this ordinance, and which will not be permitted as a new use within the floodway. 
                  Non-conforming floodway fringe use: any structure that is located within the floodway fringe on the first date of the adoption of this ordinance and that does not meet standards for finished floor elevations and/or flood-proofing that apply to new construction in the floodway fringe. For example, the finished floor elevation of a single family residence might be three feet below the 100 year flood elevation; such a residence should be defined as a non-conforming floodway fringe use. 
                  Person: any individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association or any other organized group of persons, including state and local governments and agencies thereof.

                  Regulatory flood: the flood having a one percent chance of occurring in any given year. The regulatory flood is commonly known as the "100 year flood". 
                  Regulatory flood elevation: the crest elevation in relation to mean sea level expected to be reached by the regulatory flood at any given point in an area of special flood hazard. 
                  Start of construction: means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure: a walled and roofed building that is principally above the ground and affixed to a permanent site, as well as a manufactured home. The term includes a building while in the course of construction, alteration or repair. The term does not include building materials or supplies intended for use in construction, alteration or repair, unless such materials or supplies are within an enclosed building on the premises. The words "building" and "structure" shall have the same meaning for the purposes of this ordinance. 
                  Substantial damage: damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvements: Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, alteration, or other improvement to a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the building official and/or code enforcement official and which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions: is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance: A grant of relief to a person from the requirements of these regulations, as provided in Article 4, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance where specific enforcement of this ordinance would result in exceptional hardship. 
                  Violation: means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  ARTICLE 3. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

                  Section A. - Lands to which this ordinance applies. 
                  This ordinance shall apply to all lands within the City of Albany that are depicted on the flood boundary and floodway map, and the flood insurance rate map as lying within areas of special flood hazard. 
                  Section B. - Basis for area of special flood hazard. 
                  The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS), dated September 25, 2009, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this ordinance. 
                  For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS dated September 25, 2009 with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, for the City of Albany, Georgia are hereby adopted by reference. 
                  Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS. 
                  The repository for public inspection of the Flood Insurance Study (FIS), accompanying maps and other supporting data is located in the office of the planning and development services department. 
                  Section C. - Establishment of a development permit. 
                  A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this ordinance prior to the commencement of any development activities. 
                  Section D. - Compliance. 
                  No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable ordinances. 
                  Section E. - Abrogation and greater restriction. 
                  This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance conflicts or overlaps with any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions, the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
                  Section F. - Interpretation. 
                  In the interpretation and application of this ordinance, all provisions shall be: 
                  1.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
                  2.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
                  3.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
                  Section G. - Relationship between the zoning regulations and floodplain management regulations. 
                  On March 24, 1970, the City of Albany adopted Ordinance #1341. The Floodplain Management Ordinance that is now established imposes additional requirements on the use of property above and beyond those requirements that are stated in the zoning ordinance. Development of lands located within the floodplain shall comply with all of the requirements that are given in this ordinance, as well as with all of those requirements that are given in the zoning ordinance. 
                  The city commission may change the zoning district classification of lands located within the floodplain by following customary rezoning procedures. 
                  Section H. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
                  The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance can not guarantee that areas outside the floodplain's boundaries or land uses that are permitted within the floodplain will be free from flooding or flood damage. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City of Albany or by an officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
                  Section I. - Penalties for violation. 
                  Violation of the provisions of this ordinance or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with the granting of variances or special exceptions shall constitute a misdemeanor.

                  1.  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
                  2.  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with article 4, section B. 
                  7.  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). Areas of special flood hazard established in article 2, section B, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of article 4, section A(4), "Elevated Buildings." 
                  The city engineer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in articles 3(B)(1)(c) and (3)(B)(2). 
                  (3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure.

                  ARTICLE 6. - ESTABLISHMENT OF AREAS WITHIN THE FLOODPLAIN 

                  Section A. - General. 
                  The floodplain within the City of Albany is hereby divided into three separate areas — the floodway, the floodway fringe, and other floodplain areas. 
                  Section B. - Floodway. 
                  1.  Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to the floodway as shown on the official flood maps. 
                  2.  Restrictions governing development in floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in article 3, section B, are areas designated as floodway. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge; 
                  b.  If article 6, section B(2)(a) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of article 5. 
                  c.  Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured home (mobile home) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of article 5, section A(2), and the elevation standards of article 5, section B(1) and the encroachment standards of article 6, section B(2)(a) are met. 
                  3.  Permitted uses. The following and other similar uses normally have a low flood damage potential. These uses are permitted within the floodway provided that they are not prohibited by the Albany-Dougherty County Zoning Ordinance or by any other ordinance, and provided that they do not require fill, dumping of materials or waste, or storage of materials or equipment. No use shall be permitted which acting along or in combination with existing or reasonably foreseeable future uses would result in an increase in the regulatory flood elevation in accordance with article 6, section B(2)(a). 
                  a.  Agricultural uses, including general farming, grazing, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, truck gardening, forestry, sod farming, and wild crop harvesting. 
                  b.  Non-structural industrial and commercial uses, including golf courses, tennis courts, driving range, archery ranges, picnic grounds, boat launching ramps, swimming areas, parks, wildlife and nature preserves, game farms, fish hatcheries, shooting preserves, target ranges, trap and skeet ranges, hunting and fishing areas, hiking and horseback riding rails. 
                  4.  Special uses. The following uses may be permitted only upon application to the department of planning and development services and the issuance of a special use permit by the board of review as provided in article 4 of this ordinance, and provided the applicant demonstrates (by technical analysis) that he/she is in compliance with the provisions of article 6, section B(2)(a); that the use will not cause any increase in the regulatory flood level, and further provided that such uses are permitted at the proposed location by the Albany-Dougherty Zoning Ordinance: 
                  a.  Uses accessory to permitted or special uses; 
                  b.  Circuses, carnivals and similar transient amusement or entertainment; 
                  c.  Drive-in theaters, lots for the sale of new and used cars, trucks, farm equipment, campers and mobile homes; 
                  d.  Extraction of sand, gravel, and other materials; 
                  e.  Railroads, streets, bridges, utility transmission lines, and pipelines; 
                  f.  Marinas, boat rentals, docks, piers, wharves; 
                  g.  Storage yards for non-floatable and readily transportable equipment or machinery; 
                  h.  Other uses which the board of review considers to be similar in nature to those listed elsewhere in this section; and 
                  i.  A single family dwelling or a manufactured home may be constructed on a lot that was on record in the office of the clerk of the Superior Court of Dougherty County, Georgia on the effective date of the first adoption of this ordinance if the lowest floor of that dwelling is at least one foot above the 100 year flood elevation. The method used to raise the structure must not increase the regulatory flood elevation, or obstruct the carrying capacity of the floodway in accordance with article 6, section B(2)(a). 
                  5.  Signs to identify floodway. Wherever the floodway boundary crosses a public road, a sign shall be placed by the City of Albany identifying property located on the river side of the sign as lying within the floodway. 
                  Section C. - Floodway fringe. 
                  1.  Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply to all areas designated as the floodway fringe on the official flood maps. 
                  2.  Subdivision development in the floodway fringe. The plat of each subdivision that is developed in the floodway fringe after the effective date when this ordinance was first adopted shall contain a notation clearly stating the water surface elevation of the 100-year flood in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
                  Section D. - Other floodplain areas. 
                  Standards for streams without established base flood elevation and/or floodways: 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in article 3, section B, where streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where base flood has been provided without floodways, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  1.  No encroachments, including fill material or structures shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
                  2.  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with article 4, section C(1). 
                  (a)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  3.  Where base flood data has been provided but without floodways delineated, new construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall have lowest floor elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  Areas of non-stream related flooding: 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in article 3, section B, are isolated areas designated as unnumbered A-zones on the FIRM maps. These areas may have special flood hazards where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where localized ponding occurs; therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  1.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential buildings shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated, at least one foot above the base flood elevation established by the city engineer. 
                  2.  All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential buildings shall: 
                  a.  Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation established by the city engineer. 
                  b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely flood-proofed to our above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
                  ARTICLE 7. - FLOOD-PROOFING 

                  Section A. - Minimum flood-proofing requirements. 
                  Wherever any of the provisions of this ordinance require that a building be flood-proofed or specify that flood-proofing may be used as an alternative to elevating a structure above the regulatory flood level, flood-proofing shall be deemed to include all of the following: 
                  1.  Wherever possible, the location, construction, and installation of all electrical and gas utility systems in such a manner as to ensure the continuing functioning of those systems in event of a regulatory flood; 
                  2.  The location, construction, and installation of all portable water supply systems in such a manner as to prevent contamination from floodwaters during the regulatory flood. No water supply well shall be located within the foundation walls of a building or structure used for human habitation, medical or educational services, food processing, or public services. 
                  3.  Approved backflow preventers or devices shall be installed on main water service lines at water wells and at all building entry locations to protect the system from backflow or back siphonage of floodwaters or other contaminants. 
                  4.  Sanitary sewer and storm drainage systems that have openings below the regulatory flood elevation shall be equipped with automatic backwater valves or other automatic backflow devices that are installed in each discharge line passing through a building exterior wall. 
                  5.  Sanitary sewer systems, including septic tank systems, that are required to remain in operation during a flood, shall be provided with a sealed holding tank and the necessary isolation and diversion piping, pumps, ejectors, and appurtenances required to prevent sewage discharge during a flood. The holding tank shall be sized for storage of at least two days' demand. 
                  6.  All sewer system vents shall extend to an elevation of at least three feet above the regulatory flood elevation. 
                  7.  A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that any new construction or substantial improvement has been designed to withstand the flood depths, pressure, velocities, impact and uplift forces associated with the regulatory flood at the location of the building. 
                  The certificate shall state that specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure has been flood-proofed. The certificate shall be kept for public inspection in the office of planning and development services. 
                  Section B. - Approval of flood-proofing. 
                  Prior to construction, plans for any structure that is required to be flood-proofed must be submitted to the building inspection department. These plans will be forwarded to the city engineer for review and approval. The city engineer shall review the plans for compliance techniques specified in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers publication entitled "Flood-proofing Regulations," June 1972, GPO: 19730-505-026 and for compliance with any other applicable building codes or regulations. The city engineer shall approve, reject, or recommend modifications of the plans within 15 days from the receipt of the plans.

                  Sec. 16-33. Occupation tax certificate and fee. 
                  Each person, firm, company or corporation engaged in any business, trade, profession or occupation in the city shall pay a license fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) per each year, unless exempted. 
                  Sec. 16-36. Change of address. 
                  Any person moving their business from one location to another shall pay a license transfer fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00). 
                  Sec. 16-1000. Occupational tax schedule; NAICS profitability list. 
                  The fees for Occupational Tax Certificates are calculated by gross receipts of each business and the occupation tax schedule. The annual gross receipts are multiplied by a tax rate percentage. The tax rate percentage is based upon the profitability classification listed beside each type of business. The minimum fee is $ 125.00 and the maximum fee is $ 9,000.00. 
                  Example: A department store (Retail) would fall into the profitability class #2 on the NAICS Profitability List, so they would select the tax rate of .000475 from the Occupation Tax Schedule. The calculation would be: 
                  Gross receipts of $1,500,000 X .000475 = $ 712.50 Amount Due. 
                  Definition of Gross receipts: Gross receipts means total revenue of the business or practitioner for the period, including without being limited to, the following: 
                  (i)  Total income without deduction for the cost of goods sold or expenses incurred; 
                  (ii)  Gain from trading in stocks, bonds, capital assets, or instruments of indebtedness; 
                  (iii)  Proceeds from commissions on the sale of property, goods, or services; 
                  (iv)  Proceeds from fees charged for services rendered; and 
                  (v)  Proceeds from rent, interest, royalty, or dividend income. 
                  Gross receipts shall not include the following: 
                  (i)  Sales, use, or excise taxes;

                  (iii)  Interorganizational sales or transfers between or among the units of a parent subsidiary controlled group of corporations. 

                   
                  The profitability class rate for each business is increased by 20%. Each year beginning 2014 this amount shall increase by the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the preceding year. The CPI is the Consumer Price Index published by the United States Department of Labor - Bureau of Labor Statistics All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). 
                  The due date for occupation taxes is January 31 of each year.
