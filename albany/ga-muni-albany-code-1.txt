THE CODE OF ORDINANCES CITY OF ALBANY, GEORGIA ____________ Published by Order of the Board of City Commissioners 2009 ____________ > OFFICIALS of the CITY OF ALBANY, GEORGIA AT THE TIME OF THIS RECODIFICATION ____________ Willie Adams, Jr., M.D. Mayor ____________ Jon Howard Dorothy Hubbard Morris Gurr Roger Marietta Bob Langstaff, Jr. Tommie Postell City Commissioners ____________ Alfred D. Lott City Manager ____________ C. Nathan Davis City Attorney ____________ Sonja Tolbert City Clerk PREFACE     This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Albany, Georgia.     Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1975 Code, the 1985 Code as supplemented through Ord. No. 07-111, adopted April 24, 2007, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of city commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1975 Code, the 1985 Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.     The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. Chapter and Section Numbering System     The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. Page Numbering System     The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: CHARTER CHT:1 RELATED LAWS RL:1 SPECIAL ACTS SA:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 RELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE RLCT:1 SPECIAL ACTS COMPARATIVE TABLE SACT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  Indexes     The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. Looseleaf Supplements     A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.     Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. Acknowledgments     This publication was under the direct supervision of Jim Jenkins, Code Attorney, and Shelly Hayes, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.     The publisher is most grateful to Alfred D. Lott and city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs. Copyright     All editorial enhancements of this Code are copyrighted by Municipal Code Corporation and the City of Albany, Georgia.

Laws (Act No. 303), page 370. Amendments are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original.

The mayor and the three commissioners from the first, fourth, and sixth wards in office on January 1, 1999, shall complete the two-year terms for which they were elected on the second Monday in January, 2000, and when their successors are elected and qualified.

No person shall be eligible to represent any ward unless he has been a bona fide resident thereof at least three months prior to the election at which he offers himself as a candidate. If any commissioner shall remove his domicile from his ward during his term of office, this shall operate to cause a vacancy in the office of commissioner from that ward. The mayor and mayor pro tem. may reside in any ward.     Each member of said board of city commissioners shall have been a resident of the City of Albany, or a resident of any new area taken into the city, for a period of two years immediately prior to the date as of which he is entitled to qualify; at least 21 years of age, and shall continue a bona fide resident of Albany during his term of office. (c)  Filling of vacancies.

Each commissioner shall before qualifying and entering upon the discharge of his duties take and subscribe upon the minutes of the board the following oath, to-wit:     I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully and uprightly demean myself as a member of the board of city commissioners of the City of Albany during my continuance in office; that I will to the utmost of my skill and ability promote the interest and prosperity of the city, and that I will not willfully and knowingly use or be the cause of using tyrannical means toward any citizen or portions of citizens of the city, so help me God. (g)  Impeachment. The board of city commissioners shall provide by ordinance for the impeachment and trial of any member of the board, who upon conviction of malpractice in office or any willful neglect or abuse the powers and duties of the same, shall be dismissed from office.

Laws, p. 4120, § 1; 1974 Ga. Laws, p. 4013, § 2; 1974 Ga. Laws, p. 4017, § 1; 1982 Ga. Laws, p. 5182, § 1; Ord. No. 1728, § 1, 10-10-1972; Ord. No. 1901, § 2, 7-24-1973; Ord.

Laws, p. 4017, § 1 (Ord. No. 1901, § I, 7-24-1973), purported to amend section 25(13) of the original Act by adding text to the end of it. However, the editor has determined that a scrivener's error occurred in listing which material of the original Act was meant to be amended by the amending ordinance, because section 25 of the original Act did not contain any sub-paragraphs and sub-paragraph (13) of section 24 of the original Act contained a similar subject matter as the amending material appearing in amending ordinance. Thus, at the editor's discretion, sub-paragraph (13) of section 24 has been amended by the provision appearing in 1974 Ga. Laws, p. 4017, § 1 (Ord. No. 1901, § I, 7-24-1973).

The board of city commissioners may, in the interest of public health, safety, order, convenience, comfort, prosperity, or general welfare, adopt by ordinance a plan or plans for the districting or zoning of the city for the purpose of regulating the location of trades, industries, apartment-houses, dwellings, or other uses of property; or for the purpose of regulating the height of the buildings, fences, or other structures; or the area or dimensions of lots or of the yards used in connection with buildings or other structures; or for the purpose of regulating the alignment of buildings or other structures near street frontages. The zoning regulations may be based upon any one or more of the purposes above described. The city may be divided into such number of zones or districts, and such districts may be of such shape and area as the board of city commissioners shall deem best suited to accomplish the purposes of the zoning regulations. In the determination and establishment of districts and regulations, classifications may be based on the nature or character of the trade, industry, profession, or other activity conducted, or to be conducted, upon the premises; the number of persons, families, or other group units to reside in or use buildings; the public, quasi-public, or private nature of the use of premises; or upon any other basis or bases relevant to the promotion of the public health, safety, order, morals, conveniences, prosperity, or welfare. (b)  Five-sevenths vote of board required for adoption, majority for repeal.

Nothing in section 3 of this Act shall prejudice the rights of parties now in litigation as to their right to building permits, nor the rights of parties who have applied to the building inspector or the commissioners of the City of Albany for building permits prior to the passage of this Act, such parties being protected in their legal rights as they existed up to the passage of this Act. (9)  Sewers; extension of gas, water, etc. To construct or extend sewers in any of the streets, alleys or ways of said city or contiguous territory that may hereafter be incorporated, to assess such part of the cost of the same on the real estate abutting in the street, way or alley in which the same may be extended, according to frontage as may seem just and reasonable, and to enforce the payment of same by execution against the abutting real estate and the owner thereof. Before the board of [city] commissioners shall adopt any ordinance providing for said improvements where part of the cost is to be assessed against the property owner as above provided, written notice of the date and time of the meeting of the public works committee of the board of [city] commissioners at which such ordinance will be considered shall be given each affected property owner by mailing said notice to the address of such property owner as shown on the last city property tax return of such property owner, such notice to be placed in the United States mail at least 30 days prior to said meeting. The mailing of the notice above described in the manner above provided shall constitute sufficient notice. If the ordinance providing for such improvements shall receive the unanimous vote of the board of [city] commissioners, and if the board of city commissioners shall not elect to hold the cost of such improvement in abeyance and collect it as a sewer connection charge as hereafter provided, the consent of the property owners shall not be required as a condition to the construction of said improvements or to the assessment of the property owners for the cost or portions of the cost thereof; but if such ordinance shall not receive the unanimous vote of the board of [city] commissioners, the consent of 51 percent or more of the property owners to be assess shall be required. In determining whether the requisite 51 percent or more of the property owners to be assessed has been obtained, an affirmative expression of such consent must be received in writing, signed by the property owner. Said assessments shall be levied only on real estate which is specially benefited by the sewer; that is, on real estate which does not abut any street, alley, or way which already has a sewer capable of adequately serving said real estate, so that where there is "already a sewer in a street, alley or way, abutting any real estate, and said sewer is capable of adequately serving said real estate, the owner and said real estate shall not again be assessed for the construction or extension of a sewer, even though such sewer is constructed or extended in a street, alley or way abutting the real estate. The decision of the board of city commissioners as to adequacy shall be final. In determining whether or not 51 percent of the property owners have consented, property owners who will not be assessed on account of the foregoing paragraph shall be excluded and shall not be considered, effective from the date of the passage of the ordinance making the assessment, and having the same priority. To an execution issued under this paragraph the defendant shall have the right to file an affidavit, denying that the whole or any part of the amount for which execution issued is due and stating what amount he admits to be due; which shall be paid or collected before the affidavit is received, and the affidavit shall be received for the balance, and all such affidavits shall be returned to the Superior Court of Dougherty County and there be tried and determined as in cases of illegality, subject to all the pains and penalties provided for in such cases of illegality for delay. The executions herein provided shall be enforced as in case of executions for paving and the assessment shall have the same lien. And in all cases where street paving or repairing is contemplated on any street or highway in the city in which mains, sewers, gas pipes, or electric wiring pipes are laid, or are to be laid, the city shall have the power by a majority vote of the board of commissioners and without the consent of the property owners to extend such mains, sewers, gas pipes, or electric wiring pipes from the main line to the property line to thereafter avoid the necessity of tearing up the paving to make house connections and to assess and collect the cost of making such property line extension against the property to which said connection is made. The payment of such assessments shall be enforced in the manner in which assessments in cases of street paving are enforced. [parenthetical citation omitted] Whenever the construction or extension of a sanitary sewer does not receive the approval of 51 percent or more of the property owners to be assessed, and the unanimous vote of the board of city commissioners cannot be obtained to proceed with such construction or extension and to assess the same as heretofore provided, the board of city commissioners may nevertheless, by vote of four or more commissioners, order the sewer constructed or extended, and order the costs thereof to be apportioned and assessed against the abutting property owners in the same manner as herein provided in the case of other assessments, the payment thereof to be held in abeyance and collected as an additional sewer connection charge, in addition to all other connection charges and fees, at the time the property owner connects to the sewer. In such case execution shall issue and shall be recorded, and the assessment shall constitute the same lien as herein provided for other sewer construction and extension costs, dating from the adoption of the ordinance providing therefor, but payment shall not be required or demanded until the property owner connects to the sewer. The board of commissioners shall have the power to authorize payment of such costs, when the same becomes due upon connection to the system, in future installments and in such manner and at such rate of interest, not to exceed the maximum lawful rate, as it shall determine. In such case the costs shall continue to be a lien until paid in full, with all due interest. Provided, however, that if any lot or lots is so situated that the installation of the sewer line does not extend the full distance of the frontage of said lot or lots abutting the street, way, alley or easement, thereupon the city commissioners are authorized to assess the entire frontage of the lot or lots, the proportionate share of the costs of said sewer line, and provided further, that in such a case the sewer line shall be extended along frontage abutting street, way, alley or easement, to such a point as will afford the owner of the real estate the most practical and economical connection to the sewer line. [parenthetical citation omitted] In addition to all other authority which the City of Albany has to construct or extend sanitary sewers and to provide for the recovery of the cost thereof, the City of Albany shall have the right, by a majority vote of the board of commissioners (four votes), without the consent of the property owners, to construct or extend sanitary sewers, and to recover the cost of construction through tapping fees, to be computed as follows: The director of the public works department shall keep an accurate record of the cost of construction of such sanitary sewer line, and, upon completion, shall make an official determination of the entire cost thereof. Every person desiring to tap on to said line and receive service therefrom shall pay, at the time of tapping on, a tapping fee which shall be the greater of the following sums: (1)  A fraction of the entire cost of construction as finally determined by the public works director, the enumerator of which shall be the number of feet of property owned by said user abutting on said sanitary sewer line, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of the front footage of property abutting both sides of the sanitary sewer line; or (2)  A fraction of such construction cost, the enumerator of which shall be the estimated demand upon such line by the user in terms of gallons per minute, as determined by or under the direction of the public works director, and the denominator of which shall be the total capacity of said sanitary sewer line in terms of gallons per minute, as determined by the public works director. (10)  Regulate machinery. To regulate all machinery, including stationary and locomotive engines, within the city, and to make all such needful rules and regulations for the same as will guard the citizens or any portion thereof against annoyance by unnecessary volumes of smoke and disagreeable and unnecessary noise. (11)  Marketing in city.

No. 15-101, §§ 3, 4, 1-27-2015) Editor's note— Subsection 2 of the original Act was declared unconstitutional by the Georgia Supreme Court in Reynolds v. Brosnan, 170 Ga. 773, 154 S.E. 264 (1930). Nevertheless, the text of the subsection has been included in this printing for purposes of authenticity. In addition, 1970 Ga. Laws (Act No. 986), p. 2575, § I, purported to strike the text of sub-paragraph (5) of section 35 of the original Act and replace it with a new sub-paragraph (5). However, the editor has determined that a scrivener's error occurred in describing which material of the original Act was meant to be amended by the 1970 Act, because section 35 of the original Act did not contain any sub-paragraphs and sub-paragraph (5) of section 34 of the original Act contained a similar subject matter as the amending material appearing in 1970 Act. Thus, at the editor's discretion, sub-paragraph (5) of section 34 has been amended by the provision appearing in 1970 Ga. Laws (Act No. 986), p. 2575, § I. Furthermore, the Georgia Assembly enacted the provisions of 1929 Ga. Laws (Act No. 245), p. 797, § 3, as amending the original Act, but they did not list any specific location for these amendatory provisions within the original Act relative to the other sections. Placement of these amendatory provisions and designation of them as subsections (8-A)(a)—(c) of section 34 was at the discretion of the editor. Furthermore, the Georgia Assembly enacted a provision of 1941 Ga. Laws (Act No. 24), p. 1010, § 2, as amending section 34 of the original Act, but they did not list any specific location for this amendatory provision within the original Act relative to the other subsections. Placement of this amendatory provision and designation of it as subsection (15) of section 34 was at the discretion of the editor. Moreover, the Georgia Assembly enacted a provision of 1964 Ga. Laws (Act No. 521), p. 2009, § 1 as a new subsection under section 34 of the original Act, but they did not provide any specific designation for this new subsection within the original Act relative to the other 15 subsections existing at that time. The General Assembly later repealed and replaced this provision with another through Ord. No. 80-109, § 1, adopted 2-12-80 (1981 Ga. Laws (Act No. 521), p. 5046, § 1), but designated the new provision as subsection 22 of section 34. Furthermore, the Georgia Assembly enacted a provision of Ord. No. 1869, § 1, adopted May 22, 1973 (1974 Ga. Laws, p. 4009, § 1) as an amendment to section 34 of the original Act, and only designated that it be numbered as subsection 18, "or the number next following the last number of said section 34 as amended." Designation of this amendatory provision as subsection (21) of section 34 was at the discretion of the editor. 
Sec. 35. - Levy and sale of property outside corporate limits.     In any case where the defendant in execution has no property within the City of Albany, then and in that event any execution issued by authority of the city for the enforcement of the payment of any sum for taxes, special assessments, fines or otherwise, may be levied and enforced in any county in the state in which property of the defendant may be found and for such purpose the mayor or treasurer shall cause such execution to be directed to any sheriff or constable of the state, and it shall be the duty of any levying officer into whose hands said execution may be placed to promptly enforce the same in the same manner as other executions are enforced with reference to levy, advertisement and sale. 
Sec. 36. - Municipal abattoirs; inspection of meats.     The City of Albany shall have power and authority to own and operate for reasonable profit a municipal abattoir at any place within its corporate limits proper, or its police jurisdiction, to fix and collect regular fees for the slaughter of cattle, hogs, sheep or other meat intended for human consumption therein; to prescribe any and all regulations and rules governing the operation of said abattoir and the reception of stock therein, and in connection with the operation of same shall have the power to fully regulate or prohibit any other abattoir or slaughter house or similar place where cattle or other meat is slaughtered for market within its corporate and police limits, and to prescribe the location and the manner and kind of construction of the same; or said city shall have the power to prohibit the operation of any abattoir, slaughter house or other place where stock is slaughtered within the corporate and police limits; and in connection with the said municipal abattoir, said city shall have the power to prohibit by penal ordinance the sale or having on hand for sale, within its corporate or police limits, any fresh or green meats, not slaughtered in its abattoir, unless it has been slaughtered in an abattoir or similar place of equal facilities and methods as that of the city's or of such standard as the city may by ordinance prescribe, or unless it bears valid and satisfactory evidence of a state or federal favorable inspection; and said city shall have the power to provide for rigid inspection of all green or fresh meats sold or offered for sale or on hand for sale, within the city's corporate or police limits, so as to insure a strict conformity to its laws and ordinances governing the introduction thereof into the city; and shall have the power to confiscate and destroy all tainted meats found on the market of the city, and to confiscate all meats found within said limits brought in contrary to the laws and ordinances of the city. 
Sec. 37. - Enumeration of powers not restrictive.     The enumeration of power contained in this Act shall not be construed as restrictive, but the City of Albany and its municipal authorities may exercise all powers, rights and jurisdictions as they might if such enumerations were not made, and the board of city commissioners may pass all laws and ordinances, rules and regulations they may deem needful and proper for the general welfare of said city, and where, under this charter, rights are conferred or powers granted, but the manner of exercising them is not fully prescribed the board of city commissioners may prescribe the method of exercising them, or they may prescribe additional regulations and modes of procedure not repugnant to the intents and purposes of this Act, nor the laws of the state. 
Sec. 37-A. - Municipal planning board. (a)  Creation; composition. There shall be created as part of the government of the City of Albany a board to be known as the municipal planning board, which board shall consist of not less than three and not more than seven members, to be appointed by the board of city commissioners and to have such terms (not to exceed four years) as the board of city commissioners may determine.

The planning board shall have power to recommend or make suggestions to the board of city commissioners concerning the laying out, widening, extending and location of streets; sidewalks, and boulevards; the relief of traffic conditions; development of housing and sanitary conditions; and the establishment of zones or districts, to make suggestions concerning the use, height, area and bulk of buildings or structures; to study and propose such measures as may be advisable for the promotion of public interests, health, morals, safety, comfort, convenience and welfare of said city, and in addition thereto, shall have such additional authority as may be provided by law, or conferred upon said board by ordinances passed by the board of city commissioners of the City of Albany. (c)  Appropriation; gifts or bequests. The board of city commissioners shall make such appropriations for carrying out the work of said planning board in like manner and form as appropriations are made to other departments of said city.

When any gifts, bequests or devises are made to the said municipal planning board, the said board shall have full, complete and final control and disposition of same, and the said gifts shall not pass into the city treasury or otherwise be counted as part of the revenue of the city. (1924 Ga. Laws (Act No. 331), p. 397, § 3; 1949 Ga. Laws (Act No. 27), p. 103, § 1) Editor's note— The Georgia legislature enacted the provisions of 1924 Ga. Laws (Act No. 331), p. 397, § 3, as amending the original 1923 Act without reference to a specific location relative to the other sections of the original 1923 Act. Placement of these provisions at Section 37-A this location, was at the discretion of the editor. This planning board has been succeeded by the Albany-Dougherty Planning commission, which was established by Ordinance No. 85-167, adopted May 30, 1985. 
Sec. 38. - Act of 1906 not repealed.     All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this Act be and the same are hereby repealed; Provided, that nothing in this Act contained shall operate to effect or repeal the Act of the General Assembly of Georgia, approved August 21, 1906, entitled "An Act to provide for a system of public schools in and for the City of Albany, Dougherty County, Georgia; to empower and require the mayor and council of said city to levy and collect a special tax for the maintenance and support of same; to establish a board of education to conduct the same; to define the powers of said board; to provide for ratification of the Act by election, and for other purposes," which said Act is hereby declared to be and remain of full force and effect [1906 Ga. Laws (Act No. 548), p. 488]. 
Sec. 39. - Election for ratification of charter.     Before this Act shall become effective the same shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the City of Albany at an election to be held for that purpose on October 8, 1923. Said election shall in all respects be held and the results declared by the mayor and council or by those discharging the duties of such, under the present rules and regulations governing ordinary city elections, provided that instead of opening the registration books 45 days prior to said election said registration books need not be opened more than 35 days prior to said election and continue open for 30 days. Those so registering and qualified to vote in said election need not register again in order to vote in the general election to be held in said city on the first Monday in December, 1923 (or any primary election therefor), but if otherwise qualified shall be deemed qualified voters in said general election. Those voters desiring to vote in favor of this Act shall have written or printed upon their ballots the words "For Commission Manager Bill," and those voters desiring to vote against this bill shall have written or printed on their ballots "Against Commission Manager Bill." If a majority of those voting in said election shall vote in favor of this bill, this bill shall, as to those Acts and things, the performance or happening of which is postponed until that date, become of force and effect on the second Monday in January, 1924, and, as to those Acts and things the performance or happening of which is required prior to said second Monday in January, 1924, shall become of force and effect at such time or times as will insure the prompt performance or happening of said Acts and things. (a)  The managers and clerks of said special election (and one alternate for each to serve in case the person designated does not act) shall be chosen by the mayor and council of the city, or those discharging the duties of such, at least three days before the election, and those favoring the adoption of the Act and those opposed thereto shall have as nearly equal representation among said managers and clerks as is possible; that is to say, if two managers are chosen from among those who favor the adoption of said Act, then two of the clerks shall be chosen from among those opposed thereto, and vice versa. And in choosing said clerks and managers, and alternates for each, said authorities shall as far as possible act upon responsible recommendations made by the chairman or committee of those citizens favoring the adoption of said Act and the chairman or committee of those citizens opposing the adoption of said Act. 
Sec. 39-A. - Retirement age for municipal employees.     Every employed municipal officer or employee of the City of Albany shall be retired upon reaching 65 years of age; provided, that in the event municipal employees are included under the provisions of the United States Social Security Act, no municipal officer or employee who is employed at the time of such inclusion shall be retired at the age of 65 if such retirement would disqualify such person from obtaining the benefits of social security. Instead, such employee shall be allowed to continue his employment until he qualifies for social security at which time he shall be retired. (1956 Ga. Laws (Act No. 252), p. 2762, § 1) Editor's note— The requirement in Section 39-A mandating a retirement age for all municipal officers and employees is a prima facie violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"), 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. However, the text of this section has been printed for purposes of authenticity. 
Sec. 40. - Authority to insure city employees; appropriation of funds.     The City of Albany shall have the power and authority to enter into contracts of insurance with any insurance company authorized to transact business in the State of Georgia, insuring the employees of the city, or any class or group of city employees, under a policy or policies of group insurance, granting annuities, hospital and sick insurance. The city is authorized to appropriate funds of the city for any and all such purposes sufficient to pay any part or all of the premium charges incident to the issuance of group insurance and for the continuation of such policy or policies. (1950 Ga. Laws (Act No. 595), p. 2149, § 1) Editor's note— The Georgia legislature enacted the provisions of 1950 Ga. Laws (Act No. 595), p. 2149, § 1, as a new section amending the original 1923 Act without reference to a specific location relative to the other sections of the original 1923 Act. Placement of the provision at this location and designation of it as Section 40, was at the discretion of the editor. Section 40 of the original 1923 Act provided for the repeal of all conflicting laws. 
Sec. 41. - Board of city commissioners to determine type of insurance; amount, etc.     The board of city commissioners is hereby vested with full and complete power and authority to determine the amount of contribution by the city for the purchase of group insurance for employees of the city, the amount and kind of insurance, what class of employees are to be included, and to determine any and all facts relating to the purchase of group insurance, and to enter into contracts accordingly. (1950 Ga. Laws (Act No. 595), p. 2149, § 2) Editor's note— The Georgia legislature enacted the provisions of 1950 Ga. Laws (Act No. 595), p. 2149, § 2, as a new section amending the original 1923 Act and following the section enacted by section 1 of the 1950 Act. Designation of it as Section 41, was at the discretion of the editor. Furthermore, 1981 Ga. Laws, pp. 5048, 5049, § 1 (Ord. No. 80-117, § 1, 2-26-1980) purported to amend the Charter and 1943 Ga. Laws (Act No. 105), p. 1154, by adding an amendatory provision allowing "the transfer to the City of Albany Pension Fund of the interest or equity of any newly employed city manager in any and all other employee pension trusts or funds." However, the original 1923 Act creating the Charter did not contain any amendatory provision from the 1943 Act or any subject matter concerning municipal employee pensions. Therefore, the provisions of the 1981 amendatory ordinance were not included in this printing of the Charter, at the discretion of the editor.

Sec. E-3. - Definitions.     As used in this Act, the following words and terms shall have the following meanings, unless a different meaning clearly appears from the context: (a)  The word "Authority" shall mean the "Albany Dougherty Payroll Development Authority" created by this Act and by and under Article V, Section IX, Paragraph I of the Constitution of the State of Georgia. (b)  The word "project" shall be deemed to mean and include the acquisition of lands, properties and improvements for development, expansion and promotion of jobs and payrolls in industry, commerce, agriculture, and natural resources; the construction of buildings and plants or the acquisition of equipment for the purpose of selling, leasing or renting such structures or equipment to private persons, firms or corporations.     The word 'Project' shall also include the acquisition, construction, improvement or modification of any property, real or personal used as air or water pollution control facilities which any federal, state, or local agency having jurisdiction in the premises shall have certified as necessary for the continued operation of the industry or industries which the same is to serve and is necessary for the public welfare. For purposes hereof, the term 'air pollution control facility' means any property used primarily to abate or control atmospheric pollution or contamination by removing, containing, altering, disposing or storing of atmospheric pollutants or contaminants if such facility is in furtherance of federal, state, or local standards for control of atmospheric pollution or contaminants. For the purpose hereof, the term `water pollution control facility' means any property used primarily to control water pollution by removing, storing, altering, or disposing of pollutants, contaminants, wastes or heat, including the necessary intercepting sewers, outfall sewers, pumping, power and other equipment, holding ponds, lagoons and their appurtenances, if such facility is in the furtherance of federal, state, or local standards for the control of water pollution."     The word `Project' shall also include the acquisition, construction, leasing, and equipping of new industrial facilities, and the improvement, modification, acquisition, expansion, modernization, leasing, equipping, and remodeling of existing industrial facilities located or to be located within the area of operation of the Authority. (c)  The term "cost of project" shall embrace the cost of construction, the cost of all lands, properties, easements, rights and franchises acquired, the cost of machinery and equipment, financing charges, interest prior to and during construction and for one year after completion of construction, cost of engineering, architectural and legal expenses, and plans and specifications and other expenses necessary or incident to determining the feasibility or practicability of the project, administrative expenses, and such other expenses as may be necessary or incident to the financing herein authorized, the construction of any project and placing the same in operation; provided, however, that in no event shall entertainment or promotional expense be considered a part of the cost of any project.     It is the intention here that funds the Authority may borrow and the interest paid thereon, for interim or temporary financing for any of the above-named items properly included in "cost of project" for the use of a designated project, pending the issue and validation of revenue anticipation bonds for such project, shall be considered a "cost of project" which may be paid or repaid from the proceeds of the revenue anticipation bonds authorized herein in section 6(l). (1958 Ga. Laws (Act No. 260), p. 2870, § 3; 1962 Ga. Laws (Act No. 800), p. 2778, § 1) Editor's note— 1975 Ga. Laws (Act No. 211), p. 3172, § 1, purported to enact a new paragraph at the end of subsection (b) of section 2 of the 1958 Ga. Laws (Act No. 260), p. 2870. However, the editor has determined that a scrivener's error occurred regarding which section of the 1958 Act the new paragraph should be added, because section 2 of the 1958 Act does not contain any subsections while section 3 of the 1958 Act contains subsections (a)—(c). Therefore, the new paragraph added by the 1975 Act was placed at the end of subsection (c) of section 3, at the discretion of the editor. Moreover, 1979 Ga. Laws (Act No. 182), p. 3639, § 1, purported to enact a new paragraph at the end of subsection (b) of section 2 of the 1958 Ga. Laws (Act No. 260), p. 2870. However, the editor has determined that a scrivener's error occurred regarding which section of the 1958 Act the new paragraph should be added, because section 2 of the 1958 Act does not contain any subsections while section 3 of the 1958 Act contains subsections (a)—(c). Therefore, the new paragraph added by the 1979 Act was placed at the end of subsection (c) of section 3, at the discretion of the editor. 
Sec. E-4. - Contracts.     The County of Dougherty and the City of Albany are expressly authorized to enter into contracts with the Authority as a public corporation. (1958 Ga. Laws (Act No. 260), p. 2870, § 4) 
Sec.

In case any officer whose signature shall appear on the bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before delivery of such bonds, such signature shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until delivery, and such bonds may, nevertheless, be issued and delivered as though the person who signed or sealed such bonds had not ceased to be such officer, and any of such bonds may be executed and sealed on behalf of said Authority by such officers who may, at the time of the execution of such bonds, hold the proper offices of said Authority although on the date of such bonds or on the date of any lawful proceedings taken in connection therewith such persons may not have held such offices. (d)  All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall be and are hereby declared to be negotiable under the laws of the State of Georgia, subject to provisions for registration. (e)  The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the Authority and the proceeds derived from the sale of such bonds shall be used solely for the purpose provided in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of such bonds. (f)  Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates or temporary bonds, with or without coupons exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. (g)  The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds and coupons which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. (h)  Such revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified required hereunder. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions hereof shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the Authority. (i)  The revenue bonds or obligations herein authorized to be issued shall not be deemed to constitute a debt (within the meaning of Article IX, Section VII, Paragraph I of the Constitution of the State of Georgia of 1976) of the State of Georgia, the City of Albany, the County of Dougherty, or the Authority, or a pledge of the faith and credit of said State, City, County, nor shall said State, City, or County be subject to any pecuniary liability thereon. (j)  In the discretion of the Authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the State. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the Authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insuring of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies; and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the Authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds; and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other monies be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this State or of the United States to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. Any resolution adopted by the Authority or any indenture of trust, trust agreement, or other instrument executed by the Authority may contain such terms and provisions as the Authority shall approve. Such approval of the Authority shall be conclusively established by the execution of any such resolution, indenture of trust, trust agreement, or other instrument by the chairman or vice chairman of the Authority and the attestation of such execution by the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Authority. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture. (1981 Ga.

The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, or in the trust indenture, any surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued.

Sec. G-12. - Validation.     Bonds of the Authority shall be confirmed and validated in accordance with the procedure of the Revenue Bond Law of the State of Georgia, as heretofore or hereafter amended. The petition for validation shall also make a party defendant to such action any political subdivision or instrumentality of the State of Georgia which has contracted with the Authority for the services and facilities of the project for which bonds are to be issued and sought to be validated and any such political subdivision or instrumentality shall be required to show cause, if any exists, why such contract or contracts and the terms and conditions thereof should not be inquired into by the court and the contract or contracts adjudicated as security for the payment of any such bonds of the Authority.

G-13. - Interest of Bondholders Protected.     The Authority shall have perpetual existence, and, while any of the bonds issued by the Authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties or existence of said Authority or of its officers, employees or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds.
