PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Fitzgerald, Georgia, of a general and permanent nature. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1966 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1966 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
This 2007 republication includes all amendatory legislation through Ord. No. 07-1373, adopted April 9, 2007, and was accomplished under the supervision of Lennon Akins, Editor. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the third section of Chapter 4 is 4-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 4-1 and 4-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-1.1, 4-1.2 and 4-1.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 13.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor, and Robert Coutre', Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

Receipt of a negative drug test result is required prior to employment. If an applicant refuses to be tested or fails the pre-employment drug test, the applicant will be disqualified for employment for a period of six (6) months. A negative pre-employment drug test is required prior to further consideration for employment. 
(2)  Post-accident testing. Conducted after accidents on safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive employees if there was loss of life, an injury requiring transportation to a medical treatment facility, one (1) or more vehicles incurs disabling damage where a vehicle must be towed from the scene and the employee receives a citation under state or local law for a moving traffic violation, or if the employees' performance could have contributed to the accident. Any safety-sensitive or non-safety-sensitive employee whose performance could have contributed to the accident, as determined by the city using the best information available at the time of the accident, will be given a drug and alcohol test. Post-accident drug and alcohol tests must be conducted as soon as possible after the accident. Drug tests must be performed within thirty-two (32) hours after the accident. Alcohol tests must be performed within three (3) hours after the accident. 
(3)  Reasonable cause. All safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive employees may be subject to a fitness for duty evaluation, and urine and/or breath testing when there are reasons to believe that drug or alcohol use is adversely affecting job performance. A reasonable suspicion referral for testing will be made on the basis of documented objective facts and circumstances which are consistent with the short-term effects of substance abuse. Examples of reasonable cause include, but are not limited to, the following: 
a.  Physical signs and symptoms consistent with prohibited substance use. 
b.  Evidence of the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of controlled substances, drugs, alcohol, or other prohibited substances.

(4)  Random. Conducted on all employees, whether or not they perform safety-sensitive functions, on a random, unannounced basis. 
(5)  Return-to-duty. Safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive employees who have previously refused to take a drug or alcohol test, or failed such a test, shall be tested for prohibited drug or alcohol use before they return to duty. The employee must first be certified by a substance abuse professional (SAP) as capable of resuming duties. Any such employee, once returned to duty may be administered unannounced follow-up drug and alcohol tests for up to sixty (60) months after their return to duty. 
(6)  Follow-up. Once allowed to return to duty, safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive employees shall be subject to unannounced follow-up testing for at least twelve (12) but not to exceed sixty (60) months. The frequency and duration of the follow-up testing will be recommended by the SAP as long as a minimum of six (6) tests are performed during the first twelve (12) months after the employee returns to duty.

(Ord. No. 99-1260, § V, 11-9-99)

Sec. 4-268. - Prohibition of certain types of entertainment, attire and conduct. 
(a)  Findings; public purpose. Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Richmond County, Georgia; Amarillo, Texas; Austin, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Houston, Texas; Renton, Washington; Phoenix, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; St. Paul, Minnesota; Tucson, Arizona; Augusta, Georgia; LaGrange, Georgia; Dalton and Whitfield County, Georgia; Carrollton, Georgia; Smyrna, Georgia; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences the mayor and council believe are relevant to the problems faced by the City of Fitzgerald, the mayor and council take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of the mayor and council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest, and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. To that end, this section is hereby adopted. 
(b)  Enactment. The following types of entertainment, attire and conduct are prohibited upon any premises licensed to sell, serve or disperse liquor by the drink: 
(1)  The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of liquor by the drink while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing, as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or any portion of the male or female pubic hair, anus, cleft or the buttocks, vulva and genitals.

Examples of structural erosion and sediment control practices are riprap, sediment basins, dikes, level spreaders, waterways or outlets, diversions, grade stabilization structures and sediment traps, etc. Such practices can be found in the publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
Trout streams: All streams or portions of streams within the watershed as designated by the Wildlife Resources Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources under the provisions of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. 12-5-20, in the rules and regulations for Water Quality Control, Chapter 391-3-6 at www.gaepd.org. Streams designated as primary trout waters are defined as water supporting a self-sustaining population of rainbow, brown or brook trout. Streams designated as secondary trout waters are those in which there is no evidence of natural trout reproduction, but are capable of supporting trout throughout the year. First order trout waters are streams into which no other streams flow except springs. 
Vegetative erosion and sedimentation control measures: Measures for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by covering the soil with: 
(1)  Permanent seeding, sprigging or planting, producing long-term vegetative cover; or 
(2)  Temporary seeding, producing short-term vegetative cover; or 
(3)  Sodding, covering areas with a turf of perennial sod-forming grass. 
Such measures can be found in the publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
Watercourse: Any natural or artificial watercourse, stream, river, creek, channel, ditch, canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, ravine, or wash in which water flows either continuously or intermittently and which has a definite channel, bed and banks, and including any area adjacent thereto subject to inundation by reason of overflow or floodwater. 
Wetlands: Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.

(Ord. No. 11-1429, § III, 5-9-11) 
Sec. 10-4. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the chapter and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 10-4(b) and (c) of this chapter. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this chapter and the NPDES general permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections 10-4(b) and (c) of this chapter shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections 10-4(c)(15) and (c)(16) of this chapter, in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 10-4(b)(2) of this chapter; 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: That under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. Shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 10-4(b) and (c)of this chapter. 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 11-1429, § IV, 5-9-11) 
Sec. 10-5. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Fitzgerald without first obtaining a permit from the City of Fitzgerald Building Inspector to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City of Fitzgerald and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 10-5(c) of this chapter. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 10-4(b) and (c) of this chapter will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three (3) copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
(3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 10-4(c)(15) and (c)(16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 10-5(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(5)  If a permit applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits, this chapter section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three (3) years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 10-4(b) and (c) of this chapter, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-20. 
(2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
(d)  Permits. 
(1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this chapter, any variances required by subsections 10-4(c)(15) and (c)(16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 10-5(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this chapter, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this chapter. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three (3) years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(f)(1). 
(Ord. No. 11-1429, § V, 5-9-11) 
Sec. 10-6. - Inspection and enforcement. 
(a)  The City of Fitzgerald will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this chapter, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. 
(b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within twelve (12) months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
(c)  The City of Fitzgerald shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this chapter, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
(d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
(e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a). The districts or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
(f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have ninety (90) days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within ninety (90) days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority. 
(Ord. No. 11-1429, § VI, 5-9-11) 
Sec. 10-7. - Penalties and incentives. 
(a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this chapter without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
(b)  Stop-work orders. 
(1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this chapter, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five (5) days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five (5) days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning;

Chapter 10.5 - WETLANDS PROTECTION DISTRICTS[1] 

Footnotes:

State Law reference— Georgia Natural Areas Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-3-90 et seq.; Georgia water resources, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-1 et seq.; Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.; Comprehensive Statewide Water Management Planning Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-520 et seq. 

Sec. 10.5-1. - Purpose. 
Based on the department of natural resources part V environmental planning standards and the findings of the 2010 Joint Ben Hill County-City of Fitzgerald Comprehensive Plan, it has been determined that the wise management of the wetlands as defined in this section is essential to maintaining the health, safety, welfare and economic well-being of the public, and to provide a guide for future growth and development in the wetlands protection districts as defined. 
The wetlands in City of Fitzgerald are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia. 
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
The purpose of this section is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. 
(Ord. No. 03-1319, § 10A-1, 6-30-03) 
Sec. 10.5-2. - Definitions. 
Generalized wetlands means the data sets contained on the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands inventory maps, which are utilized to develop the wetlands protection districts overlay map for the City of Fitzgerald, Georgia. 
Jurisdictional wetland means an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetlands boundaries by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. Subscript 1344, as amended. 
Regulated activity means any activity, which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. 
(Ord. No. 03-1319, § 10A-2, 6-30-03) 
Sec. 10.5-3. - Establishment of the wetlands protection district. 
The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Fitzgerald, Georgia that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's national wetlands inventory maps. These wetlands areas are depicted on the wetlands protection districts overlay map. 
The generalized wetland areas depicted on the wetlands protection districts overlay map do not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the City of Fitzgerald, Georgia and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this chapter does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
(Ord. No. 03-1319, § 10A-3, 6-30-03) 
Sec. 10.5-4. - Protection criteria. 
Requirement for local permit or permission. No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the City of Fitzgerald, Georgia. If the area proposed for development is located within fifty (50) feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the zoning administrator and/or his designee using the wetlands protection districts overlay map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued. 
(Ord. No. 03-1319, § 10A-4, 6-30-03) 
Sec. 10.5-5. - Permitted uses. 
The following uses shall be allowed as of right within the wetlands protection districts to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein. [The activities listed in this section are exempted from Section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 permit. However, under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances.] 
(1)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 Permit. 
(2)  Outdoor passive recreation activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
(3)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices (BMP's) approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec. 11.5-1. - Authorization. 
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Fitzgerald, of Ben Hill County, Georgia, does ordain as set out in the following sections. 
(Ord. No. 09-1407, § 1, 8-10-09) 
Sec. 11.5-2 - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of City of Fitzgerald, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 09-1407, § 1, 8-10-09) 
Sec. 11.5-3. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(Ord. No. 09-1407, § 1, 8-10-09) 
Sec. 11.5-4. - Objectives. 
The objectives of this chapter are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
(7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

ARTICLE V. - VARIANCE PROCEDURES 

Sec. 11.5-51. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The zoning board of appeals as established by the mayor and council and the Ben Hill County Board of Commissioners shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the zoning administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the zoning board of appeals may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Ben Hill County, Georgia, as provided in section 5-4-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the zoning board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
(h)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The zoning administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the zoning board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank.

"Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

State Law reference— Public drunkenness, O.C.G.A. § 16-11-41. 
Sec. 18-79. - Smoking in public facilities. 
(a)  Findings and intent. The city council does hereby find that: 
(1)  Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute determined in 1999, that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of up to sixty-five thousand (65,000) Americans annually. (National Cancer Institute (NCI), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke: the report of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph 10," Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI), August 1999.) 
(2)  The Public Health Service's National Toxicology Program has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen. (Environmental Health Information Service (EHIS), "Environmental tobacco smoke: first listed in the Ninth Report on Carcinogens," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Public Health Service, National Toxicology Program, 2000.) 
(3)  Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people, individuals with cardiovascular disease, and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities, and cancer. (California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal EPA), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke", Tobacco Control 6(4): 346-353, Winter, 1997.) 
(4)  The Americans With Disabilities Act, which requires that disabled persons have access to public places and workplaces, deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability. (Daynard, R.A., "Environmental tobacco smoke and the Americans with Disabilities Act," Nonsmokers' Voice 15(1): 8-9.) 
(5)  The U.S. Surgeon General has determined that the simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, the exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke. (Department of Health and Human Services. The Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking: A Report of the Surgeon General. Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control, 1986.) The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that secondhand smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels by high rates of ventilation. Air cleaners, which are only capable of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke, do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand smoke. (Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), "Indoor air facts no. 5: environmental tobacco smoke," Washington, D.C.: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), June 1989.) 
(6)  A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled offices suffer a twenty-five (25) percent to fifty (50) percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function. (Pitsavos, C.; Panagiotakos, D.B.; Chrysohoou, C.; Skoumas, J.; Tzioumis, K.; Stefanadis, C.; Toutouzas, P., "Association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and the development of acute coronary syndromes: the CARDIO2000 case-control study," Tobacco Control 11(3): 220-225, September 2002.) 
(7)  Smoke-filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease, lower productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs, increased health insurance rates, and increased liability claims for diseases related to exposure to secondhand smoke. ("The high price of cigarette smoking," Business and Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.) 
(8)  Accordingly, the city council finds and declares that the purposes of this section are to protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in all public facilities in the City of Fitzgerald; to guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air; and to recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.

Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the city.

(k)  The lien provided for in subparagraph (g) of this section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of the superior court of Ben Hill County, Georgia, and shall relate back to the date of the filing of any lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(g). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket.

Chapter 4 of Title 48; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires twelve (12) months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the mayor and council of the City of Fitzgerald. Thirty (30) days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
(l)  The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by this article unless such costs are waived by resolution of the board of commissioners of Ben Hill County. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
(m)  The City of Fitzgerald may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
(n)  Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
(o)  In addition to the foregoing procedures and remedies, the code enforcement officer or his delegate may may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by the city by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and seek to enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this section.

The City of Fitzgerald recognizes that, from time to time, a certain individual, business, or organization may make historical, cultural, or other important contributions to the City of Fitzgerald, State of Georgia or the United States that merit recognition in the form of renaming a street within the city in such individuals honor. This article prescribes the protocol and procedure by which existing streets or public places within the City of Fitzgerald may be renamed in honor of the aforementioned deserving individuals, businesses, or organizations, while at the same time, preserving the integrity of those existing streets and public places that have already been historically named or dedicated.

With respect to the changing of the name of an existing street or dedication of a public place owned by the city and located within the corporate limits of the City of Fitzgerald, the mayor and council shall be required to follow the following procedures with respect to the changing of the name of an existing street: 
(1)  By application of a citizen or group of citizens. 
a.  A citizen or group of city citizens may submit an application to change the name of an existing street hereunder. Such application shall be on forms prescribed by the city clerk. Such application shall not be considered unless at least seventy-five (75) percent of the persons owning real property abutting such existing street submit a written application to the city clerk requesting that the name of such existing street be changed. 
b.  Such application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00), which is intended to cover administrative and other costs which are anticipated to be incurred by the city in connection with its consideration of the application. Such application fee shall be deposited in the general fund of the city. 
c.  The mayor and council of the city shall consider such application and act thereon in accord with this division no later than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the date of submission of such application to the city clerk. 
d.  Upon receipt of the application by the city clerk, the city clerk shall proceed to validate the application. The city clerk shall validate the application by verifying that the proper number of signatures is contained on the application and that the persons signing the application are owners of real property abutting said street as required by this division. In the event that the city clerk determines that the application is invalid for any reason, or that the application does not contain sufficient signatures, the application shall be returned to the person or persons submitting such application, and it shall not be subject to further consideration by the mayor and council until such time as a new application is submitted and the city clerk validates the new application. 
e.  In determining the required percentage of the persons signing such application in connection with the validation thereof, where property abutting such street is owned by more than one (1) person, the signature of only one (1) such owner shall be counted in calculating such seventy-five (75) percent. In addition, persons who rent or lease real property abutting such street may sign such application, but their signatures shall not be counted toward the seventy-five (75) percent threshold for submission of the application to the mayor and council. Signatures on any such application signed more than ninety (90) calendar days prior to the date of submission of the application to the city clerk shall be invalid and shall not be counted toward the seventy-five (75) percent threshold. In the event that more than one (1) application for changing the name of an existing street is presented to the city clerk, the city clerk shall validate such applications in the order received. The first application validated by the city clerk shall be presented to the mayor and council first, and only if the resolution to approve the application is denied shall the city clerk present the second or subsequent validated application to the mayor and council. 
f.  The application shall be in such form as established by the city clerk. At a minimum, the application shall indicate thereon the location of the street, the proposed new name of the street, the printed name, street address, and signature of each property owner signing such application, and the date that each property owner signed the application. In addition, each such application shall include therewith a written statement which provides, in succinct detail, the reasons for the proposed street name change in honor of a particular person or business listed in the application. In providing such written statement, the criteria to be considered by the mayor and council regarding the changing of the name of such street as more particularly established in this division shall be specifically addressed by the application in such written statement accompanying the street name changing application. In addition, the application shall also list any public announcement or public recognition request that should accompany any official street name changing ceremony undertaken by the city in connection with the changing of the name of such street. 
g.  In the event that the city clerk determines that the application is valid, then prior to the submission of the application to the mayor and council, the city clerk shall undertake the following: 
1.  Provide notification of the application to and compile for review by the mayor and council responses to the application from the following:

v.  Said notified agencies and departments shall respond to said notice within fourteen days of receipt of said notice. Said response shall include said agency or department's position regarding name change and support for said position. 
2.  Review existing public records for the purpose of establishing that the proposed name does not duplicate any existing street name and is not confusingly similar to any existing street name in the City of Fitzgerald, Georgia or Ben Hill County, Georgia. 
h.  Upon the completion of the foregoing, the city clerk shall be required to place consideration of the application on the agenda for a city council meeting within ninety (90) days from the date the application was finally validated. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the tabling of such proposal by the mayor and council, but in no event shall consideration of such proposal by the city council be delayed beyond one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after the validated application was filed with the city clerk. 
i.  Prior to the mayor and council considering or voting upon such application, the mayor and council shall hold a public hearing regarding such application. Notice of such public hearing shall be published once in the city's legal organ no later than the day prior to the date of the public hearing. Not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the date set for the public hearing signage displaying public notice hereinafter described shall be erected on along the street of the proposed renaming. Such sign shall be erected within ten (10) feet of said street in such a manner as may be readily seen by the public. Such public notice shall advise the public regarding the application, the proposed new street name, and the time and place of the scheduled public hearing before the mayor and council. Such public hearing shall be conducted with the same formality as that required of public hearings in connection with zoning and rezoning matters before the mayor and council. Upon conclusion of the public hearing, the mayor and council shall be authorized to vote on the application. 
j.  In the event that the application is approved by an appropriate resolution of the mayor and council, the new name of the street shall take effect at such time as is determined by the mayor and council in such resolution. 
k.  Upon adoption of the resolution by the mayor and council, the city clerk shall undertake the following: 
1.  Provide written notice to each property owner owning property abutting the street of the official name of the street as approved by the mayor and council;

(Ord. No. 00-1270, §§ 3.1—3.4, 7-10-00) 
Sec. 22.5-54. - General provisions. 
(a)  Principal or accessory use. A tower and/or antenna is considered a principal use if located on any lot or parcel of land as the sole or primary structure, and is considered an accessory use if located on a lot or parcel shared with a different existing primary use or existing structure. An existing use or structure on the same lot or parcel shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with zoning district requirements, including, but not limited to, set-back, buffer and other requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot or parcel shall control, even though the antenna or tower may be located on a leased area within such lot or parcel. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure. 
(b)  Inventory of existing sites. To facilitate the colocation of antennas, each applicant seeking to locate a new tower, alternative tower structure or antenna, or modify any such existing structure, shall provide to the department an inventory of it's existing towers or alternative tower structures. Applicants seeking to erect an amateur radio tower or antenna shall be exempt from this provision. The inventory shall include all such structures that are within the jurisdiction of the mayor and council or within one-quarter (¼) mile of the city limits, and shall include specific information about the location (latitude and longitude coordinates), height, design, tower type and general suitability for antenna colocation of each tower, and other pertinent information as may be required by the department. The department may share such information with other applicants for a tall structures permit under this chapter or other organizations seeking to locate towers or antennas within the jurisdiction of the mayor and council, provided, however that the department is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
(c)  Colocation; design requirements. In addition to all applicable building and safety codes, all towers, except amateur radio towers, shall be designed to accommodate the colocation of cellular telecommunication antennas according to the following: 
(1)  For towers up to one hundred fifty (150) feet in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least two (2) providers, and 
(2)  For towers greater than one hundred fifty (150) feet in height, the structure and fenced compound shall be designed to accommodate at least three (3) providers. 
(d)  Colocation; availability of suitable existing structures. No new tower, except amateur radio towers, shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the department and mayor and council of the city that no existing tower or existing alternative tower structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. All evidence submitted shall be signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals or qualified industry experts. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the proposed antenna shall consist of one (1) or more of the following: 
(1)  That no existing towers or suitable alternative tower structures are located within the geographic antenna placement area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
(2)  That existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements. 
(3)  That existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's antenna and related equipment. 
(4)  That the applicant's proposed antenna(s) would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna(s) on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
(5)  That the cost or contractual provisions required by the tower owner to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
(6)  That the applicant adequately demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
(e)  Aesthetics. The guidelines set forth in this section shall govern the design and construction of all towers, and the installation of all antennas, governed by this chapter. 
(1)  Towers and/or antennas shall either maintain a galvanized steel or concrete finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
(2)  At all tower sites, the design of all buildings and related structures shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and building environment. 
(3)  For antennas installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical ground equipment shall be of a neutral color so as to make the antenna and related equipment visually unobtrusive. 
(4)  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the mayor and council may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
(5)  No signage or other identifying markings of a commercial nature shall be permitted upon any tower or alternative tower structure within the city. 
(f)  Setbacks and separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers. 
(1)  Towers shall be set back a distance equal to one-third ( 1/3 ) of the height of the tower from its base to any public right-of-way or property line of the lot or parcel containing the tower. 
(2)  Guy-wires and accessory buildings and facilities shall meet the minimum accessory use location and setback requirements. 
(3)  In zoning districts other than NC, CC, GB, DC and P, towers over one hundred fifty (150) feet in height shall not be located closer than one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet from any existing tower that is over one hundred (150) feet in height. This requirement shall not apply to amateur radio towers. 
(g)  Security fencing/anti-climbing devices. All towers and supporting equipment shall be enclosed by fencing not less than six (6) feet in height and shall also be equipped with appropriate anti-climbing devices. Fencing shall be of chain link, wood or other approved alternative. Amateur radio towers and antennas, or receive-only antennas shall not be subject to the provisions of this section unless required by the board of commissioners through the tall structures permit process. 
(h)  Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern landscaping surrounding all towers. 
(1)  Where adequate vegetation is not present, tower facilities shall be landscaped with a landscaped strip of plant materials which effectively screens the view of the tower compound. Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet in width and located outside the fenced perimeter of the compound. Landscaped strips shall satisfy the minimum design and planting requirements for buffers established in the city zoning ordinance. 
(2)  Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be utilized. 
(3)  Amateur radio towers and antennas, or receive-only antennas shall not be subject to the provisions of this section unless required by the mayor and council through the tall structures permit process. 
(i)  Review of tower and antenna erection by airport commission. If upon receipt of an application for the erection of any tower or alternative tower structure governed by this chapter, the department deems that the proposed structure may interfere with the use of the airways of the city by the public or interfere with the operation of existing or proposed airport facilities, a copy of the application shall be submitted by the department to the Fitzgerald-Ben Hill County Airport Commission for review and recommendation. 
(j)  Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this chapter shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and regulations unless a more or less stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Any such removal by the mayor and council shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-7 through 41-2-17. 
(k)  Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee of a tower or alternative tower structure shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the department concludes that a tower fails to comply with all applicable codes and standards, or constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon receipt of written notice by the owner, permittee or lessee of the tower, said party shall have fifteen (15) days to bring the tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner, permittee or lessee fails to bring the tower into compliance within the fifteen (15) days, the mayor and council may remove the tower at the owner, permittee or lessee's expense. Prior to the removal of any tower, the department may consider detailed plans submitted by the owner, permittee or subsequent lessee for repair of substandard towers, and may grant a reasonable extension of the above referenced compliance period. Any such removal by the mayor and council shall be in the manner provided in O.C.G.A. §§ 41-2-7 through 41-2-17. 
(l)  Change of ownership notification. Upon the transfer of ownership of any tower, alternative tower structure, or lot upon which such a structure has been erected, the tower permittee shall notify the department of the transaction in writing within thirty (30) days.

The zoning board of appeals shall dispense with the objection by either: 
(1)  A determination that the application is valid and meets all applicable criteria of this chapter, which shall result in the issuance of a building permit; or 
(2)  A determination that the application does not satisfy all applicable criteria of this chapter. Applications which do not satisfy all applicable criteria must, as a result, be processed through the tall structures permit process set forth in section 22.5-141, contained herein. 
(Ord. No. 00-1270, §§ 5.1—5.5, 7-10-00) 
Sec. 22.5-56. - Administrative approvals. 
(a)  General. 
(1)  The department may administratively approve the placement of additional antennas upon towers or alternative towers structures as set forth in subsection 22.5-101(c). 
(2)  Each applicant requesting an administrative approval under this section shall submit a scaled site plan, scaled elevation view and supporting drawings, calculations, and other documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements, including topography (utilizing minimum two-foot contour intervals), tower height requirements, setbacks, access driveways or easements, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses, and any other information deemed by the department to be necessary to assess compliance with this chapter and compatibility with surrounding uses. Amateur radio antennas shall meet the requirements of the city's applicable construction codes. Certain documentation requirements of this section may be waived by the director for amateur radio antenna applications. 
(3)  The department shall respond to each application within thirty (30) days of its receipt by either approving or denying the application. One (1) thirty-day extension of this review period may be exercised by the department if such additional time is deemed necessary to adequately assess the request. If the department fails to respond to the applicant within a maximum of sixty (60) days, the application shall be deemed to be approved. 
(4)  As part of any administrative approval, the department may administratively reduce setback requirements by up to ten (10) percent to compensate for irregularly shaped lots or parcels. 
(5)  If a request for administrative approval is denied, the applicant may appeal the decision to the Fitzgerald-Ben Hill County Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with procedures for applications for a variance under the City of Fitzgerald Zoning Ordinance. In such an instance, the zoning board of appeals may authorize such variances from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this chapter will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variances may be granted in such individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the zoning board of appeals that the denial of the variance presents a significant detriment to the telecommunications service provider making application, and that the denial of the variance is unsubstantially related to the public welfare. 
(b)  Colocation of antennas required. Applicants for the erection of an antenna, except amateur radio operators, shall be required to colocate upon an existing tower structure. An exception to colocation shall only be made if the applicant adequately demonstrates that an existing tower suitable for colocation does not exist in the geographic antenna placement area utilizing the tower inventory maintained by the department, and that no suitable alternative tower structure is available as set forth in subsection 22.5-61(d) contained herein. 
(c)  Uses allowed by administrative approval. The following uses may be approved by the department after conducting an administrative review: 
(1)  Installation of an antenna on any alternative tower structure, and further including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said antenna, so long as such addition does not add more than twenty (20) feet to the height of the existing structure; 
(2)  Installation of an antenna on an existing tower of any height, including a pre-existing tower, and further including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting equipment used in connection with said antenna, so long as the addition of said antenna adds no more than twenty (20) feet to the height of said existing tower.

(d)  A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building, except where one (1) building stands at the rear of another or an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one (1) building sewer. 
(e)  Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings when they are found, on examination and test by the superintendent, to meet all requirements of this article. 
(f)  The building sewer shall be cast-iron pipe, ASTM specification A74; vitrified clay sewer pipe, ASTM specification C13; or concrete sewer pipe, ASTM specification C14. Joints shall be tight and waterproof. Any part of the building sewer that is located within ten (10) feet of a water service shall be constructed of cast-iron soil pipe with leaded joints. Cast-iron pipe with leaded joints may be required by the superintendent where the building sewer is exposed to damage by tree roots. If installed in filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be cast-iron soil pipe, except that nonmetallic material may be accepted if laid on a suitable concrete bed or cradle as approved by the superintendent. 
(g)  The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the approval of the superintendent, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four (4) inches. The slope of such four-inch pipe shall not be less than one-eighth inch per foot. 
(h)  Whenever possible the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three (3) feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be weakened. The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipes and fittings. 
(i)  In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer. 
(j)  All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the superintendent. Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM specification C12; except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected. 
(k)  All joints and connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Cast-iron pipe joints shall be firmly placed with oakum or hemp and filled with molten lead, federal specification QQL-156, not less than one (1) inch deep. Lead shall be run in one (1) pouring and caulked tight. No paint, varnish or other coating shall be permitted on the joint material until after the joint has been tested and approved. Rubber joint cast-iron pipe may be used as an alternate. 
(l)  All joints in vitrified clay or concrete pipe or between such pipe and metals shall be made with approved hot-pouring jointing material, as specified below or by using rubber gaskets or performed, factory-applied couplings having resilient properties in accordance with ASTM specification C443-59T for concrete pipe and ASTM specification C425-64 for vitrified clay pipe, or the latest revisions thereof. 
(m)  Material for hot-poured joints shall not soften sufficiently to destroy the effectiveness of the joint when subjected to a temperature of one hundred sixty (160) degrees Fahrenheit, not to be soluble in any of the wastes carried by the drainage system. The joint shall first be caulked tight with jute, hemp or similar approved material. 
(n)  Other jointing material and methods may be used only by approval of the superintendent. 
(o)  The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the "Y" branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is twelve (12) inches in diameter or less, and no properly located "Y" branch is available, the city shall install a "Y" branch in the public sewer at the location specified by the superintendent. Where the public sewer is greater than twelve (12) inches in diameter, and no properly located "Y" branch is available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer to receive the building sewer, which entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about forty-five (45) degrees. A forty-five-degree ell may be used to make such connection, with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at the same or at a higher elevation than the invert of the public sewer. A smooth neat joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by the superintendent. 
(p)  The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the superintendent when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. 
(q)  All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the water, light and bond commission. 
(r)  Any industry or establishment producing industrial wastes shall comply with the United States Environmental Protection Agency Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 128) prior to connection with the system. 
(s)  Effluent limitations promulgated by the federal act shall apply in any instance where they are more stringent than those in this article. Under section 307(b) of the act, federal pretreatment standards are designed to achieve two (2) purposes: 
(1)  To protect the operation of publicly owned treatment works; 
(2)  To prevent the discharge of pollutants which pass through such works inadequately treated. 
(t)  Users in industrial categories subject to effluent guidelines issued under section 304(b) of the act, which are discharging incompatible pollutants to publicly owned treatment works, are required to adopt best practicable control technology currently available, as defined by the administrator pursuant to section 304(b) of the act. 
(u)  Where the treatment works was designed to and does achieve substantial removal of pollutants, suspended solids, pH and fecal coliform bacteria, it is not appropriate to require the industrial user to achieve best practical control technology currently available, since this would lead to an uneconomical duplication of treatment facilities. While the term "substantial removal" is not subject to precise definition, it generally contemplates removals in the order of eighty (80) percent or greater. Minor incidental removals in the order of ten (10) to thirty (30) percent are not considered "substantial." For some industrial categories it may be necessary to define pretreatment guidelines for problems that may arise as a result of the discharge into publicly owned treatment works. However, any adjustments required for particular industrial categories should be considered in connection with the city's requirements rather than in the national pretreatment standard. Limitations on wastewater strength may be supplemented with more stringent limitations if the city determines that the limitations set in this article may not be sufficient to protect the operation of the city's treatment works, or if the city determines that the limitations in this article may not be sufficient to enable the city's treatment works to comply with water quality standards or effluent limitations specified in the city's national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit.

(Ord. No. 99-1259-1, § 8, 10-11-99) 
Sec. 24-59. - Quantity of trees. 
(a)  The minimum required quantity of trees on a site after development must produce a total SDF of twenty-five (25) units per acre. The SDF is determined as follows: 
SDF = (total site area, in acres) × 25. 
(b)  The number of new trees to be planted on a site after development is determined as follows: 
(1)  Using Table 1, calculate the existing density factor (EDF) of trees ten (10) inches DBH or greater which will remain on the site and be protected during construction. Existing trees of at least two (2) inches DBH, but less than ten (10) inches DBH, which will remain on the site and be protected during construction, may be counted as 0.5 unit each provided such trees have grown in uncrowded conditions and have developed normal spread. Add together the individual units for each tree to get the EDF. 
Table 1 - Conversion from DBH to EDF: 

 
(2)  To calculate the replacement density factor (RDF), subtract the EDF from the SDF. 
Table 2 - Conversion from DBH or Caliper to RDF: 

 
(c)  Application of density factors to the plan: 
(1)  No tree shall be planted closer to a building foundation or water, sewer, electrical or natural gas line, than as follows: 
a.  Five (5) feet for a mature small tree. 
b.  Ten (10) feet for a mature medium tree. 
c.  Fifteen (15) feet for a mature large tree. 
(2)  No tree shall be planted under overhead utility distribution lines if the average mature height of the tree is greater than the lowest overhead wire.

a.  The total area of such islands shall comprise at least five (5) percent of the parking lot area in commercial and residential zoning districts or three (3) percent of the parking lot area in industrial zoning districts; plus one (1) percent of other vehicle use area on the property such as loading, storage or display areas. 
b.  Each island shall contain a minimum of fifty (50) square feet. It shall be so shaped that a five-foot diameter circle will fit within the island. No portion of an island less than three (3) feet in width may be counted in the area. 
c.  Landscape islands shall be located in such a manner as to divide and break up the expanse of paving. 
d.  Vehicles may overhang a landscape island provided said island is at least three and one-half (3.5) feet in depth per abutting parking space, at least five (5) feet in depth overall (except in cases where one (1) or more large trees are present on the island in which case the island must be at least ten (10) feet in depth overall), and protected by wheel stops or curbing. Two (2) feet of said landscaped area may count as part of the required depth of each abutting parking space. 
(d)  At least one (1) shade tree shall be planted in each required landscape island, and at least one (1) tree shall be planted for every thirty (30) linear feet of length in the side and rear setback areas required by the city's zoning ordinance. 
(e)  Where trees must be added to achieve the SDF, such additions shall be made between the street and the front of the building until such additions together with the existing trees comprise one-half (½) of the SDF. 
(f)  Existing trees which are in excess of the minimum SDF requirement but are outside the development area shall not be removed unless adjacent development would cause irreparable damage to the critical root area. 
(Ord. No. 99-1259-1, § 9, 10-11-99)

The criteria for replacement trees in sites under development shall be as follows: 
(a)  Spacing and the potential size of species chosen shall be compatible with spatial limitations of the site on which they are to be planted. 
(b)  The species must be ecologically compatible with the specifically intended growing site. 
(c)  Replacement trees must have the potential for size and quality comparable to the removed trees. 
(d)  Preference shall be given to specimens of no more than three (3) inches DBH. 
(e)  Where the proposed development area is so large that the minimum SDF cannot be achieved, the development area shall be reduced by removing parking spaces in excess of the minimum required, additional planting islands shall be placed within the development area, and/or the area to be occupied by buildings shall be reduced until the minimum SDF is achieved. 
(Ord. No. 99-1259-1, § 10, 10-11-99)

(c)  No construction within a tree's dripline will be allowed, unless protective measures to insure the survival of the tree or trees are detailed in the tree protection plan and approved by the building inspector. 
(d)  All tree protection devices shall be installed prior to any clearing, grubbing or grading, and must remain in functional condition throughout all phases of the development. Such devices must be inspected and approved by the building inspector before the issuance of a land disturbance permit. 
(e)  Felling trees into tree protection zones or disturbance of the critical root zone is not permitted. 
(f)  No erosion or sedimentation control measures may be installed in a manner so as to result in the accumulation of sediment within a tree protection zone. 
(g)  All boring under the tree protection zone shall be done at a depth of at least thirty-six (36) inches O.C. and must begin and end outside the tree protection zone. 
(h)  Trenching outside a tree protection zone shall follow these specifications: 
(i)  Crushed or torn roots shall be cleaved back to good wood and a sharp clean cut shall be made to promote regrowth. 
(ii)  Work in the area and foot traffic shall be confined to the side of the trench away from the tree.

a.  Council may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of provisions of this ordinance will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of this ordinance shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Provided, however, that a variance shall not be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this ordinance in the district in question. A variance may be granted in an individual case upon finding by the council that all of the following exists: 
1.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography; and 
2.  The application of this ordinance to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; and 
3.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved, or, in the alternative, that such conditions are due to the location of existing utilities; and 
4.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this ordinance; provided that no variance may be granted for a use of land, building or structure that is prohibited by this ordinance . 
b.  Council in granting a variance may impose or require such additional restrictions and standards (i.e., increased setbacks, buffer strips, screening, etc.) as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of residents and workers in the community, and to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood. 
c.  Whenever council shall find, in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance that any of the terms, conditions or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not being complied with, council shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity.
