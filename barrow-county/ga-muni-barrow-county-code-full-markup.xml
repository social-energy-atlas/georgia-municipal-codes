PREFACE

        </div>
         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of Barrow County, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2000 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1993 Code, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Lawton Langford, president, and Lisa V. Dixon, supplement editor of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Michelle R. Sims, County Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance and other members of Barrow County's staff during the progress of the work on this publication.

                  Section 3. The repeal provided for in Section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
                  Section 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof, shall be punished by a fine not to exceed the maximum fine allowed by state law for a violation of a county ordinance or be imprisonment not to exceeed 60 days or both such fine and imprisonment. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the County may pursue other remedies, such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief, and revocation of licenses or permits. 
                  Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code, when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the County to make the same a part of the Code, shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments. 
                  Section 6. Ordinances adopted after January 25, 2000, that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code, shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code.

                  Sec. 2-769. - Complaints. 
                  The board of ethics shall be responsible for hearing and deciding any complaints filed regarding alleged violations of this article by any person. The following procedures shall be followed when filing a complaint: 
                  (1)  Any person may file a complaint alleging a violation of any of the provisions of this article by submitting it to the chief of operations (or his/her equivalent), who shall immediately deliver such complaint to the chairman of the board of ethics or his or her designee. A copy of such complaint shall immediately be forwarded by registered mail to the county official or employee against whom the complaint was filed. The complaint must be supported by affidavits based on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. All documents referred to in an affidavit(s) should be attached to the affidavit(s). The person filing the complaint shall verify the complaint by his or her signature thereon. A complaint must be filed within six months of the date the alleged violation is said to have occurred, or in case of concealment or nondisclosure within six months of the date the alleged violation should have been discovered after due diligence. In the event the board of ethics makes an initial determination that a complaint is technically deficient, the board of ethics shall submit a list of deficiencies to the complainant and offer the complainant the opportunity to correct the deficiencies within seven days prior to the complaint being dismissed for technical deficiencies. 
                  (2)  Upon receipt of a complaint alleging misconduct, the county official or employee against whom the complaint was filed may reply to the complaint within 30 days, unless such time for reply is extended by the board of ethics upon good cause shown. The response of the county official or employee must be supported by affidavits based on personal knowledge, must set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and must show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. All documents referred to in an affidavit(s) should be attached to the affidavit(s). 
                  (3)  Within 60 days of receipt of a complaint, the board of ethics shall conduct an investigatory review to determine whether specific substantiated evidence from a credible source(s) exists to support a reasonable belief that there has been a violation of this article. If after reviewing the complaint the board of ethics by vote determines that no specific, substantiated evidence from a credible source(s) exists to support a reasonable belief that there has been a violation of this article or determines that no violation occurred, it may dismiss the complaint without further proceedings. In the event a complaint is dismissed based upon the merits of the complaint, the complaint may not be re-filed. 
                  (4)  If the board of ethics determines that specific, substantiated evidence from a credible source(s) exists to support a reasonable belief that there has been a violation of this article, certified written notice of a hearing, containing the time, date and place of such hearing, shall be given to each party by the board of ethics, and a formal public hearing shall be conducted and both parties afforded an opportunity to be heard. Any formal public hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of due process. The board of ethics is authorized to swear witnesses. 
                  (5)  Any final determination resulting from the hearing shall include written findings of fact and conclusions of law. The board of ethics shall determine if clear and convincing evidence shows any violation of this article. 
                  (6)  Nothing in this section shall be considered to limit or encumber the right of the board of ethics to initiate an investigation on its own cognizance as it deems necessary to fulfill its obligations under this article. 
                  (Ord. of 6-13-2004, Art. 5, § 14) 
                  Sec. 2-770. - Disciplinary action. 
                  (a)  Upon a determination that an employee has violated this article, the board of ethics may recommend the following penalties and actions: 
                  (1)  Written warning or reprimand; 
                  (2)  Suspension without pay; 
                  (3)  Termination of employment; and 
                  (4)  Repayment to the county of any unjust enrichment. 
                  (b)  Upon a determination that a county official has violated this article, the board of ethics may recommend the following penalties and actions:

                  (2)  Removal from office to the extent provided by Georgia law; and 
                  (3)  Repayment to the county of any unjust enrichment. 
                  (c)  Upon direction of the board of ethics, a petition may be filed for injunctive relief, or any other appropriate relief, in the county superior court, or in any other court having proper venue and jurisdiction, for the purpose of requiring compliance with the provisions of this article. In addition, the court may issue an order to cease and desist from the violation of the ordinance. The court also may void an official action that is the subject of the violation, provided that the legal action to void the matter was brought with 90 days of the occurrence of the official action, if the court deems voiding the action to be in the best interest of the public. The court, after hearing and considering all the circumstances in the case, may grant all or part of the relief sought. However, the court may not void any official action appropriating public funds, levying taxes or providing for the issuance of bonds, notes or other evidences of public obligation under this article. 
                  (d)  In addition to any other remedy provided herein, upon determination of a violation of this article, the board of ethics may recommend to the board of commissioners in writing that any contract, bid, or change order that was the subject of the violation should be cancelled or rescinded. The board of commissioners, however, shall retain the discretion to determine whether such a cancellation or rescission would be in the best interest of the county and shall not be bound in any way by a recommendation of the board of ethics. 
                  (e)  The ethics board may also forward its findings of fact and conclusions of law to the Barrow County District Attorney's Office and/or the office of the governor for appropriate action. 
                  (Ord. of 6-13-2004, Art. 5, § 15) 
                  Sec. 2-771. - Judicial review. 
                  (a)  Any party against whom a decision of the board of ethics is rendered may obtain judicial review of the decision by writ of certiorari to the superior court of the county. The application for the writ must be filed within 30 days from the date of the written decision. Judicial review shall be based upon the record. No party shall be entitled to a de novo appeal. 
                  (b)  Upon failure to timely request judicial review of the decision by writ of certiorari as provided in this section, the decision shall be binding and final upon all parties. 
                  (c)  The appellate rights afforded hereunder shall be in lieu of any right to appeal an adverse employment action under the Barrow County Civil Service System, to the extent the county official or employee may be subject to the civil service system.

                  (b)  Denial. If the application for a permit and the accompanying contract documents describing the work do not conform to the requirements or the technical codes or other pertinent laws or ordinances, the building official shall not issue a permit, but shall return the contract documents to the applicant with his refusal to issue such permit.

The county marshal shall have the authority to enter upon premises to conduct an inspection. If such an inspection is necessary, the county marshal shall endeavor to obtain the permission of the owner to conduct such inspection. If permission is withheld, the county marshal may seek the assistance of the county attorney's office to obtain an inspection warrant from the magistrate court. The county marshal may determine that the dwelling, building, structure or property is being used in the commission of drug crimes after consultation with the county sheriff's department. 
                  (b)  Judicial complaint and summons. If the county marshal's investigation or inspection confirms that any dwelling, building, structure or property meets one or more of the three enumerated standards from subsection (a), the county marshal may file in the magistrate court a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property wherein the nuisance complained of exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the parties in interest of such dwelling, building, or structure pursuant to the provisions of section 22-152.

                  (1)  If the repair of the said dwelling, building, structure or property can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to its present value, the order shall require the owner, within a reasonable specified time, to repair such dwelling, building, structure or property so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to effect a closing of any structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair of the said dwelling, building, structure or property in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value thereof, the order shall require the owner, within a specified time, to demolish and remove the subject dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the dwelling, building, structure or property. 
                  For purposes of cases arising under this ordinance, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be [a] factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by either affidavits or testimony of real estate appraisers with a [State of] Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A., Tit. 43, Ch. 39A, qualified building contractors with a current business license to do work in the county, or qualified building inspectors. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations. 
                  (g)  Remedies of public officer in the event of noncompliance with order. The order shall further provide that, if the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, demolish, or close the dwelling, building, structure or property within the specified time, the county marshal may cause such dwelling, building, structure or property to be repaired, demolished, or closed, whichever the order required. The county marshal is also authorized to file a motion for attachment for contempt against the owner with the magistrate court as an alternate or additional remedy. 
                  If the county marshal chooses to have the work done as ordered on any dwelling building or structure, he or she shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a notice stating: 
                  By order of the county marshal, the use and occupation of this building is prohibited because it is (a) unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use because it does not comply with the county code; or (b) has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes; or (c) constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions.

                  If the county marshal has a structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. Any salvaged materials sold by the county marshal shall not be warranted in any manner. 
                  (Ord. of 8-28-01, § 8) 
                  Sec. 22-149. - Lien for costs of abatement. 
                  (a)  Filing of lien for costs of abatement. A lien for the full amount of the costs of nuisance abatement shall be a filed against the subject real property. Such costs shall include, but not be limited to, the cost of demolition, reasonable attorneys' fees, all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, restoration to grade of the real property should it be demolished, and title examination costs. The county marshal shall prepare a "lien for costs of abatement" detailing any and all such costs, and attach thereto a certified copy of the order requiring nuisance abatement for the subject dwelling, building, structure or property. The clerk of the superior court shall duly record the certified copy of the order of nuisance abatement in the deed records of Barrow County and enter the lien for costs of abatement on the general execution docket. The lien shall attach to the property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of the superior court of the county, and the lien shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice as required by subsection 22-147(c). The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the dwelling, building, structure or property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid in full. The county marshal also shall forward a copy of the order of nuisance abatement and a copy of the lien for costs of abatement to the county tax commissioner. 
                  (b)  Enforcement of lien. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien for costs of abatement. The tax commissioner shall be authorized to bill the amount of the lien separately or in conjunction with the annual ad valorem tax bill for the subject property. The tax commissioner shall have the full authority to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. Tit. 48, Ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of code section 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The Barrow County Tax Commissioner shall remit any monies collected from liens for costs for abatement to the general fund of Barrow County. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  (c)  Waiver and release of liens. The board of commissioners may waive and release any such lien imposed on dwelling, building, structure or property upon the owner of such dwelling, building, structure or property entering into a contract with the county agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the dwelling, building, structure or property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.

                  Sec. 22-150. - Appellate procedure. 
                  If the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, appellate review of the magistrate court's order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, structure or property shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

                  Sec. 26-141. - Granting of franchises. 
                  (a)  Filing of application. Each applicant, whether a natural or corporate person, seeking a franchise to operate a cable television system in the unincorporated areas of the county shall file a written application with the board of commissioners at its offices in the county courthouse in Winder. The board of commissioners may promulgate the forms to be used in making these applications. 
                  (b)  Contents of application. The written forms shall require the applicant to state: 
                  (1)  The applicant's name. 
                  (2)  Whether the applicant is a natural person, partnership, corporation, limited partnership or other form of business entity. 
                  (3)  The applicant's business address. 
                  (4)  The applicant's trade names and where such trade names are registered. 
                  (5)  Where the articles of incorporation or of limited partnership are filed. 
                  (6)  If a corporation, under the laws of which state or nation so incorporated. 
                  (7)  The number of shareholders. 
                  (8)  The names, addresses and telephone numbers of the corporate officers. 
                  (9)  The minimum stated capital of the corporation. 
                  (10)  The current capitalization of the corporation. 
                  (11)  The areas or places where it currently operates. 
                  (12)  The type of service the applicant proposes to sell and operate within the county. 
                  (c)  Compliance with state and federal regulations. All applicants shall certify under oath that they have fully complied with all state or federal rules and regulations applying to their operation of a cable television system. All applicants shall have a continuing obligation to comply with such rules and regulations. 
                  (d)  Hearing. Upon receipt of the application, the board of commissioners shall cause to be mailed to the applicant and to each other applicant for a franchise to operate a cable television system and to cable television franchisees a notice of the time when and place where the board of commissioners shall conduct a public hearing to discuss and act upon the pending application. All applicants and franchisees shall be permitted to address the board of commissioners at the meeting. 
                  (e)  Required information; qualifications of applicant. The board of commissioners may require each applicant to give all information and provide any documentation necessary to establish that the applicant acts in good faith in making the application. No franchise shall be granted to any person unless such person shall demonstrate to the board of commissioners that the person is solvent and capable of performing and discharging the terms of the franchise. 
                  (f)  Fees and franchise taxes. The board of commissioners may enact such fees and charges, and impose such franchise taxes, as from time to time it deems advisable and as permitted by law. 
                  (g)  Issuance. Because the county derives a benefit from the collection of fees, charges and taxes by virtue of franchising cable television systems, as well as protecting its residents from inadequate performance by cable television franchisees, the board of commissioners, in issuing franchises, may take into account the number of existing franchisees versus the size of the market in the county, the quality of the service the applicant proposes to sell, and the ability of the applicant to perform and discharge its obligations to those subscribing to its services and to the county under the terms of the franchise granted it. 
                  (h)  Revocation and other sanctions. Should any franchisee breach its obligations as defined in its franchise so that the board of commissioners has probable cause to revoke its franchise or otherwise apply sanctions against the franchisee, the board of commissioners shall mail notice of the time and place for hearing this matter to the franchisee alleged to have breached its legal obligations. The franchisee shall have the opportunity to be heard at the time and place appointed and to be represented by counsel. Nothing in this subsection may be construed to deprive either the board of commissioners or any franchisee of pursuing other legal or administrative remedies available to it. 
                  (i)  Notices. All notices shall be mailed not later than the eighth day before the time set for hearings. Applicants may waive this notice provision. 
                  (j)  Interpretation of section. The purpose of this section is to establish a means of processing applications for franchises, and this section is not intended to create any substantive right in prospective applicants. The board of commissioners, in granting franchises, may frame the terms and conditions of such franchises as in its sole discretion it deems best suited to promote the public interest.

                  Sec. 26-142. - Overbuilding of systems prohibited. 
                  The board of commissioners prohibits the overbuilding of cable systems within the unincorporated area of the county. The clerk is directed to send a copy of this section to each cable franchisee and to each public utility that has poles erected along county rights-of-way.

The existence of overcharging shall be presumed from a substantial increase in the price at which the merchandise or cost/rental of housing was offered in the usual course of business immediately prior to the onset of the emergency, but shall not include increases in cost to the supplier directly attributable to the higher cost of material, supplies and labor costs resulting from the emergency. 
                  State of emergency: Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 38-3-3(5), the term is defined as a condition declared by the governor when, in his judgment, the threat or actual occurrence of a disaster or emergency is of sufficient severity and magnitude as to warrant extraordinary efforts in preventing or alleviating the damage, loss, hardship or suffering threatened or caused thereby.

In order to preserve, protect or sustain the life, health or safety of persons or their property within the declared disaster area, it shall be unlawful, during the duration of the state or emergency or subsequent recovery period in which the county has been designated as a disaster area, for any person located or doing business in the county to overcharge for any goods, materials, services, motel rooms, temporary lodging or houses sold or rented within the county. 
                  (c)  Penalty. Violations of the provisions of this section, upon conviction, shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation or imprisonment not to exceed 60 days, or both such fine and imprisonment. Each sale or rental shall constitute a separate offense.

                  The storage and processing of wood chips, hogged material, fines, compost, mulch and raw products in association with yard waste and recycling facilities located within Barrow County shall be in accordance with Georgia law, the Barrow County Code of Ordinances, and the International Fire Code (as adopted by the State of Georgia). 
                  (Ord. of 3-28-2017, § 1) 
                  Sec. 42-42. - Purpose. 
                  (a)  This standard shall provide guidelines for raw wood waste processors and recyclers and their operations. Wood chipping, hogging, composting and mulching operations and storage create a significant fire hazard and are rated as a very high hazard based on the 'Heat of Output' Btu per pound of product. 
                  (b)  While generally more difficult to ignite than usual Class A combustibles such as paper and cardboard, after being ignited the spread of fire and smoke can be rapid and deep-seated. The larger the storage of raw wood products, the greater the fire hazard and the more difficult a fire is to control. Wood waste processors and recyclers and their operations shall comply with this standard. 
                  (Ord. of 3-28-2017, § 1)

                  ARTICLE II. - DISPOSSESSORIES 

                  Sec. 70-31. - The intent of the article. 
                  It is the intent of this article to promote, protect, and improve the health, safety, and welfare of the traveling public in the county by providing the means by which personalty of dispossessed tenants will be removed from the county's right-of-way if otherwise left thereon for a period in excess of 24 hours. 
                  (Ord. of 8-14-2001(2), § 1) 
                  Sec. 70-32. - Dispossessory bond required. 
                  Upon the receipt of a writ of possession issued by the court for execution, the sheriff or his/her designee shall inquire of the property owner, landlord, or his agent, if, in addition to placing the property owner or landlord in possession of the premises, the property owner or landlord desires the personalty of the tenant removed to the county's right-of-way. If the answer is affirmative, the sheriff shall inform the property owner or landlord that he/she is required to post a cash bond with county sheriff's office in the amount of $500.00.

                  Sec. 70-33. - Property deemed to be abandoned. 
                  Property which has been set on the right-of-way of the county and remains there for a period in excess of 24 hours shall be presumed abandoned unless prior arrangements for claiming the property by the owner, his/her heirs or assigns has been received by the county sheriff's office. Such abandoned property shall be deemed a hazard and detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the traveling public in the county.

                  Sec. 70-34. - Disposition of abandoned property. 
                  (a)  Whenever it is brought to the attention of the county that abandoned property, within the meaning of the preceding section exists on the right-of-way, the sheriff's office shall attempt to ascertain the name, address, and telephone number of the owner of the property. If such information is known, the owner of the property shall be contacted and advised to immediately abate the hazard by removing the property from the right-of-way. 
                  (b)  In the event the personalty of a dispossessed tenant is set on the county's right-of-way at the insistence of the property owner or landlord, and such property thereafter is presumed abandoned, the property owner or landlord at his or her own expense shall cause the personalty to be removed from the county's right-of-way. 
                  (c)  If the owner of the abandoned property cannot be located and contacted, and if the property owner or landlord fails to remove the abandoned property, the county may abate the hazard without the prior approval of the property owner. The county is authorized to use county work crews, private contractors, or any inmate labor within the county to abate the hazard by removing the abandoned property to the county landfill.

                  Sec. 70-35. - Claim against dispossessory bond. 
                  In the event the personalty of a dispossessed tenant remains on the county's right-of-way for a period in excess of 24 hours, and is therefore deemed abandoned by the owner, the property owner or landlord at his own expense shall cause the personalty to be removed from the county's right-of-way. In the event the property owner or landlord fails to remove the personalty within the time prescribed, the county may cause such personalty to be removed to the county landfill, and thereafter assert a claim against the dispossessory bond posted by the property owner or landlord to cover the expenses of removal and disposal of the abandoned property. In the further event the property owner or landlord has not posted a bond as required by this article, or that bond is not sufficient to cover the expenses of removing and disposing of the abandoned property, and such expenses have not been paid in full to the county 30 days after the property has been removed, a lien may be placed against the realty from which the abandoned property was removed, and thereafter foreclosed in the same manner as special liens on real estate by laborers in accordance with applicable [State of] Georgia laws.

Nothing contained in this section shall abrogate the right of the tenant to remove their personalty from the county's right-of-way, nor of the property owner or landlord to remove such personalty and thereafter proceed against the tenants for the recovery of expenses incurred.

At the time the debt is issued, the chief financial officer shall determine if he or she reasonably expects that one of the arbitrage rebate exceptions will be satisfied. If the arbitrage rebate exception relates to the time period over which the proceeds of the debt are spent, the chief financial officer shall verify that the appropriate expenditures have been made at each milestone. If one of the milestones is not satisfied or the chief financial officer does not reasonably expect that one of the arbitrage rebate exceptions will be satisfied, an outside arbitrage rebate consultant shall be retained.

                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 103)

                  The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to these regulations and the comprehensive plan and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets.

                  (a)  Nonconformities in general. 
                  (1)  This section sets out the provisions that protect uses, structures, lots and signs that lawfully existed prior to the adoption of this Development Code or a subsequent amendment, but no longer conform to the new regulations. The primary intent of the treatment of nonconformity is to allow continuation of these uses, structures, lots and signs until the end of their useful life, while encouraging conformance to the new regulations when it becomes reasonable. 
                  (2)  Nothing in this Development Code shall prevent the strengthening, repair or restoration to a safe or lawful condition of any part of any building or structure declared unsafe or unlawful by the director of licensing and permits, the fire chief or any other duly authorized county official. 
                  (3)  The lawful use of any nonconforming uses, structures, lots and signs may be continued, even though such use does not conform to the provisions of this Development Code under the circumstances presented in this section for each type of development. 
                  (b)  Nonconforming uses. 
                  (1)  Nonconforming uses; defined. A nonconforming use is a use or activity that was lawfully established prior to the adoption, revision or amendment of this Development Code, but which, by reason of such adoption, revision or amendment, is no longer a use or activity permitted by right or no longer meets or conforms to the requirements of this Development Code. 
                  (2)  Grandfathered nonconforming uses. To avoid undue hardship, the lawful but nonconforming use of any structure or land at the time of the enactment of this Development Code or any subsequent amendment may be continued even though the use does not conform to the provisions of this Development Code, except that the nonconforming use: 
                  a.  Shall not be changed to another nonconforming use. 
                  b.  Shall not be re-established after its removal from the property for more than 15 days in the case of a nonconforming manufactured home, or its discontinuance for six months or more for all other uses, unless the premises are under a continuing lease but are unoccupied by the nonconforming use, regardless of the intent of the owner or occupier to resume the nonconforming use. 
                  c.  Shall not be extended to occupy a greater area of land. 
                  d.  Shall not be extended to occupy a greater area of a building or structure unless such additional area of the building or structure existed at the time of the passage or amendment of this Development Code and was clearly designed to house the same use as the nonconforming use occupying the other portion of the building or structure. 
                  e.  If an existing use was lawfully established in a zoning district that is subsequently amended to require special use approval for such use, the existing use shall not be subject to the provisions of this subsection. 
                  f.  Any intended but not yet existing nonconforming use for which a vested right was acquired prior to the adoption of this Development Code or the adoption of an amendment to it shall be prohibited unless such intended nonconforming use for which a vested right was acquired is actually commenced within one year of the adoption of this Development Code or the adoption of an amendment to it regardless of the intent or expectation to commence or abandon such nonconforming use. 
                  (c)  Nonconforming structures. 
                  (1)  Nonconforming structures; defined. A nonconforming structure is a structure or building whose size, dimensions or location on a property were lawful prior to the adoption, revision or amendment of this Development Code, but which, by reason of such adoption, revision or amendment, no longer meets or conforms to one or more such requirements of this Development Code. 
                  (2)  Grandfathered nonconforming structures. A nonconforming structure may continue to be occupied and used, except that the nonconforming structure: 
                  a.  Shall not be repaired, rebuilt or altered after damage exceeds 60 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction except in conformance with this Development Code. Nonconforming structures that are damaged 60 percent or less must begin reconstruction or repair within six months after the damage is incurred in order to maintain the structure's grandfathered status. 
                  b.  Shall not be enlarged or altered in any way that increases its nonconformity, but it may be repaired to the extent necessary to maintain it in a safe and sanitary condition, exceeding one-third of its value.

                  d.  Shall not be occupied by a use for which off-street parking requirements cannot be met.

                  Sec. 89-67. - Zoning districts; purpose of each. 
                  (a)  Agricultural district (AG). The AG agricultural district is composed chiefly of open land, small agricultural uses and individual single-family houses. The regulations for this district are designed to encourage compatibility between existing agricultural uses and the development of limited low-density residential development while maintaining the rural character of the district. This district is characterized by large acreage residential lots and farms of at least five acres. Institutional uses (such as churches) that are compatible with the rural environment and compatible commercial farm uses, such as commercial greenhouses and riding stables are allowed. 
                  (b)  Agricultural-residential district (AR) . The AR agricultural-residential district is established to provide a transition between agricultural uses and residential uses. This district provides a location for light agriculture, single-family residential, residentially compatible institutional and recreational uses, and selected agricultural related commercial, such as produce stands, within a rural setting. When residentially compatible institutional, recreational and commercial uses are developed within the AR district, they are to be designed and built to ensure density compatibility with adjacent single-family detached dwellings and otherwise to implement the stated purpose and intent of this Development Code. Minimum lot size within the district is two acres. 
                  (c)  Low density single-family residential district (R-1). The R-1 low density single-family residential district is established to provide locations for single-family detached residential uses on individual lots, conventional subdivisions, master planned developments, and residentially compatible institutional and recreational uses. When residentially compatible institutional and recreational uses are developed within the R-1 district, they are to be designed and built to ensure density compatibility with adjacent single-family detached dwellings and otherwise to implement the stated purpose and intent of this Development Code. 
                  (d)  Medium density residential district (R-2). The R-2 medium density residential district is established to provide locations for smaller lot single-family, fee simple duplexes, fee simple townhouses (single-family attached) and residentially compatible institutional and recreational uses. When residentially compatible institutional and recreational uses are developed within the R-2 district, they are to be designed and built to ensure density compatibility with adjacent residential dwellings and otherwise to implement the stated purpose and in Code. 
                  (e)  High density residential district (R-3). The R-3 high density residential district is established to provide locations for a mix of housing types, including single-family detached residential, attached single-family residential uses, duplexes, triplexes, quadraplexes and townhouses, and condominiums. The intention of this district is to incorporate multi-family residential within small complexes that will not create a large impact on services within the community. When residentially compatible institutional and recreational uses are developed within the medium density residential district, they are to be designed and built to ensure density compatibility with adjacent residences and otherwise to implement the stated purpose and intent of this Development Code. 
                  (f)  Manufactured housing district (MH). The MH manufactured housing district is established to provide locations for manufactured home subdivisions and manufactured home parks, in addition to single-family, two-family or multi-family residential developments. When residentially compatible institutional and recreational uses are developed within the manufactured housing district, they are to be designed and built to ensure density compatibility with adjacent residences and otherwise to implement the stated purpose and intent of this Development Code. This district also allows small commercial uses and commercial accessory uses within developments.

                  Properties previously zoned AC may continue to be used or developed under their zoning approval, but no new AC zoning requests will be approved under this Development Code. 
                  (h)  Office and institutional (O-I). The O-I office and institutional district is established to provide locations for business service, administrative and professional offices; semi-public and nonprofit institutions such as private schools, churches and other places of worship, and medical centers; and limited commercial activities generally not involving personal services or retail sales, or the storage or processing of merchandise. 
                  (i)  Neighborhood commercial district (C-1). The C-1 neighborhood commercial district is established to provide locations for individual businesses that reflect a neighborhood level of intensity and serve a small geographic area, that are compatible with the surrounding residential neighborhoods, and that are not traffic intense. Uses are to consist primarily of convenience shopping facilities, small offices and services that serve a neighborhood oriented market and which supply necessities and/or services that usually require frequent purchasing with a minimum of consumer travel. When located within a master planned development, the NC district should provide for uses that are lower intensity in nature, or design features implemented in order to ensure compatibility with adjacent dwellings. 
                  (j)  Community commercial district (C-2). The C-2 community commercial district is established to provide locations for office, commercial and service uses that serve several neighborhoods or a portion of the county. Uses within this district are more impact-intensive than neighborhood commercial uses, and should be located at the perimeter of residential areas and along major thoroughfares. The CRC district is intended to accommodate a range of commercial, retail, service and office uses, from a more community serving level including: medical office developments, banking and financial institutions, professional offices, community retail and services, and shopping centers anchored by grocery or drug stores. 
                  (k)  Intensive commercial district (C-3). Within the C-3 intensive commercial district, land uses are oriented to those, which are designated to serve the automotive traveling public. This district provides locations for retail commercial, storage, limited light industrial uses and service uses that are land intensive and have a need for major road access and visibility. The district is intended to serve the automobile, its passengers and highway users rather than individuals who use an automobile as convenience to perform necessary daily and weekly personal needs. The district is intended to be restricted to major arterials and collectors which may also have other businesses located on them. Major planned shopping centers, specialty shopping centers, big box commercial centers and villages incorporating shared access, parking and design are encouraged. 
                  (l)  Light industrial district (M-1). The M-1 light industrial district is established to provide locations for office, churches and other places of worship, business park, light manufacturing and distribution/service facilities developed as planned industrial developments that are located on or have ready access to a major collector or arterial street. Light manufacturing facilities shall not involve heavy manufacturing or the conversion of raw materials into finished products. Light manufacturing uses shall generally consist of establishments for processing, assembling, fabricating, preparing, cleaning, servicing, testing, or repairing of materials, goods or products. Such uses should be encouraged near existing like uses, in accordance with policies outlined in the Barrow County Comprehensive Land Use Plan. 
                  (m)  Heavy industrial district (M-2). The M-2 heavy industrial district is established to provide locations for churches and other places of worship, intensive industrial uses such as automobile repair and service, heavy manufacturing, uses involving chemicals, warehousing and storage, and other industrial uses that are not public nuisances and are not dangerous to the health, safety or general welfare of the inhabitants of Barrow County. Sites within this district shall have direct access from an arterial or major collector road. When located at the perimeter of a future land use map industrial category, the M-2 district should provide for uses that are lower in intensity and scale to ensure minimal impact to adjacent properties. 
                  (n)  Airport hazard overlay district (AHO). an overlay district superimposed on those other zoning districts that are within the flight approach zones of airports in the county. The regulations of this district are intended to establish height restrictions within the flight approach zones.

                  Sec. 89-68. - Uses allowed in each zoning district. 
                  (a)  Allowed principal and accessory uses. 
                  (1)  Principal use: The specific, primary purpose for which land or a building is used. 
                  (2)  Accessory use: A use that is permitted on a property in conjunction with a principal use. An accessory use is incidental to the principal use and would generally not exist independent of the principal use. 
                  (3)  Principal uses that are allowed by right or allowed only by special use approval in each zoning district are shown on the following Table 2.3. Accessory uses that are allowed in conjunction with a principal use are shown on Table 2.1. 
                  (b)  Restrictions on particular uses. 
                  (1)  Requirements that apply to specific uses are listed in the Article III of this Development Code. For convenience, those uses are identified by a separate symbol on the following Table 2.3 and Table 2.4 for uses that would otherwise be allowed by right. The restrictions also apply to special uses unless specifically waived or modified as a stipulation of special use approval. For those uses that have specific restrictions associated with them, a reference is given on the two tables to the pertinent section in Article III. 
                  (2)  The following sections of Article III apply to all or a variety of individual uses, however, and are not generally indicated on either of the two tables: 
                  a.  Section 89-122, Agricultural separation requirements. 
                  b.  Section 89-123, Environmentally hazardous uses. 
                  c.  Section 89-124, Outdoor display areas. 
                  d.  Section 89-125, Outdoor storage. 
                  e.  Section 89-130, Restrictions on uses in commercial and industrial districts. 
                  f.  Section 89-131, Sexually oriented businesses. 
                  g.  Section 89-132, Timber harvesting notice. 
                  h.  Division 4, Airport hazard zone restrictions. 
                  i.  Division 5, Prohibited uses. 
                  (c)  Special uses. Principal uses that are special uses may be allowed subject to special use approval procedures as set forth in the procedures and permits article (Article XII) of this Development Code. 
                  (d)  Prohibited uses. 
                  (1)  Any principal use not shown on the following Table 2.3 as allowed in a zoning district, whether by right or with approval as a special use or as a use permitted with restrictions, is specifically prohibited. 
                  (2)  Any accessory use not shown on the following Table 2.4 as allowed in a zoning district, whether by right or with approval as a special use or as a use permitted with restrictions, is specifically prohibited. 
                  (3)  In addition, uses, products and manufacturing processes that are specifically prohibited in all zoning districts are listed in the prohibited uses division of the restrictions on particular uses article of this Development Code. 
                  (e)  Interpretation of principal and accessory land uses. 
                  (1)  In addition to other generally accepted references and resources, the "North American Industrial Classification System" (NAICS), published by the U.S. Department of Commerce (2002 Edition), may be referred to in order to interpret the definition of uses listed on Table 2.3 and Table 2.4 and to identify similar uses that may be allowed along with each listed use. The NAICS classification number is shown on the tables for each applicable use category for reference and interpretation only; the NAICS is not adopted as part of this Development Code. 
                  (2)  The NAICS assigns classification numbers to businesses and industries based on the primary business activity in which the company is engaged. While business activity usually corresponds to land use type, and therefore can be easily assigned to appropriate zoning districts, there are exceptions. Some businesses may be primarily engaged in a certain industry—such as telecommunications, for instance, like BellSouth—but individual locations host notably different activities. For a company like BellSouth, for instance, different facilities may include retail stores for telephones, offices for administrative functions, satellite and exchange switching stations, and repair and installation staging lots where heavy equipment vehicles, telephone poles, wire spools and materials are stored. As a result, interpretation is occasionally needed for an individual use, regardless of the business activity in which the parent company is engaged. 
                  a.  If no NAICS classification number is shown on the table, there is no corresponding category to the land use listed. The use may be residential in nature (there are no NAICS categories for residences) or may be a land use activity not generally recognized as an individual business activity or industry type. 
                  b.  In all cases of uncertainty, the determination of whether or not a particular use is allowed in a particular zoning district shall reflect the purpose of the zoning district as stated in this article, both the common and dictionary definitions of the use, and similarity to the array of listed uses that are allowed in the district as to their character and intensity.

                  ARTICLE V. - SUBDIVISIONS AND MASTER PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS 

                  Sec. 89-461. - Purpose of article. 
                  This article presents the different ways that land can be subdivided and developed, ranging from conventional subdivisions, to open space subdivisions where green space and natural features are preserved by reducing lot sizes, to master planned developments which allow a wider variety of housing types in a well-planned mixed-use environment while also preserving green space and natural features. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 501) 
                  Sec. 89-462. - Minor subdivisions. 
                  (a)  Minor subdivisions; general. 
                  (1)  A "minor subdivision" is the subdivision of an original tract in which each lot has frontage on an existing county street or road, and the subdivision does not require the construction of a new street or the widening of an existing roadway, the provision of stormwater drainage facilities (other than driveway culverts), or the construction or improvement of any public utilities. 
                  (2)  Minor subdivisions, as more fully described under this section, shall be reviewed and processed as final subdivision plats under the provisions for such plats in the procedures and permits article of this Development Code. 
                  (3)  The term "original tract" as used in this section means the entire tract of land as it existed as a legal lot of record prior to the adoption of this Development Code. 
                  (b)  Types of minor subdivisions. Minor subdivisions are defined as, and limited to, any one of the following: 
                  (1)  Recombination. The sale or exchange of portions of adjoining lots between separate or common owners of adjoining properties, including the recombination of existing lots of record, provided that additional lots are not thereby created, and that all resulting lots are in accordance with the zoning and other provisions of this Development Code, and all other applicable laws and regulations. 
                  (2)  Nondevelopment land subdivisions. Divisions of property for which no new streets or roads are created or no new utility improvements are required or no new sanitary sewer or approval of septic tank is required. Any plat of survey containing thereon a certification from the licensed surveyor that the provisions relative to O.C.G.A. § 15-6-67(d) do not require approval shall be entitled to be recorded by the clerk of the superior court. 
                  (3)  Minor subdivision plat. The subdivision of an original tract that creates no more than 12 lots, building sites, or other divisions (including the remaining portion of the original tract) and meets the following criteria 
                  a.  Each lot shall front on an existing paved public road and meet the minimum requirements of the zoning district. 
                  b.  Each lot shall access the existing paved public road by way of a shared driveway unless approved for an individual driveway access by the public works department. 
                  c.  All slope and utility easements, as well as required street rights-of-way as determined by the director of planning based on the comprehensive plan, are provided at no cost to the county. 
                  d.  Each proposed lot shall comply with the requirements of the health department whose certification of approval shall be required prior to the approval of the final plat by the director of planning. 
                  e.  The potential location of a driveway connection serving each lot and meeting the requirements of these development regulations must be reviewed and approved by the public works department, and shall be indicated on the final subdivision plat. 
                  (4)  Estate subdivision. Estate subdivisions may be developed in the AG agricultural zoning district under the following provisions: 
                  a.  Each lot created by the subdivision, including the remaining portion of the original tract, must contain ten acres or more. 
                  b.  Each proposed lot shall provide at least 50 feet of frontage upon the street, shall provide at least 150 feet of lot width measured in accordance with the requirements of this Development Code, and shall meet or exceed all other minimum requirements of the AG zoning district. These dimensions must be increased to 100 feet of frontage and 300 feet of lot width if further subdivision (under subsection e. below) is anticipated or desired. 
                  c.  Each proposed lot abuts upon an existing public street. 
                  d.  All slope and utility easements, as well as required street rights-of-way, as determined by the director of planning based on the comprehensive plan, are provided at no cost to the county. 
                  e.  Each lot, thus created, may be re-subdivided into lots of no less than five acres as a minor subdivision pursuant to these regulations, provided that each such lot shall meet all requirements of this Development Code (including minimum lot width and frontage). 
                  f.  Each proposed lot shall comply with the requirements of the health department whose certification of approval shall be required prior to approval of the final plat by the director of planning. 
                  g.  The potential location of a driveway connection serving each lot and meeting the requirements of these development regulations must be reviewed and approved by the public works department, and shall be indicated on the final subdivision plat. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 502; Ord. of 11-28-2006, § 1; Ord. of 2-14-2017, § 3) 
                  Sec. 89-463. - Major subdivisions. 
                  (a)  Major subdivisions; defined. A "major subdivision" is any subdivision that does not qualify as a "minor subdivision" under section 89-462. A major subdivision requires construction of a new street or widening of an existing roadway, the provision of stormwater drainage facilities, or the construction or improvement of public utilities, or which otherwise has 12 or more lots (not in a large lot minor subdivision), building sites or other divisions. 
                  (b)  Types of major subdivisions. Major subdivisions fall into three categories for the purpose of development regulation: 
                  (1)  Conventional subdivisions, in which the maximum density allowed for the zoning district determines the maximum number of lots in the subdivision, and all of the lots meet the minimum lot size and other dimensional requirements for the zoning district as shown on Table 4.1 of Article IV. Open space outside of the lots may be created, but is not required. 
                  (2)  Open space subdivisions, in which the maximum density allowed for the zoning district determines the maximum number of lots in the subdivision, but the minimum lot size is reduced to allow for maximum flexibility on a site and in order to create conservation areas, open space and recreational amenities for the residents. 
                  (3)  Master planned developments, in which the zoning district density limitation may be increased as provided in this article and the minimum lot size of the zoning district is reduced in order to create open space and recreational amenities for the residents. Depending on the zoning district in which a master planned development is located, flexibility in housing types, mixed-use projects and certain commercial uses are allowed. 
                  The following table presents a summary of the requirements of this article as they apply to each of the three types of major subdivisions. Refer to the text and other tables of this article for specific provisions. 
                  Summary Comparison of Major Subdivisions 

                   
                  * All requirements of Article IV apply to conventional subdivisions. 
                  ** Not applicable. All open space subdivisions and master planned developments must be connected to a public water system except in the AG and AR zoning districts. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 503; Ord. of 9-12-2017, § 1) 
                  Sec. 89-464. - Conventional subdivisions. 
                  (a)  Maximum number of lots. The maximum number of lots (or dwelling units) in a conventional subdivision shall be determined by the density allowed for the zoning district and the comprehensive plan land use designation where the subdivision is located, multiplied times the gross acreage of the subdivision site. 
                  (b)  Minimum lot size. In a conventional subdivision, the lot area per dwelling unit shown on Table 4.1 of Article IV establishes the minimum lot size for each lot. 
                  (c)  Minimum lot width, setbacks. The lot width and setback requirements of Article IV apply to each lot in a conventional subdivision. 
                  (d)  Other lot and building standards. All other lot and building standards contained in Article IV and not modified under this section shall apply to conventional subdivisions. 
                  (e)  Conservation, open space and recreation. Requirements regarding the protection of primary conservation areas in natural resource easements and the provision of recreation amenities in conventional subdivisions can be found under section 89-467. 
                  (f)  Reserved. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 504; Ord. of 2-14-2017, § 2) 
                  Sec. 89-465. - Open space subdivisions. 
                  Open space development provisions may be applied to any residential subdivision in any zoning district. In addition to any conditions of zoning approval that may apply to a specific property, the following shall apply to all such subdivisions: 
                  (1)  Maximum number of lots. An open space subdivision shall not exceed the overall maximum density of dwelling units per acre allowed for the zoning district under Table 4.1 of Article IV. The maximum number of lots shall not exceed the maximum density allowed under Table 4.1 times the gross acreage of the site. 
                  (2)  Minimum lot size. The minimum lot size per dwelling unit shall be established as part of the preliminary subdivision plat (see project approval under the procedures and permits article of this Development Code), provided that all lots shall comply with health department requirements depending on the source of water supply and method of sewage disposal. 
                  (3)  Location of structures; lot widths and setbacks. 
                  a.  Minimum lot widths and building setbacks shall be established through approval of the preliminary subdivision plat. However the following restrictions shall apply: 
                  1.  Principal buildings within the development, if separated, shall not be less than 20 feet apart. 
                  2.  Every dwelling unit shall have direct access to a street, court, walkway or other area dedicated to public use. 
                  3.  Health department requirements regarding lot sizes using on-site sewerage disposal shall be met. 
                  b.  The front or rear face of a dwelling unit shall be not less than 50 feet from the front or rear face of another dwelling unit. The unattached side face of a single-family attached building shall be not less than 40 feet from the rear face of another such building or unit. 
                  c.  No dwelling unit shall be situated so as to face the rear of another dwelling unit within the subdivision unless terrain differences or vegetation will provide effective visual separation. 
                  (4)  Other lot and building standards. All other lot and building standards contained in Article IV and not modified under this section shall apply to open space subdivisions. 
                  (5)  Conservation, open space and recreation. Requirements regarding the protection of primary conservation areas in conservation easements, the provision of common open space and the provision of recreation amenities in open space subdivisions can be found under section 89-467. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 505) 
                  Sec. 89-466. - Master planned developments. 
                  The master planned development provides a development opportunity that mixes types of housing and nonresidential properties within the same development. 
                  (1)  Special approval required. Because master planned developments allow housing types and nonresidential uses that may not otherwise be allowed in the zoning district, approval of a special use is required in accordance with the permits and procedures article of this Development Code. 
                  (2)  Criteria for approval. 
                  a.  Master planned developments (MPDs) are encouraged in appropriate locations throughout the county that allow the use of innovative techniques, such as traditional neighborhood design, resource conservation subdivisions, village concepts and mixed use development. Such master planned developments must provide compatible and unified development while allowing flexibility within the current zoning regulations. 
                  b.  All MPDs must propose innovative design, the protection and accommodation of important natural resources and open space. MPDs are reviewed individually to determine compatibility, suitability, and health, safety and welfare issues. Individual requirements relating to such developments become part of the concept plan through conditions of zoning. 
                  c.  Review criteria. The following is a list of criteria that will be used by the county to determine the suitability of a proposed MPD in addition to the standards for approval of a special use contained in the procedures and permits article of this Development Code: 
                  1.  The uses proposed will not be detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses. 
                  2.  Exceptions from this Development Code are warranted by the design and amenities incorporated in the development plan. 
                  3.  Master planned development is in conformance with the general intent of this Development Code and the comprehensive plan. 
                  4.  Every MPD must be deemed by the board of commissioners to incorporate features of exceptional architectural, landscaping or site design prior to MPD approval. Such plans upon which this determination is made shall be incorporated into the MPD approval of the project. 
                  (3)  Development parameters. The following general conditions apply to master planned developments (MPDs) according to the zoning district of the property: 
                  a.  The proportion and distribution of nonresidential to residential uses in a MPD is determined by the zoning category of the property. The zoning district also determines the maximum number of dwelling units and the type of commercial development that can be allowed in the MPD. These limitations and the distribution of residential density are shown on Table 5.1. 
                  Table 5.1: Land Use Distribution in a Master Planned Development 

                   
                  b.  When "neighborhood commercial" is allowed, development of the commercial area shall be controlled by the C-1 district provisions, except as modified by this section. 
                  c.  When "community commercial" is allowed, development of the commercial area shall be controlled by the C-2 district provisions, except as modified by this section. 
                  d.  Commercial structures and uses are to be located and designed as a unified development where feasible. As an addition to the C-1 and C-2 district provisions, residential and commercial uses may either be located in freestanding buildings within a site, or combined together within the same building. 
                  e.  All master planned developments must provide internal pedestrian access. The type of access such as sidewalks, bike paths, lanes and trails, will be established during the review period to determine the best way to serve a particular development. 
                  (4)  Maximum number of dwelling units. 
                  a.  A master planned development shall not exceed the overall maximum density of dwelling units per acre allowed, plus ten percent. The maximum number of lots, townhouse units and multi-family units shall not exceed the maximum density allowed for the zoning district under Table 4.1 of Article IV (including streets, open space and nonresidential areas) plus ten percent for each area designated on the concept plan. (For MPDs in the C-1, C-2 or C-3 zoning districts, the residential densities allowed in the R-3 zoning district for each type of use shall be used, plus ten percent.) 
                  b.  Loft dwelling units in commercial buildings shall not be included in the development density calculations. The number of loft units allowed shall be established as part of the special use approval for the MPD. 
                  (5)  Minimum lot size. The minimum lot size per dwelling unit shall be dependent on the source of water supply and method of sewage disposal and shall be established through the approval of the master planned development concept plan.

                  2.  Development standards. 
                  i.  Any multi-family, commercial or institutional property or portion of such a property that is located within a through-road corridor shall provide at least 20 percent of its gross land area in landscaping. Landscape areas and treatments shall be identified on the site plan for the development, subject to approval by the county. 
                  ii.  No buildings with metal exterior facades will be permitted within the corridor, nor shall any metal facade buildings be visible from the corridor. Metal roofs, including mansard roofs, are not considered part of a facade. 
                  iii.  In addition to buffer requirements, when the back of a commercial or industrial development is across the street from property in a residential district outside of the master planned development, then a solid fence or hedge not less than six feet in height shall be installed and maintained by the developer to screen the back of the project from the residential property. 
                  iv.  Single-family and two-family lots within a through road corridor shall not have driveway access from the through road. 
                  (9)  Other lot and building standards. All other lot and building standards contained in Article IV and not modified under this section shall apply to master planned developments. 
                  (10)  Conservation, open space and recreation. Requirements regarding the protection of primary conservation areas in conservation easements, the provision of common open space and private open space, and the provision of recreation amenities in master planned developments can be found under section 89-467.

                  Sec. 89-467. - Resource conservation, open space and recreation amenities. 
                  (a)  Natural resource or conservation easement required. 
                  (1)  All primary conservation areas in a conventional subdivision, open space subdivision or master planned development that are required to be protected by the provisions of this Development Code, shall be permanently protected from further subdivision, development, and unauthorized use, by a natural resource or conservation easement. 
                  (2)  Land within a natural resource or conservation easement may be included within the lots in a subdivision, or ownership may be transferred to a homeowners' association or to a nonprofit conservation organization or land trust organized under Georgia law. 
                  (3)  See the environmental protection article of this Development Code regarding natural resource and conservation easements. 
                  (b)  Common open space. In an open space subdivision or a master planned development, a minimum percent of the gross project site area shall be reserved for common open space and recreation, as follows: 
                  (1)  At least ten percent total site in an open space subdivision and 20 percent in a master planned development must be set aside as open space for conservation, preservation or passive recreational use, such as walking trails and picnicking. Except in the R-1 zoning district, the minimum required open space shall be exclusive of all areas classified in the environmental protection article of this Development Code as primary conservation areas; such areas may be included in the minimum open space in the R-1 zoning district. 
                  (2)  Areas classified as secondary conservation areas in the environmental protection article of this Development Code are to be given preference for inclusion in the minimum required open space. 
                  (3)  Land devoted to stormwater detention facilities may not be counted toward the minimum unless the facility is a permanent lake or pond, and is designed and intended for recreational access and use by the occupants of the development. 
                  (4)  Additional common open space may be provided and may include active recreation areas for the proposed development, such as swimming pools, tennis courts, community facilities, etc. 
                  (5)  Required buffers on the perimeter of the property may be included in the minimum open space requirement. 
                  (6)  While common open space shall not be required to be contiguous, no individual portion of the minimum required open space shall be less than one acre in size, nor less that 50 feet wide in its narrowest dimension, except as follows: 
                  a.  The open space area, by the very nature of its designated boundaries, is less than 50 feet in width. Examples include strips of steep slopes and "fingers" of floodplains that extend up drainage swales. 
                  b.  Parkways between road travelways, which must be at least 26 feet in width in order to be counted as part of the minimum requirement. 
                  c.  Viewshed protection areas intended to screen the view of the subdivision development, if provided, must be at least 200 feet in width unless the topography of the land adequately screens the view of the buildings in the subdivision from the abutting roadway. 
                  (7)  No portion of the residential lots shall be credited toward the minimum open space requirement. No portion of any street right-of-way or public or private utility easement shall be credited toward the minimum open space requirements. 
                  (8)  The required common open space shall be platted at the same time that adjacent residential lots are platted, in whole or in phases. 
                  (c)  Private open space. In a master planned development, every single-family or two-family dwelling on a lot smaller than 10,000 square feet, and every townhouse dwelling shall have a minimum 400 square foot private yard or patio. 
                  (1)  The private yard or patio shall be arranged for use by the occupants of the dwelling and located in the side or rear yard. 
                  (2)  The private yard or patio must be enclosed by any combination of the following: a masonry wall, wood fence, trellis or lattice with a minimum height of six feet; or an evergreen hedge, shrubs or trees that will achieve a height of six feet within three years of planting under normal growing conditions. 
                  (d)  Recreation amenity. 
                  (1)  Every conventional subdivision, open space subdivision or master planned development having any single-family detached lots less than two acres in size and proposed to contain more than a total of 24 dwelling units of any type may include a community recreation amenity to serve the development, based on the number of dwelling units in the development. 
                  (2)  If the development is to include community recreational facilities, then Table 5.2 establishes minimum requirements. 
                  Table 5.2: Recreation Amenities 

                   
                  1  Children's play area including active play equipment. Multiple play areas are allowed, but none less than ½ acre in size.

                  (3)  All amenities shall be completed and available for use prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy on more than 50 percent of the dwellings in the development. 
                  (4)  The recreation amenity may be designed to serve the entire development or separate amenity areas may be provided for specific residential development areas. If multiple recreation amenity areas are provided, the total of all amenities shall be no less than the total required by Table 5.2 based on the entire development as a whole, distributed proportionally to each development area based on the number of dwelling units each amenity area serves. 
                  (5)  Such recreation amenity areas may not be developed within a primary resource area. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 507) 
                  Sec. 89-468. - Owner's association. 
                  (a)  Homeowner's association; when required. For any residential development containing common open space or other lands in common ownership, a homeowner's association which provides for building and grounds maintenance and repair, insurance and working capital shall be required. 
                  (1)  Membership in the homeowner's association must be mandatory for each property in the development. 
                  (2)  Such associations must also include homeowner's declaration and bylaws, including covenants, conditions and regulations applicable to each property in the development. 
                  (3)  The declaration and bylaws shall be enforced by the association or by an association management company designated by them, which shall have the power to compel the payment of membership dues and assessments. 
                  (4)  The homeowners' association shall be formed under the provisions of O.C.G.A. Title 44, Chapter 3, Article 6, which is known as the "Georgia Property Owners' Association Act" (Code 1981, §§ 44-3-220 et seq. enacted by Ga. L. 1994, p. 1879, § 1) and shall contain adequate provisions to qualify it as a "holder" under the Georgia Uniform Conservation Easement Act, if it is to act as a holder of a conservation easement. 
                  (5)  The documents creating the homeowner's association must provide that an adequate reserve fund for the association will exist at the time that control of the association transfers from the developer to the purchasers of homes in the development. The reserve fund must be equal to no less than one year's expenses reasonably expected for the minimum operations legally required of the association. 
                  (6)  The covenants, conditions and regulations shall, at a minimum, regulate and control the following: 
                  a.  Equal access and right of use to all shared facilities; 
                  b.  Perpetual and continued maintenance of open and shared space, specifically including stormwater detention facilities;

                  ARTICLE VI. - PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS 

                  Sec. 89-721. - Purpose of article. 
                  This article presents the minimum standards for vehicle parking for all land uses in the county (including design and construction standards), minimum standards for truck loading, and requirements for the provision of landscaping related to parking and loading areas. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 601) 
                  Sec. 89-722. - Off-street parking; when required. 
                  Permanent off-street parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of this article whenever any of the following occurs: 
                  (1)  At the time of the establishment of any use, or erection of any building. 
                  (2)  At the time of occupancy of a building by a new use. 
                  (3)  At the time any principal building is enlarged or increased in capacity by adding dwelling units, guest rooms, seats or floor area. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 602) 
                  Sec. 89-723. - Parking plans required. 
                  A parking plan for all but detached single-family and two-family residential uses shall be submitted to the director of planning with the building plans. He shall review the proposed parking plan with the director of public works to insure its conformance with all applicable provisions of this resolution and with the Barrow County development regulations. The director of planning shall not allow occupancy or use of a building until he ascertains that its related parking facilities are completed in accordance with the approved plan. The provision of the required spaces on a temporary basis on a hard-surface sub-base (sub-grade plus an asphalt first layer or bound crushed stone aggregate) shall satisfy this requirement. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 603) 
                  Sec. 89-724. - Number of parking spaces required. 
                  (a)  Parking for residents, employees, customers and visitors. Space for the parking of motor vehicles must be provided on every property that contains a principal use, for the safety and convenience of the people who live or work on the property, shop or do business on the property, or otherwise visit the property in the normal course of activity of the principal use. 
                  (1)  Minimum number of parking spaces required. The minimum number of off-street parking spaces to be provided for residents, employees, customers and visitors for each type of land use shall be determined by the following Table 6.1, rounded up to the nearest whole parking space. Developments containing two or more of the uses listed on Table 6.1 shall provide the number of spaces required for each use (except as may be reduced under shared parking, below). 
                  (2)  Maximum number of parking spaces allowed. 
                  a.  Nonresidential uses. The maximum number of parking spaces allowed on a nonresidential property for employees, customers and visitors shall not exceed 120 percent of the minimum number of parking spaces required, as determined for the type of land use by the following Table 6.1. 
                  b.  Residential uses. The maximum number of outdoor spaces per dwelling unit, including those located within a carport, shall not exceed five. Additional spaces may be located within an enclosed garage. 
                  (3)  Deviation from parking requirements. 
                  a.  Notwithstanding the minimum and maximum requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection (a), the county recognizes that due to the particulars of any given development, the inflexible application of the parking standards set forth therein may result in a development either with inadequate parking space or parking space in excess of its needs. The former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations on adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby lots; the latter situation is inefficient. Therefore, the director of planning may administratively allow deviations from the minimum or maximum parking requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) whenever they find that the requested deviation is justified by the described development and will not adversely impact traffic circulation or public health, safety and welfare. 
                  b.  The number of parking spaces required for a development shall be based upon the anticipated parking demand of individual uses based upon the operating characteristics of the individual use. The director of planning shall base their decision for such deviation on site and operational plans submitted in support of the requested deviation and such other documents as the director of planning may reasonably determine are necessary to determine the number of parking spaces required for the development. 
                  c.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the director of planning shall not authorize a deviation to the number of parking spaces by below 75 percent of the minimum required spaces or above 25 percent of the maximum required spaces. Requests for greater deviations shall be treated as a hardship variance pursuant to the requirements of article XIII.

Every business that stores vehicles owned by the business on site overnight (such as a company fleet), or maintains a stock of vehicles as part of its business activities (such as a car sales lot, a salvage and wrecking yard, car rental agency, etc.), shall provide for adequate parking or storage for the vehicles such that no parking occurs in a public right-of-way or in an area that has not been improved as a parking lot or storage yard. Such parking spaces shall be in addition to those required for residents, employees, customers and visitors. 
                  (c)  Maneuvering lanes not considered parking. Areas designated for temporary occupancy of vehicles while maneuvering on a site, such as queuing lanes for a drive-in window, are not considered parking spaces.

                  (a)  In any residential district, it shall be unlawful to park wreckers, dump trucks, flat-bed trucks, tow trucks, mechanical earthmoving equipment or any commercial vehicle except that such vehicles used exclusively for an agricultural purpose on a parcel may be parked in an AG or AR district. 
                  (b)  It shall be unlawful to park travel trailers, recreational vehicles, campers, motorized homes, boats, personal watercraft, wave runners, all-terrain vehicles or trailers of any type in the front yard, or in any other yard, except as hereinafter provided, in any residential district. In residential districts, travel trailers, recreational vehicles, campers, motorized homes, boats, personal watercraft, wave runners, all-terrain vehicles and trailers may only be parked or stored in an enclosed garage or carport or in rear or side yards, provided that they remain more than 20 feet from the rear property line and ten feet from the side property line. 
                  (c)  No such vehicle shall be occupied for sleeping or as a residence, either permanently or temporarily, when so parked. 
                  (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a school bus may be parked on property owned or occupied by the school bus operator provided that all of the following conditions are met: 
                  (1)  Zoning and minimum lot area. The parcel must be a minimum of five acres in size and zoned agricultural (AG) or agricultural-residential (AR); provided, however, that the parking of school buses shall be prohibited on any parcel that is part of a platted residential subdivision, regardless of zoning classification and parcel size. 
                  (2)  Access to the parcel shall be from a public street. In order to protect the integrity of paved public streets, a minimum of ten feet of paved or concrete driveway or apron shall abut the paved public street at the property access point to be utilized by the school bus. The above requirement for a paved driveway or apron shall not apply if the parcel's direct access is from an unpaved public street. 
                  (3)  Vehicle parking location. The school bus shall be parked within the rear yard of the parcel, outside of all required setbacks and/or buffers. 
                  (4)  Parking area surface. Unless the school bus is otherwise parked or stored in an enclosed structure, the school bus shall be parked upon a concrete or gravel surface of sufficient size to accommodate all wheels of the school bus. 
                  (5)  Limit of one vehicle. No more than one school bus may be parked on a parcel as otherwise permitted by this subsection.

                  Sec. 89-727. - Off-site parking. 
                  If required parking spaces are not located on the same lot as the particular use, building or establishment they are intended to serve, the following shall apply: 
                  (1)  The parking spaces must be located on a property that has the same zoning classification as the property that the spaces serve, or a less restrictive zoning classification. 
                  (2)  No required parking spaces may be located across any state or US highway from the use they are intended to serve unless a signaled cross-walk is provided. 
                  (3)  An easement (or other recordable instrument satisfactory to the director of planning) dedicating the off-site parking to the property that the spaces serve shall be recorded with the clerk of the superior court and a copy provided to the director of planning. The document must be written to survive future changes in ownership in perpetuity, unless the agreement is dissolved with approval by the board of commissioners. 
                  (4)  Off-site parking spaces shall be located in proximity to the use that the spaces serve, in accordance with the locational requirements of Table 6.3, above, or transportation services shall be provided, such as a shuttle bus.

                  Sec. 89-728. - Joint use of parking facilities. 
                  The required parking space for a number of separate uses may be combined in one lot, but the required space assigned to one use may not be assigned to another use at the same time, except as follows: 
                  (1)  Shared parking between day and night users. One-half of the parking spaces required for churches, theaters or assembly halls whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sundays may be assigned to a use which will be closed at night and on Sundays. 
                  (2)  Mixed use developments. Parking spaces may be shared by more than one use if the director of planning finds that the total number of spaces will be adequate at the peak hours of the uses they serve. The ratios on Table 6.4 may be used in determining the time of day and the day of the week at which the maximum number of spaces will be needed by the uses served by the shared parking facility. 
                  (3)  Availability of shared spaces. Parking spaces that are proposed to be shared among two or more uses must be clearly available to each use and not appear in any way to be serving a particular use, either through signage dedicating the spaces or through design techniques that would tend to orient use of the spaces to a particular business or building. 
                  (4)  Recordation of shared parking agreement. Shared parking arrangements must be committed to writing in an instrument acceptable to the director of planning, and approved by the owners of each of the affected properties or uses. The instrument must be approved by the director of planning and shall be recorded with the clerk of the superior court, and a copy of the recorded document must be supplied to the director of planning. The document must be written to survive future changes in ownership in perpetuity, unless the agreement is dissolved with approval by the board of commissioners.

                  Sec. 89-729. - Design requirements for parking lots. 
                  Except for single-family detached and two family residential uses (unless otherwise noted), the provisions of this section apply to all off-street parking spaces and parking areas, whether the parking meets or exceeds the number of spaces required to serve a particular use or the parking lot is operated as a principal use on a property and not dedicated to serving a particular use. 
                  (1)  Orientation to street. 
                  a.  All areas devoted to off-street parking shall be so designed and be of such size that no vehicle is required to back into a public street to obtain access. 
                  b.  The distance from a parking area access drive to the intersection of two streets, and the distance between driveways at the street right-of-way between adjacent properties, shall not be less than 20 feet for a single-family or two-family dwelling and not less than 50 feet for all other uses. Distances must be measured from the back of the driveway curb at the right-of-way line (or from the edge of the driveway if curbs are not required). 
                  c.  The number of driveways that access a property from any one street, road or highway shall be limited as follows: 
                  1.  A permit to access a state road must be obtained from the Georgia Department of Transportation and submitted to the director of public works before the driveway access can be approved. 
                  2.  Along state or U.S. numbered highways, and along all other major collector and arterial thoroughfares, no more than one point of vehicular access from a property shall be permitted for each 300 feet of lot frontage, or fraction thereof. 
                  3.  Along all other streets or roads, no more than two points of vehicular access from a property to each abutting public road shall be permitted for each 400 feet of lot frontage, or fraction thereof; provided however, that lots with 150 feet of frontage or less shall have no more than one point of access to any one public street. The director of public works shall determine whether the points of access may be unrestricted or will have to be designed for right-in, right-out traffic flow. 
                  (2)  Off-street parking spaces. 
                  a.  No parking spaces shall be accessible directly from an access driveway within the first 30 feet of the driveway back from the street right-of-way line. 
                  b.  Every parking space shall provide a useable rectangular area at least nine feet wide by 20 feet long. Access aisles shall not encroach into this minimum rectangular area. 
                  c.  Every parking space shall be clearly demarcated by lines painted on or otherwise applied to the parking lot surface. 
                  (3)  Access and circulation. 
                  a.  Access aisles in parking lots must be at least 24 feet wide serving spaces that are perpendicular (90 degrees) to the access aisle, and provide for two-way traffic. Access aisles serving spaces that are oblique (slanted) to the access aisle shall be limited to one-way traffic, and shall have the following minimum widths: 18 feet wide serving spaces that are at a 60 degree angle to the aisle, and 13 feet wide serving spaces that are at a 45 degree angle to the aisle. (See the parking illustration, below.) Angles less than 45 degree to the access aisle are not allowed, except for parking spaces that are parallel to the access aisle. 
                  b.  One-way traffic aisles must be clearly marked with directional arrows on the pavement at each intersection with another aisle. 
                  c.  Ingress and egress to parking areas shall be by means of paved driveways from the adjoining street. 
                  1.  The minimum width of driveways for ingress and egress shall be the same as those specified above for aisles. Driveway width, for the purpose of this section, shall include only the pavement and not the curbs and gutters. 
                  2.  The slope of ingress and egress driveways at their connection to the adjoining street shall not exceed that allowed by county specifications for landings at residential street intersections. 

                   Figure 14. Parking illustration 
                  (4)  Setback requirements; parking lots. 
                  a.  No parking shall be established in the minimum required front setback of any residential zoning district except for a single-family or two-family residential use, nor shall more than 35 percent of this required front yard be paved or used for parking under any circumstances. 
                  b.  Unenclosed off-street parking for single-family and two-family dwellings shall have no setback requirements. 
                  c.  Off-street parking for all other uses, including multi-family residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional uses, shall be setback from the front property line by at least ten feet. An additional ten-foot setback from any buffer required along a side or rear property line shall also be maintained. 
                  d.  The required setback area between the front property line and the parking area shall be used for landscaping and/or screening as required in section 89-734, below. 
                  (5)  Lighting of parking areas. 
                  a.  Adequate lighting shall be provided if the facilities are to be used at night. Any lights used to illuminate the parking area shall be arranged, located or screened to direct light away from any adjoining residential use. "Shoe box" recessed lighting fixtures on poles, and motion-detector security lighting, shall be utilized for this purpose. 
                  b.  Lighting standards in and surrounding parking lots shall not conflict with tree locations, considering the height and breadth of the trees normally achieved at maturity and their root systems. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 609) 
                  Sec. 89-730. - Inter-parcel access. 
                  (a)  Internal access easements required. Inter-parcel access shall be achieved by means of shared driveway easements between properties. The purpose of the easement is to facilitate movement of customers from business to business without generating additional turning movements on the public streets which best protects the interest of the public heath, safety and welfare. 
                  (b)  Access easement provisions. The easement shall permit automobile access from the adjoining property to driveways and parking areas intended for customer or tenant use; but parking spaces may be restricted to use by the owner's customers and tenants only. 
                  (1)  Inter-parcel vehicle access shall be required between automobile parking areas on all contiguous parcels within the nonresidential zoning districts and between all other contiguous nonresidential uses when the parking areas are or will be in reasonable proximity to one another. 
                  (2)  On all surface drives (i.e., inter-parcel streets that are not government owned or maintained), curb cuts may be located no closer than 20 feet from a property line. 
                  (3)  All access easements shall be no less than 28 feet in width and shall be wide enough to permit two-way vehicular traffic to and from the adjoining properties. 
                  (4)  Inter-parcel access shall not be allowed within 35 feet of the right-of-way of any public street or road. 
                  (c)  Relief. Requirements of this section may only be waived by the director of public works when it is adequately demonstrated that the adverse impact of the required easements on use of the subject property would outweigh the reduced impact on public streets provided by reciprocal easements. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 610) 
                  Sec. 89-731. - Improvement of parking areas.

                  (1)  All off-street parking areas and all access drives except for single-family and two-family dwellings, and within the agricultural districts shall be improved with a permanent dust-free surface consisting of a minimum of a six-inch graded aggregate base overlaid with a minimum two-inch Type E or F asphalt surface, or an appropriate alternative porous paving surface as approved by the director of public works. 
                  (2)  The parking of any vehicle on any lot in any district on other than a surface treated and hardened to accommodate this vehicle is prohibited except as provided herein. In addition, parking vehicles in the front yard or in front of the principal building line in an R district shall be prohibited except on a hard-surfaced driveway or in a carport or garage. 
                  (3)  In the commercial and the industrial zoning districts, the above type of surface is required for customer, visitor, and employee automobile parking. In these zoning districts the following surface will be required in areas of loading docks and parking of commercial trucks and other commercial equipment: 
                  a.  A eight-inch graded aggregate base, overlaid with a two-inch Type B binder and a 1½-inch Type E or F asphalt surface; or, 
                  b.  A ten-inch graded aggregate base, overlaid with a 12-inch course of 3,000 P.S.I. concrete. 
                  (4)  Curb and gutter meeting county specifications shall be installed around the periphery of every parking lot and loading area, where required for drainage, and extend along both sides of every access drive between the parking lot or loading area and the street or another parking lot or loading area, as applicable. 
                  (5)  The minimum thickness specified above shall be evaluated for each application to determine adequacy for projected traffic. 
                  (b)  Maintenance. Off-street parking areas shall be maintained in proper repair with a dust-free surface. 
                  (c)  Drainage facilities. For any use that will require a parking area of five spaces or more, or a loading area, to be newly constructed, added to, or altered in such a way as to affect drainage either on or off the site, stormwater drainage plans, including grading plans, shall be submitted to and approved by the director of public works, prior to the issuance of a building permit or occupational license. 
                  (d)  Permit required. Construction of a new parking lot or loading area, or expansion of an existing parking lot or loading area, requires issuance of a development permit in accordance with the procedures and permits article of this Development Code. 
                  (e)  Time limit. All required off-street parking areas shall be ready for use, including the above surfacing requirement, before the occupancy of the use (in the case of a new building or addition) or within 45 days after the issuance of an occupational license (in the case of a change of occupancy in an existing building). An extension of time may be granted by the director of public works due to adverse weather conditions.

                  (b)  Setback requirements; loading areas. 
                  (1)  Off-street truck loading areas shall be setback from the front property line by at least ten feet. An additional ten-foot setback from any buffer required along a side or rear property line shall also be maintained. 
                  (2)  The required setback area between the front property line and the truck loading area shall be used for landscaping and/or screening as required in section 89-734 below. 
                  (c)  Truck loading on public streets . The loading or unloading of business merchandise, supplies, goods or freight within a street right-of-way is prohibited in all zoning districts. Loading or unloading of furniture, equipment, or fixtures for the purpose of a home or business relocation may be allowed within a street right-of-way if: 
                  (1)  The street is classified as a "local" street as defined in this Development Code; and 
                  (2)  Vehicular and pedestrian access is not completely blocked on the street; or 
                  (3)  The sheriff's department otherwise grants approval based on a determination that adequate traffic safety measures are implemented during the period of loading or unloading.

                  (a)  Basis for restrictions imposed. 
                  (1)  The commission has considered the aesthetic and safety reasons for limiting signage in the unincorporated areas of the county. The commission has determined that signs can detract from the aesthetic beauty of the county. Further, unregulated sign proliferation may contribute to a lowering of commercial and residential property values. Lastly, signs can be detrimental to the safety of motorists in the county. It is found by the commission that limiting the number, type, and dimension of signs in accordance with the following regulations will serve these substantial governmental and community interests. 
                  (2)  The commission is well aware that signs are a means by which the county's residents, organizations, institutions, and businesses may convey constitutionally protected commercial and noncommercial messages. The following regulations provide an appropriate balance between the right to communicate via signs and the protection of the community interests stated above. 
                  (b)  Regulation of signs. No sign shall be placed or maintained on any property, building or other structure within Barrow County except in conformity with these Sign Regulations. 
                  (c)  Intent of sign regulations; free speech. Notwithstanding any other restrictions in this article, any sign authorized under this article can contain any commercial or non-commercial message, other than messages containing nudity or obscenity as defined herein, or other than a sign that advertises an activity that is illegal under Georgia or federal laws.

                  b.  For signs that have no identifiable frame or border, the smallest rectangle that includes all of the sign's words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements intended to convey the sign's message shall establish the area of the sign's face. 
                  c.  For signs applied to a kiosk or other cylindrical sign structure, the area of the sign face shall be computed as the largest rectangular area achieved from any one view of the sign. Measurements shall be made as a flat plane rectangle projected on the sign. 
                  d.  The computation of the area of a sign face shall not include the structure, supports, or uprights on which the sign face is placed or any portions of a sign structure that are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature, other than those portions contained within the rectangle that delimits the sign face or a sign module. 


                  e.  Manual changeable copy signs. For any sign on which any of the words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements are routinely changed or are intended to be changed from time to time the sign face area shall include the entire area within which any words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements may be placed, together with any frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed. 
                  (2)  Sign structure area. 
                  a.  The area of a sign structure shall be computed as the area within the smallest rectangle enclosing the limits of the surface of a sign whereon the sign face or sign modules may be placed, including all portions of a sign structure that provide a background for the sign face but are not intended to contain any message or idea and are purely structural or decorative in nature. 

                  b.  For a kiosk or other cylindrical sign structure, the area of the sign structure shall be the largest measurement achieved from any view of the sign structure. Measurements shall be made as a flat plane rectangle projected on or bisecting the sign structure. 
                  c.  Project entrance signs. For project entrance signs or other signs that are imposed, mounted or painted on a wall or other decorative structure, the sign structure area shall be computed as that portion of such wall or other decorative structure that is discernibly devoted to the support of the sign or, by its design or architectural treatment, intended to provide a background or frame for the sign. 
                  (3)  Treatment of open spaces. Any open space contained within the limits of the rectangle delimiting the sign face, sign module, or sign structure shall be included in the computation of the area of such sign face, sign module, or sign structure. 
                  (4)  Multi-faced signs. 
                  a.  Double-faced signs. For double-faced signs, when the sign face surfaces are parallel (back-to-back), or where the smallest angle formed between the two faces is 60 degrees or less, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area on the largest side. For double-faced signs where the interior angle formed by the faces is more than 60 degrees, the area of the sign shall be the total area of all sides. 
                  b.  Signs with three or more faces. For sign structures having only three faces and the interior angle formed between all of the faces is 60 degrees, the area of the sign shall be taken as the area on the largest side. For all other multi-faced signs with three or more sides, the area of the sign shall be the largest total of all faces that are joined by an interior angle of more than 60 degrees that can be viewed from any one direction. 
                  (b)  Measurement of sign height. The height of a sign shall be equal to the vertical distance from the average grade at the base of the sign, or from the crown of the roadway of the nearest street within 50 feet of any portion of the sign, to the highest point of any portion of the sign, whichever results in the greater sign height. Any earthen berm or elevated foundation constructed to support a sign, its signposts or other sign supports, shall be included in the height of the sign.

                  The following Table 7.1 and Table 7.2 present the maximum number, size, height, and other restrictions relating to specific signage that are permitted by right in each land use category. Additional signage is permitted under section 89-789, section 89-790, section 89-791, section 89-792 and section 89-793 of this article. 
                  (a)  Principal freestanding sign—One use on property. "Principal freestanding sign—One use on property" on Table 7.1 applies to a lot where there is only one use being made of the property, such as but not limited to one single-family or two-family dwelling, one multi-family development, or one business occupant. A predominantly agricultural property, with or without a residence on the property, is considered a single agricultural use. Properties that are vacant but zoned for a particular land use also fall under this category (see section 89-783(a) for specific definitions of land use categories). 
                  (b)  Principal freestanding sign—Planned center. "Principal freestanding sign—Planned center" on Table 7.1 applies to a single commercial or industrial property that is designed or intended for occupancy by two or more principal businesses that are separately-owned and have no corporate relationship. A planned center may consist of several businesses in a single building or individual businesses in several buildings on the same lot. In contrast, see "shopping centers" under section 89-789 and "office parks" under section 89-790, below. 
                  (c)  Building signs. For building signs permitted on Table 7.2, the following shall apply: 
                  (1)  For a single-occupant building, the maximum allowed area for a building sign on a wall shall be calculated on the basis of the length of said wall (or as a percentage of the wall area), including all windows and doors, as shown on Table 7.2. 
                  (2)  For multi-tenant buildings, the maximum allowed area for each building sign for each tenant shall be calculated on the basis of the length of the wall (or as a percentage of the wall area), including all windows and doors, of that portion of the structure occupied by the tenant. 
                  (3)  No wall sign, projecting sign, canopy sign or other building sign shall be located so that any part of the sign or its support extends above the top of the wall or canopy and no sign copy shall be located within five inches of the top of the sign. 
                  (4)  Under canopy signs shall extend perpendicular to the wall and shall be attached at a uniform height. 
                  (5)  Projecting and under-canopy signs shall be limited to no more than 1 per tenant on a property, and each tenant shall have no more than 1 projecting sign or under-canopy sign, for each street that the tenant faces. 
                  (6)  In no case shall a window sign obscure more than 25 percent of a window. Any neon window sign that is allowed shall be constant in its light emission, shall not be animated and shall not be so large or of a character to obscure vision into the premises from the outside. 
                  (d)  Master planned development. For signs in a master planned development (MPD), each property or individual development within the MPD shall conform to the sign regulations established as part of the zoning approval for the MPD. If no such regulations exist, each property or individual development within a master planned development shall conform to the provisions of this article in accordance with the land use category of said property or individual development.

                  TABLE 7.3: NUMBER OF PRINCIPAL FREESTANDING SIGNS ALLOWED IN A SHOPPING CENTER 

                   
                  1  One additional sign is allowed if a multi-screen cinema complex is located in the shopping center. See section 89-781(a). 
                  a.  A freestanding sign meeting the specifications of this section is permitted for each out-parcel developed as an integral part of the shopping center. 
                  b.  Each freestanding sign in a shopping center shall identify the street number of the shopping center. The identification of the street number shall not be included within the square footage allotted for the copy area of the freestanding sign. Such numbers shall be a minimum of eight inches in height or such greater size as to be readable from the public street which affords the principal means of access to the shopping center. Street numbers shall be illuminated so as to be legible, readable and visible at night from the street, which affords the principal means of access to the shopping center. The street numbers shall be situated on the sign so as to be unobstructed by landscaping or other objects. 
                  c.  A changeable copy board as defined in this article shall not be permitted on a shopping center freestanding sign, except in conformance with section 89-785(e). 
                  d.  No shopping center freestanding sign shall be located within 20 feet of the public right-of-way of the street which affords the principal means of access to the shopping center.

                  TABLE 7.4: MAXIMUM AREA OF A PRINCIPAL FREESTANDING SIGN  IN A SHOPPING CENTER 

                   
                  6  The copy area of a freestanding sign shall not include the shopping center identification and the street number. 
                  (4)  The owner or developer of a shopping center that exceeds 150,000 square feet may elect to forego one or more freestanding signs otherwise permitted under subsection 89-789(a)(2). For each sign that is foregone, the owner or developer may elect to increase the sign face area of one remaining sign up to 100 percent of the square footage that is otherwise permitted under subsection 89-789(a)(3). If there is more than one remaining sign, this percentage may be allocated among the remaining signs. In no event shall the sign face area of any remaining sign be increased by more than 100 percent. By way of illustration, if an owner of a shopping center exceeding 200,000 square feet elects to forego one of the four permitted signs, he might elect to increase the sign face area of one of the remaining signs by 100 percent, or he might elect to increase the sign face area of one remaining sign by 50 percent and the two other signs by 25 percent each, etc.

                  Sec. 89-791. - Billboards. 
                  (a)  Billboard; defined. A billboard is a freestanding sign that exceeds the sign area limitations established or otherwise approved for principal freestanding signs under section 89-788 of this article, and is not a principal freestanding sign authorized for a "shopping center" under section 89-789 or for an "office park" under section 89-890. 
                  (b)  Maximum number of billboards. 
                  (1)  The commission has considered the need for commercial and non-commercial speech through the medium of signs, in the unincorporated portions of the county. These interests must be weighed against the aesthetic and safety concerns that have been enumerated elsewhere in this article. After thorough consideration of these countervailing interests, the commission has developed the following regulations regarding the total number and structure of signs in the unincorporated portions of the county: 
                  a.  A total of 25 signs that are otherwise in conformance with the regulations found in this article shall be allowed in accordance with section 89-891(c), in the unincorporated portions of the county. 
                  b.  As a result of this section, once the number of signs within the unincorporated portions of the county reaches 25, no more permits for signs shall be issued. 
                  (2)  Removal and replacement. 
                  a.  The commission is aware that as the use of land changes, whether through condemnation, development, or redevelopment, certain billboard signs may need to be replaced or removed from the location where they were originally built. Whenever a billboard is removed, the owner of such removed sign shall be allowed to erect and operate a billboard at a permissible location as allowed by this section, if the owner makes application for such a permit within 12 months of the removal date. If the owner of a removed sign does not make application for another permit within 12 months, then other applications may be accepted for consideration by the building official. 
                  b.  Billboards that are not located at a permissible location as allowed by this section may not be replaced at the same location. 
                  (c)  Billboards; where allowed.

                  b.  No sign shall be located less than 1,000 feet from a national park, state park, local monument or church. 
                  c.  Distance measurement shall be made horizontally in all directions from the nearest edge of the sign face. 
                  (2)  Size of signs. Signs shall not exceed 90 feet in height nor be less than 15 feet above ground level. Sign faces shall not exceed 672 square feet or 48 feet in length, width, or height. 
                  (3)  Sign faces. No more than one single-faced or double-faced sign can be located on a single billboard sign structure. Only one sign module is allowed on a single-faced billboard sign structure, and only two sign modules are allowed on a double-faced billboard sign structure. The two sign modules forming a double-faced billboard must be parallel (back-to-back) to one another or form an interior angle no greater than 60 degrees, and the two sign modules may be separated from each other at their nearest point by no more than three feet. 
                  (4)  Sign orientation. Only one sign shall be allowed to face the same direction per location. This allows back-to-back or "V" formation signs, but prohibits two signs (side by side or one above the other) facing the same direction. 
                  (5)  Angle of the roadway. Billboards shall be placed at no more than a 20-degree angle from the roadway. 
                  (6)  Location on property. All portions of the billboard must be located on a property in accordance with the front, side and rear yard setback requirements of the zoning district in which it is located. 
                  (7)  D.O.T. regulations. The billboard must comply with all requirements of the State of Georgia and the Georgia Outdoor Advertising Act (O.C.G.A. § 32-6-70 et seq.), as well as the provisions of this section, whichever are the most restrictive.

However, a slope easement may be cleared and graded where required to prevent soil erosion upon approval of the director of planning; this easement may cover no more than 20 percent of the required zoning buffer area, and shall be immediately replanted upon completion of easement improvements. 
                  (b)  Width of zoning buffer. 
                  (1)  Zoning buffers required along any lot line shall be no less than the minimum required width as shown on Table 8.1. 
                  (2)  When a proposed development adjoins an existing development but the full width of the required zoning buffer does not exist, the new development shall provide a zoning buffer of adequate width to meet the full width required on Table 8.1 when considered in combination with any existing zoning buffer on the property of the adjoining development. 
                  (c)  Minimum required screening. Minimum required screening shall consist of a natural zoning buffer utilizing existing vegetation or a structural zoning buffer, whichever provides an opaque visual screen to a height of six feet, or any combination of existing and replanted vegetation which can reasonably be expected to create an opaque visual screen six feet high within two growing seasons. 
                  (d)  Natural zoning buffers. Natural zoning buffers may contain deciduous or perennial vegetation, but shall contain evergreen shrubs and trees suitable to local growing conditions that will provide an opaque visual screen during all seasons of the year. 
                  (e)  Structural zoning buffers. Structural zoning buffers shall meet the following criteria: 
                  (1)  Structural zoning buffers shall be vegetated throughout the minimum area required for the zoning buffer around any fences or walls and upon any earthen berms, which may include grass, ground covers, shrubs, and trees. 
                  (2)  All earthen berms shall have a maximum side slope of 50 percent (one foot of vertical rise to two feet of horizontal run). Earthen berms shall not be constructed within the drip line of any existing trees that will remain on the property. 
                  (3)  Trees shall be located or planted within any structural zoning buffer at a density of no less than one overstory tree for each 40 feet of zoning buffer length or portion thereof or one understory tree for each 20 feet. Overstory and understory trees may be combined using the appropriate density distance for each. New deciduous trees shall have a caliper of no less than two inches upon planting, and new evergreens shall be at least five feet tall when planted. Trees may be clustered for decorative effect following professional landscaping standards for spacing, location, and design. 
                  (4)  Fences and freestanding walls shall present a finished and decorative appearance to the abutting property, and shall be located no closer to the property line than two feet. 
                  (5)  Fences used in zoning buffers must be made of rot-resistant material or protected from deterioration with waterproofing material. 
                  (6)  The accompanying Figure 8.1 provides examples of natural and structural zoning buffers. Other solutions meeting the minimum requirements of this section are also acceptable.

                  Sec. 89-864. - Maintenance of zoning buffers. 
                  Every zoning buffer required by this article shall be maintained by the owner of the property where the zoning buffer is located, so as to provide an opaque visual screen to a height of six feet on a continuous, year-round basis. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 806) 
                  Sec. 89-865. - Zoning buffer modifications. 
                  (a)  Automatic reduction in zoning buffer width. If a structural zoning buffer is provided that creates an opaque screen to a height of no less than eight feet instead of six, the zoning buffer may be reduced to a width of no less than 75 percent of the zoning buffer width otherwise required. If the structural zoning buffer achieves a height of 12 feet or more, the zoning buffer width may be reduced to 50 percent of the width otherwise required. 
                  (b)  Location of zoning buffers. Zoning buffers may be relocated on the site to best achieve the screening required. 
                  (c)  Waiver for unnecessary zoning buffers. The board of commissioners may waive a zoning buffer requirement or reduce its extent to a temporarily appropriate level of screening if the comprehensive plan anticipates future development on the adjoining property in a land use category such that a zoning buffer would not be required by this Development Code once the adjoining property is rezoned or developed.

                  DIVISION 3. - TREE CONSERVATION 

                  Sec. 89-891. - Tree conservation; intent and findings. 
                  (a)  Intent. The intent of this division is to provide standards for the protection or replacement of trees as part of the land development and building construction process within Barrow County; to make the county an attractive place to live and to provide a healthy living environment; to better maintain control of stormwater runoff, noise, glare, and soil erosion; and to preserve, protect, and promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the public. 
                  (b)  Findings. 
                  (1)  Trees provide food and shelter for wildlife. 
                  (2)  Trees reduce noise, glare and provide wind breaks. 
                  (3)  Trees, through transpiration, purify the air. 
                  (4)  Trees intercept airborne particulate matter and reduce some air pollutants. 
                  (5)  Trees provide oxygen and reduce the level of carbon monoxide in the air. 
                  (6)  Trees are vital in erosion control, soil conservation, and the reduction in stormwater runoff. 
                  (7)  Trees moderate the climate. 
                  (8)  Trees increase property value. 
                  (9)  Trees provide aesthetic amenity. 
                  (10)  Trees improve the quality of water.

                  Sec. 89-892. - Tree conservation; where required. 
                  Tree conservation in accordance with the provisions of this division shall be applied to every activity that requires the issuance of a land disturbance permit under this Development Code, except for activities otherwise exempted by the provisions of this division. 
                  (1)  Application to new development or disturbed areas. 
                  a.  Residential subdivisions. 
                  1.  Residential subdivisions are exempt from the requirements of this division. 
                  2.  The owner/builder/contractor of each individual lot in a subdivision is responsible for compliance with the provisions of this division. 
                  b.  New commercial and industrial subdivisions. New commercial and industrial subdivisions are subject to a two-staged review process by the county (for the infrastructure and later for each individual lot). For this reason, these subdivisions may base density calculations on the net disturbed site area defined by the limits of clearance and construction. The phase 1 plan shall address the method and timing of ultimate compliance with this division. 
                  c.  Multi-family and nonresidential projects. Multi-family projects and office, commercial, institutional and industrial developments on individual sites are subject to the provisions of this division. 
                  d.  Nonresidential out-lots. Out-lots and separate parcels of a phased-unit development must collectively meet minimum requirements for site density; however, in no case may an individual out-lot have less than ten tree units per acre. 
                  e.  Additions to existing projects. For additions to existing projects, the density requirements may be met in one of the following ways: 
                  1.  Calculate the area of any new land disturbance and/or improvements and add replacement trees based on that area (existing trees elsewhere on the site may not be counted with this option); or 
                  2.  Base density requirements on the total site area and count any existing trees on the site (subject to the restrictions of the next section). 
                  f.  Phased projects and reduced net site areas. 
                  1.  Where development is going to occur in phases (by design or by implication), density calculations must be based on a site area defined by an established or estimated phase line. 
                  2.  Similarly, a reduced net site area may be achieved by using only the area of actual site disturbance (new projects only), provided that limits of construction line is clearly shown on the plan (existing trees elsewhere on the site may not be counted with this option). 
                  3.  In both instances, the following criteria are applied regarding existing trees: 
                  i.  Existing trees to be counted toward meeting the density requirements should be within the phase line or limits of construction. 
                  ii.  If the tree save areas must be established outside these areas, they must be located where future development will not impact them. 
                  iii.  The trees in areas outside the phase line or limits of construction may not be counted toward the density requirement of subsequent phases or new projects. 
                  (2)  Exemptions from tree conservation requirements. The tree conservation requirements shall not apply to the following: 
                  a.  Residential subdivisions. 
                  b.  Public utility companies and government agencies conducting operations on public and utility rights-of-way and easements or on sites for electric power substations and similar facilities, which operations are for the purpose of assuring uninterrupted utility and governmental services and unobstructed passage on public streets. 
                  c.  Agricultural activities. 
                  1.  Property in use for agricultural tree harvesting (as defined by this Development Code) or other agricultural activities (as defined by this Development Code), provided that the timber harvesting notice requirements of this Development Code and the requirements of state law and regulations regarding tree harvesting are met. 
                  2.  If a property is systematically thinned of trees or is clear-cut for any purpose other than a bona fide agricultural use, or the timber is harvested without complying with the requirements of this Development Code and state law, a preliminary plat or project site plan for development of the property may not be approved for a period of five years. This restriction may only be waived by the board of commissioners by majority vote. Such waiver may be based on a valid excuse for the clear-cutting, or on remedial action such as the replanting of trees. 
                  (3)  Clearing and/or grading only permits. 
                  a.  When seeking a limited land disturbance permit (i.e. clearing, clearing and grading, or grading only), it is necessary for applicants to show compliance with the required site density factor. 
                  b.  If trees exist on the site, the required density should be met with those trees. If this cannot be done, replacement trees are required. A replacement tree plan must be a part of the approved clearing and/or grading plan unless documentation is submitted to the county indicating that application for a full land disturbance permit will be made within one year of the grading plan approval date. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 809; Ord. of 8-9-2016, § 3) 
                  Sec. 89-893. - Calculation of "tree units". 
                  (a)  Use of tree units. The landscaping requirements of this article with regard to the preservation or planting of trees is expressed in terms of "tree units" rather than the number of trees. This approach provides the developer with wide latitude of choice as to the number and sizes of trees to be planted, and their distribution following aesthetic landscaping practices, while achieving a common standard on all properties. 
                  Table 8.2: Tree Unit Values 

                   
                  The unit value for an individual tree over 20 inches DBH shall be calculated as follows: 

                   
                  * See text for increased tree unit values for specimen trees for which extraordinary measures for protection and survival have been taken. 
                  Tree unit values for container grown pine are: 

                   
                  The use of 3 gallon pines requires specific approval in writing by the county. 
                  (b)  Establishment of tree unit values. The diameter of a tree's trunk establishes the "tree unit" value of an existing tree, as shown on Table 8.2. 
                  (1)  The values assigned to trees of the same size are different for existing and new trees, as indicated in the table. One "unit" is not the same as one "tree". 
                  (2)  Actual tree diameters or calipers are to be rounded to the nearest whole number for the calculation of tree unit values (e.g., 4.5 = 5). 
                  (3)  The tree unit value for an existing tree greater than 20 inches DBH shall be determined by dividing the square of the tree's diameter at breast height by 100 (Diameter 2 ° 100). 
                  (c)  Tree unit values for specimen trees. The tree unit values shown on Table 8.2 may be increased by 100 percent for an existing tree that meets the definition of a "specimen tree", provided that extraordinary measures are taken to protect the tree and assure its survival. Such measures may include but are not limited to the provision of tree wells, retaining walls, aeration, or supplementary irrigation, as applicable to the site of the tree and as approved by the county. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 810) 
                  Sec. 89-894. - Trees to be provided or retained. 
                  (a)  Number of tree units upon completion of development. 
                  (1)  Tree units required. Upon completion of development, all residential subdivisions and developments, and all multi-family or nonresidential uses or development projects, shall have a number of tree units per acre of development site or disturbed area, whichever is less, as shown on Table 8.3. The limits of grading activity shall establish the extent of land disturbance, except for those areas excluded under this section. 
                  Table 8.3: Tree Units Required Upon Completion 

                   
                  * >Per acre of development site or disturbed area, whichever is less, but not including excluded areas. 
                  (2)  Excluded areas. The calculation of development site or disturbed area shall exclude any area within a stream buffer or zoning buffer required by this article, and any area contained within a utility easement, wetland or area of special flood hazard. Neither the land area of these excluded areas, nor the trees that are or will be located within them, count toward the number of tree units required on or provided for the site. 
                  (3)  Trees meeting tree unit requirements. All trees planted or retained on the site, except for trees planted or retained within an excluded area as defined under this section, shall be counted toward the minimum tree units required by Table 8.3 on the site in accordance with the values shown on Table 8.2. 
                  (b)  Tree inventories and surveys. 
                  (1)  All trees that are to be counted toward meeting density requirements must be inventoried. Trees in excluded areas need not be inventoried. 
                  (2)  Sampling methods may be used to determine tree densities for forested areas greater than two acres in extent, subject to prior approval of the county. 
                  (3)  Specimen trees must be shown on the plan with an indication whether they are to be retained or removed. Accurate locations are requested when the preservation of a specimen tree is questionable, or when a site design alteration is required by the county. Approximate locations are acceptable otherwise. 
                  (c)  Specimen trees. 
                  (1)  Preservation. 
                  a.  Barrow County strongly advocates the preservation of specimen trees. In order to encourage the preservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, additional density credit will be given for specimen trees that are successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose. Credit for any specimen tree thus saved would be two times the assigned unit value shown in Table 8.2 when using the extraordinary measures associated with protecting and assuring the survival of such trees. 
                  b.  When the critical root zone of a specimen tree located off-site may be affected by proposed construction activities, tree protection devices are to be installed around the critical root zone of the specimen tree on the property under construction. Location of these off-site specimen trees will be determined by the county. 
                  (2)  Removal and replacement. 
                  a.  If a specimen tree is to be removed, a plan or written documentation indicating the reason for the removal must be submitted to and approved by the county. 
                  b.  When permission is received to remove a specimen tree, it must be replaced on an inch-by-inch basis by minimum two-inch caliper trees that have potential for comparable size and quality. For example, the removal of a 30-inch DBH tree would require replacement of 15 two-inch caliper trees or ten three-inch caliper trees of a comparable species. This tree replacement is in addition to the minimum site tree density. 
                  c.  Any specimen tree that is removed without the appropriate review and approval of the county must be replaced by trees with a total density equal to two times the unit value of the tree removed. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is no evidence of its condition. 
                  (d)  Tree replacement standards. 
                  (1)  Introduction. 
                  a.  The following section establishes standards by which plans and field conditions are to be evaluated to determine compliance with the tree replacement intent of this Development Code. 
                  b.  Tree replacement plans should be prepared with appropriate consideration given to the function of trees in the urban landscape. Every effort should be made to maximize the environmental benefit of the plant material. 
                  (2)  Planting specifications. 
                  a.  Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects, and must be of good vigor in order to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability. 
                  b.  Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established in the International Society of Arboriculture publication "Tree and Shrub Transplanting Manual" or similar publication. Reference may also be made to the American Association of Nurserymen publication "American Standard for Nursery Stock" (ANS1260.1, 1996 or latest edition) for plant material quality specifications. Reference may also be made to the Manual of Woody Landscape Plants (Michael Dirr, 1983, Castle Books) or similar publication for information on tree species site requirements. 
                  c.  All balled and burlapped trees shall be dug with a mechanical tree spade in a wire basket with minimum one-inch nylon strapping. 
                  (3)  Species. 
                  a.  Species selected as replacement trees must be quality specimens, and must be ecologically compatible with the intended growing site. To insure diversity, a minimum of four species of tree shall be used. Sites requiring limited replacement shall be evaluated by the county to allow use of fewer species. 
                  b.  Flowering ornamental species are typically not acceptable for use in meeting density requirements. 
                  c.  Where trees must be added to achieve the required tree units per acre for the site, pines may not comprise more than 50 percent of the required units. Where existing pines already comprise 50 percent or more of the required units, no more pines may be credited toward the required units. 
                  d.  Trees shall only be awarded credit toward the required tree units on the site when situated in areas where they may grow to mature height without pruning. 
                  (4)  Minimum root zones. In order to provide sufficient growing area for planted trees, the following minimum criteria must be observed unless otherwise approved by the county: 
                  a.  Overstory trees—160 sq. ft. of pervious root zone. 
                  b.  Understory trees—100 sq. ft. of pervious root zone. 
                  c.  All planting strips—Five ft. minimum width. 
                  (5)  Irrigation. Newly planted trees and existing trees subjected to construction impacts typically need supplemental watering when rainfall is inadequate. Applicants should be prepared to discuss how trees are to be watered during their establishment or transition period, and shall note on the plan the method of irrigation that is proposed and attendant facilities. For hand watering, for instance, the location of hose bibs must be indicated; automatic systems require a back flow preventer approved by the county. 
                  (6)  Public street rights-of-way. Trees shall not be planted within any public street right-of-way. 
                  (7)  Placement of trees. The replacement trees on a property shall be placed reasonably uniformly throughout the disturbed area, subject to professional standards of design. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 811; Ord. of 10-9-2012, § 4; Ord. of 4-11-2017, § 4) 
                  Sec. 89-895. - Protection of existing trees. 
                  For existing trees that are proposed to be retained in order to meet the minimum requirements of this Development Code, the following provisions shall apply; 
                  (1)  Damage prohibited. No person shall: 
                  a.  Cut, carve, or otherwise damage or remove any tree except in accordance with the provisions of this Development Code. 
                  b.  Attach any wire, nails, advertising posters, or other contrivance harmful to any tree. 
                  c.  Allow any gaseous, liquid, or solid substance which is harmful to trees (such as concrete washout, fuel, lubricants, herbicides, paint) to come in contact with them. 
                  d.  Set a fire or permit any fire to burn when such fire or the heat thereof will injure any portion of any tree. 
                  (2)  Construction standards. 
                  a.  Purpose of tree protection devices. Tree protection devices are necessary to eliminate activities detrimental to trees including but not limited to: 
                  1.  Soil compaction in the critical root zone resulting from heavy equipment, vehicular or excessive pedestrian traffic, or storage of equipment or materials; 
                  2.  Root disturbance due to cuts, fills or trenching; 
                  3.  Wounds to exposed roots, trunks or limbs by mechanical equipment; and 
                  4.  Other activities such as chemical storage, cement truck cleaning, fire, etc. 
                  b.  Location and types of tree protection devices. 
                  1.  Tree protection devices are to be installed as shown on the plan or otherwise completely surrounding the critical root zone. 
                  2.  The plan shall indicate whether the tree protection device is to be active or passive; 
                  3.  Active protection (see materials section below) is required where tree save areas are located in proximity to construction activity. 
                  4.  The locations of all tree protection devices will be verified prior to the issuance of the construction permit for clearing and/or grading. 
                  5.  Once protected zones are established and approved, any changes are subject to county review. 
                  c.  Materials. Active tree protection shall consist of chain link, orange laminated plastic, wooden post and rail fencing or other equivalent restraining material meeting county standards. 
                  d.  Sequence of installation and removal. All tree protection devices shall be installed prior to any clearing, grubbing or grading. The county must inspect the installation of tree protection and erosion and sedimentation control devices prior to the issuance of the construction permit. Tree protection must remain in functioning condition throughout all phases of development, but is to be removed prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
                  e.  Other specifications. 
                  1.  Clearing. Where clearing has been approved, trees shall be removed in a manner which does not adversely impact the trees to be preserved. Avoid felling trees into protection zones or disturbing roots inside the protection zones. Roots shall be cut cleanly before tree removal. 
                  2.  Erosion and sedimentation control. All erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be installed in a manner which will not result in the accumulation of sediment in a tree protection zone. 
                  3.  Signage. All tree protection zones shall be designated as such with "tree save area" signs posted visibly on all sides of the fenced-in area. These signs are intended to inform subcontractors of the tree protection process. 
                  4.  Signs requiring subcontractor cooperation and compliance with the tree protection standards shall be posted at site entrances. 
                  (3)  Prohibited activities. 
                  a.  Compaction prohibited. All building materials, vehicles, construction equipment, dirt, debris, or other objects likely to cause soil compaction or above-ground damage shall be kept outside the critical root zone. Where a limited amount of encroachment is unavoidable, the critical root zone shall first be cut cleanly, then immediately mulched with a four-inch layer of processed bark or wood chips or a six-inch layer of straw. 
                  b.  Grade change prohibited. There shall be no raising or lowering of the ground level within the critical root zone. Stripping of topsoil in the critical root zone shall not be permitted. Where necessary, the use of moderate fill is permitted only with prior installation of an aeration system. Deposition of sediment in the critical root zone shall be prevented by placement of sediment barriers, which shall be backed by two- by four-inch wire mesh in areas of steep slope. 
                  c.  Ditches prohibited. No person shall excavate any ditch or trench within the critical root zone. Where such encroachment is unavoidable, ditches or trenches shall be so located as to minimize root damage. If roots must be cut, they must be cut cleanly and immediately mulched. 
                  d.  Paving prohibited. No person shall pave with concrete, asphalt, or other impervious material within the critical root zone.

                  Sec. 89-896. - Alternative compliance. 
                  (a)  Overview. The intent of the tree conservation provisions of this Development Code is to insure that a minimum density of trees is maintained on all developed sites. Occasionally, this intent cannot be met because a project site will not bear the required density of trees. To provide a viable alternative for such cases, the developer may be allowed to plant trees at his own expense on an alternate property in lieu of over-planting the development site. 
                  (b)  Alternate tree plantings. 
                  (1)  The county must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall 100 percent of the required tree units be met through alternative compliance. As many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the development site. 
                  (2)  Public properties, such as school sites, parks, fire stations and other publicly owned sites, will be given priority for alternate tree plantings. 
                  (3)  Tree planting on alternate compliance properties shall be done simultaneously with the planting of trees on the development site such that inspections and final approval for the project will include trees planted on the alternate property. 
                  (4)  The land disturbance permit for the development site will only be issued after the county has approved the alternate compliance request and the property designated to receive the alternate plantings.

                  This article sets out the minimum requirements and standards for the protection of the natural environment within the county, including restrictions on the use of land near certain rivers and streams, within water supply watersheds, within groundwater recharge areas susceptible to pollution, and in wetlands in order to: 
                  (1)  Protect the drinking water quality of the rivers, streams, reservoirs and aquifers that supply water to the residents of the jurisdiction and the state; 
                  (2)  Protect the natural habitat of animal and plant life relative to water resources; and 
                  (3)  Protect valuable water-related and other natural resources, to help control erosion and river sedimentation, for contribution to drought management, and to help absorb floodwaters.

                  Perennial stream: A stream that flows throughout the whole year. Perennial streams may be identified as shown as such on a United States Geologic Service Quad Map. 
                  Pollution susceptibility: The relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in a recharge area. 
                  Perennial river: A river or section of a river that flows continuously throughout the year. 
                  Protected state river: Any perennial river or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second as determined by appropriate U.S. Geological Survey documents. In the county, the protected state rivers are the Middle Oconee River, the Mulberry River and the Apalachee River. 
                  Public utility: A service provided by a public utility company or a private entity that provides such service, including all equipment and structures necessary to provide such services. 
                  Recharge area: Any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
                  Regulated stream: A natural, free-flowing watercourse that meets certain criteria as established within the environmental protection article of this Development Code. 
                  River: A natural, free-flowing watercourse that is typically of greater volume than a stream or creek. See also "state protected river". 
                  River bank: The rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
                  River corridor: All land, including islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act, O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-440 et seq., or the Coastal Marshland Protection Act, O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-280—12-5-293, in areas of a protected river and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. The 100-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the riverbank, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured 100-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by the county in the same manner as the river corridor. Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, riverbank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purpose of this article, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for the local comprehensive plan as established by the state department of community affairs. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the start of the review period will require a revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next review by the department of community affairs. 
                  River corridor protection plan: That part of the county comprehensive plan that deals with river corridor protection as required by the Georgia Planning Act of 1989, O.C.G.A. §§ 36-70-1 et seq. 
                  Sensitive natural area: Any area, as identified by the state department of natural resources, which contains one or more of the following: 
                  (1)  Habitat, including nesting sites, occupied by rare or endangered species; 
                  (2)  Rare or exemplary natural communities; 
                  (3)  Significant land forms, hydroforms, or geological features; or 
                  (4)  Other areas so designated by the department of natural resources, and which are sensitive or vulnerable to physical or biological alteration. 
                  Significant recharge area: Those areas mapped by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 Edition). 
                  State waters: Any and all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage systems, springs, wells and other bodies of surface or subsurface water, natural or artificial, lying within or forming a part of the boundaries of the state which are not entirely confined and retained completely upon the property of a single individual, partnership or corporation. 
                  Stream: A natural, free-flowing watercourse with either constant or intermittent flow of moderate volume typically less than that of a river. 
                  Stream bank: The confining cut of a stream channel and is usually identified as the point where the normal stream flow has wrested the vegetation. For non-trout waters, the normal stream flow is any stream flow that consists solely of base flow or consists of both base flow and direct runoff during any period of the year. Base flow results from groundwater that enters the stream channel through the soil. This includes spring flows into streams. Direct runoff is the water entering stream channels promptly after rainfalls or snow melts. 
                  Stream buffer: A strip of natural indigenous vegetation adjacent and parallel to the bank of a regulated stream designed to preserve and improve the quality of water within the regulated stream and its watershed. 
                  Stream, regulated: See "regulated stream". 
                  Water quality critical area: The water quality critical area for each water supply watershed shall comprise all lands within the respective water supply watershed districts within seven miles upstream from the public water supply intakes or the boundary of a public water supply reservoir. 
                  Watershed: The total area of land that is drained by a river or stream and its tributaries. 
                  Water supply reservoir: A governmentally owned impoundment of water for the primary purpose of providing water to one or more governmentally owned drinking water systems. This definition specifically excludes the multipurpose reservoirs owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Water supply watershed: The area upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake or reservoir boundary. 
                  Wetlands: Areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. 
                  Wetlands, jurisdictional: An area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

                  (b)  Criteria for regulated streams. All watercourses that appear as a solid or broken line on the U.S.G.S. Quadrangle Maps shall be regulated streams. Other natural watercourses may be classified as regulated streams if they possess one or more of the following characteristics, as determined by the planning director based on data analysis and/or field review: 
                  (1)  Evidence of significant water flow along the channel or bed of the watercourse, characterized by one or more of the following: hydraulically sorted sediments; wrested vegetation and vegetative litter due to normal stream flow; and loosely rooted vegetation caused by the action of moving water. 
                  (2)  Evidence of hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, or wetlands in or around the channel or bed of the watercourse.

                  (3)  Permits shall be valid for six months. If the activity has not been completed but substantial progress has been made, one six-month extension to the permit may be granted by the planning department. 
                  (4)  Permits may be revoked for failure to comply with regulatory guidelines, including conditions attached to the permit. 
                  (b)  Appeals. A variance may be approved if such approval is not contrary to the public interest and where because of a special characteristic of the property and the activity, a literal enforcement of provisions of this Development Code will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship. Appeal procedures are detailed under the appeals article of this Development Code. 
                  (c)  Existing industrial and commercial land uses. Industrial and commercial land uses existing prior to the effective date of this Development Code are exempt from the protection criteria of this Development Code, except as specifically prohibited under this article, provided that: 
                  (1)  The use of the river corridor does not impair the drinking quality of the river water; and

                  c.  Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the stream buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller stream buffer shall be granted. 
                  (c)  Other protected streams and state waters. For all regulated streams and other state waters other than the Apalachee, Mulberry and Middle Oconee Rivers, the following shall apply: 
                  (1)  Watershed protection areas. All perennial streams within watershed protection areas must comply with the natural stream buffer and setback requirements established for streams in each watershed. (See Division 3 of this article.) 
                  (2)  Other streams and waters. For regulated streams and other state waters for which there are no stream buffers or setback restrictions otherwise established by this article, there shall be no land disturbing activities within a 25-foot wide stream buffer extending outward from both of the stream banks as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, other than drainage structures and roads allowed under a development permit. 
                  (d)  Recordation of restrictions. Restrictions shall be noted on the plats and deeds of included properties to maintain any designated natural stream buffer area, undisturbed area or construction setback required by this article. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 906; Ord. of 10-25-2005, § 19, Exh. A) 
                  Sec. 89-971. - Stream buffers. 
                  Unless more restrictive requirements under this Development Code apply, all perennial streams and other state waters shall be provided with a natural vegetative stream buffer as follows: 
                  (1)  Minimum width of stream buffer. 
                  a.  The minimum stream buffer width must be provided along any protected state river or trout stream as required under subsections 89-970(a) and (b), respectively; 
                  b.  The minimum stream buffer width must be provided along any protected stream within any water supply watershed and around any water supply reservoir, as required under sections 89-998 through 89-1000 in this article. 
                  c.  For all other perennial streams and state waters, the stream buffer is to be established under subsection 89-970(c)(2). 
                  (2)  Minimum setback for land disturbance. All clearing, earth moving, construction and ground disturbance must remain at least 50 feet from the edge of any stream buffer within a water quality critical area. Exceptions include bike and footpaths constructed of permeable material, gravity sanitary sewers, and road crossings perpendicular to streams. The installation of storm sewers will also be allowed. The area that is within this restricted construction area is to be left natural or developed as a trail with a minimum of disturbance to the natural habitat. 
                  (3)  Protection of stream buffers. 
                  a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a stream buffer and a stream buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Land disturbing activities may only be allowed as follows: 
                  1.  Where the EPD director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment; or 
                  2.  Where otherwise allowed by the EPD director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8; or 
                  3.  Where a drainage structure or a roadway structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented; provided, however, that stream buffers of at least 50 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the EPD director. 
                  b.  A stream buffer is to be included within a conservation or natural resources easement that meets the requirements of this article. 
                  c.  All stream buffer areas shall be maintained with appropriate indigenous plant species for the maintenance of groundcover and limitation of erosion. Undisturbed natural vegetation is the preferred, optimum state of a stream buffer. In the alternate, careful reestablishment of indigenous vegetation and ground cover is encouraged. 
                  d.  Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a stream buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation, consistent with the terms of any applicable conservation or natural resources easement, as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed. 
                  e.  Any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a stream buffer at any time, consistent with the terms of any applicable conservation or natural resources easement, as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed.

                  Sec. 89-1052. - Permitting requirements. 
                  (a)  Requirement for local permit. 
                  (1)  No land disturbing activity will be permitted within protected wetlands without written permission in the form of a local development permit from the county. 
                  (2)  If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands boundary, as determined using the National Wetlands Inventory Map, no land disturbance permit will be issued by the county until a Section 404 Permit or letter of permission is issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers if the wetlands area falls under Corps jurisdiction. 
                  (3)  Issuance of a development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. 
                  (4)  All activities that are not allowed in this Development Code shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a development permit. 
                  (b)  Section 404 Permits; when required. 
                  (1)  If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a protected wetland boundary, as determined from the NWI Map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall also be required. 
                  (2)  If the Corps determines that jurisdictional wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a Section 404 Permit or letter of permission is required, a development permit will be issued only following issuance of the Section 404 Permit or letter of permission. 
                  (c)  Conservation easement required. Any protected wetlands area that will be retained in any subdivision or development project is to be included within a conservation or natural resources easement that meets the requirements of this article.

                  Sec. 89-1070. - Purposes of natural resource conservation. 
                  The purposes of this division, among others, are as follows: 
                  (1)  To recognize the current development rights of property owners established through zoning; 
                  (2)  To conserve open land, including those areas containing unique and sensitive natural features such as stream buffers, floodplains, and wetlands, by setting them aside from development; 
                  (3)  To support the continued viability of agricultural activities in the county, including crop production, dairying and managed forestry; 
                  (4)  To reduce erosion and sedimentation by the retention of existing vegetation and to encourage minimization of development on steep slopes; 
                  (5)  To enhance water quality of streams and waterways, and to protect valuable groundwater resources; 
                  (6)  To encourage conservation of scenic views and elements of the county's rural character, and to minimize perceived density by minimizing views of new development from existing roads; and 
                  (7)  To provide notification to property owners of natural resources that must be protected on their property. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 922; Ord. of 10-25-2005, § 19, Exh. A) 
                  Sec. 89-1071. - Designation of conservation areas. 
                  (a)  Primary conservation areas. Primary conservation areas are defined as follows: 
                  (1)  River and stream channels. These areas are defined as the area between the top of bank and the opposite top of bank of any river, stream or other body of water classified as "state waters". 
                  (2)  Required river and stream buffers. Natural vegetative stream buffers along the banks of all protected state rivers and perennial streams and other state waters, as required by this article (except for activities that are exempt from the soil erosion and sedimentation control provisions of the Land Development Activities Article of this Development Code). 
                  (3)  Wildlife habitats of threatened or endangered species. The animal and plant species listed on Table 9.2 have been identified by the federal and/or the state governments as threatened or endangered species in Barrow County. 
                  (4)  Protected wetlands. Wetlands are illustrated generally on the National Wetlands Inventory Maps published by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and as otherwise delineated by the U.S. Corps of Engineers. 
                  Table 9.2. Threatened or Endangered Species Identified in Barrow County 

                   
                  Source: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
                  (5)  Buffer areas around wetlands and habitats of endangered species. Additional lands in their natural state provided around designated wetlands and critical wildlife habitats as protective buffers are recognized as primary conservation areas. To qualify, a wetland buffer must extend at least 25 feet from the wetland, and a buffer around a wildlife habitat must be at least 100 feet deep. 
                  (6)  100-year floodplain. All areas within the 100-year floodplain but lying outside any wetland or other designated primary conservation area fall under this category. The boundaries of the 100-year floodplain are designated as the "flood hazard area" on maps prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and must be confirmed as to their specific location by the design professional. 
                  (b)  Secondary conservation areas. Secondary conservation areas are areas that are encouraged (but not required) to be protected. These include: 
                  (1)  Areas greater than 5,000 square feet of steep slopes over 25 percent. Slopes greater than 25 percent can be identified from the topographic data required for the preliminary plat or site plan for a development. Areas comprising 5,000 contiguous square feet or less are not considered secondary conservation areas. 
                  (2)  Areas greater than 40,000 square feet with slopes of 15 percent to 25 percent. Slopes between 15 percent and 25 percent can be identified from the topographic data required for the preliminary plat or site plan for a development. Areas comprising 40,000 contiguous square feet or less are not considered secondary conservation areas. 
                  (3)  Soils with exposed bedrock or rock outcroppings greater than 40,000 sf. Areas with exposed bedrock or rock outcroppings must be identified through observation on each site. Areas comprising 40,000 contiguous square feet or less are not considered secondary conservation areas. 
                  (4)  Mature timber stands or significant trees. Forests and timberlands that have mature stands of trees qualify for conservation consideration. Individual trees that are specimen trees or otherwise have significance through their size, age, species or historic value may be designated as a secondary conservation area to the extent of the tree's dripline. See Article VIII, Buffers and Tree Conservation. 
                  (5)  Registered historic or archeological assets. Sites or areas registered with the state or the National Register of Historic Places qualify under this category since preservation is desirable but not mandated by law. Information regarding all such sites is available from the Georgia Office of Historic Preservation. 
                  (6)  Viewshed protection areas. These areas may be set aside either to screen the view of the development from abutting roadways or to protect existing scenic views into the development site of rural heritage features. Examples of rural heritage features include the following: 
                  Table 9.333. Rural Heritage Features 

                   
                  If intended to screen the subdivision development, the viewshed buffer must be adequately vegetated with trees and understory growth to provide an opaque screening effect. If intended to preserve a scenic view, the viewshed protection area must provide an adequate width or orientation in order to preserve the view. 
                  (7)  Village greens, parkways. These areas create neighborhood assets by providing open space and passive recreation close to the homes in a subdivision. A village green is an open space area surrounded by streets and/or building lots on at least three sides, and intended for common neighborhood use. A parkway is a narrow strip of open space surrounded by streets on all sides, intended as a landscaped element or passive recreation area for the neighborhood. 
                  (8)  Passive recreational areas. Common open space areas solely designated and improved for passive recreational activities, such as picnicking, walking, relaxation and repose, may be treated as secondary conservation areas. Active recreation areas, including but not limited to golf courses, swimming pools, sports fields and courts, and community buildings and grounds are not considered secondary conservation areas. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 923; Ord. of 10-25-2005, § 19, Exh. A) 
                  Sec. 89-1072. - Allowed uses in natural conservation areas. 
                  The following requirements apply only to land set aside for conservation in fulfillment of the provisions of this article: 
                  (1)  Undisturbed areas. Certain areas identified as primary or secondary conservation areas shall remain in their natural, undisturbed state. Such undisturbed areas include river and stream channels, stream buffers, viewshed buffers, critical wildlife habitats and buffers, wetlands and wetland buffers, and mature timber stands (except for managed forestry activities, including harvesting). 
                  (2)  Allowed uses in other conservation areas. The following uses are allowed in natural resource conservation areas to the extent that they are compatible with the protection and preservation of areas required by law but not otherwise required to remain undisturbed, and are allowed uses under the site's zoning classification: 
                  a.  Conservation of open land in its natural state (for example, woodland, open field, or managed meadow). 
                  b.  Agricultural and horticultural uses, including raising crops, pasturelands and dairy operations, along with associated buildings (including residences) that are specifically needed to support an active, viable agricultural or horticultural operation. Specifically excluded are commercial livestock operations involving swine or poultry. 
                  c.  Pastureland for horses used solely for recreational purposes. Equestrian facility buildings and grounds shall be permitted but may not be located in any primary conservation area. 
                  d.  Silviculture, in keeping with established standards for selective harvesting and sustained yield forestry, and best management practices endorsed by the Georgia Forestry Commission. 
                  e.  Neighborhood open space uses such as village greens, commons, picnic areas, community gardens, trails, and similar low-impact passive recreational uses specifically excluding motorized off-road vehicles, rifle ranges, golf courses, sports fields and courts, community recreation buildings and grounds, swimming pools, and other active recreation uses. 
                  f.  Pathways and trails, and passive recreation activities such as fishing, picnicking, and nature interpretation. 
                  g.  Water supply, sewage disposal system reserve fields and stormwater detention areas designed, landscaped, and available for use as an integral part of the conservation area. The septic tank and drain field required for on-site sewage disposal must be located on the lot of the house it serves. Areas within a conservation area used for water supply, backup drainfields or stormwater detention must be located outside of any primary conservation area, and must be established by easements between the appropriate parties and recognized in the conservation easement covering the area. 
                  h.  Easements for drainage, access, power, natural gas, sewer or water lines, or other public purposes, as approved by the public works director and in keeping with conservation of the areas they traverse.

                  a.  Accelerated erosion. 
                  b.  Pollution, contamination, or siltation of lakes, rivers streams, and other water bodies. 
                  c.  Damage to vegetation. 
                  d.  Injury to wildlife and fish habitats. 
                  (2)  Development shall be planned, designed, constructed and maintained to provide open space and to create a man-made environment for human use or occupancy compatible and harmonious with the natural environment and specific consideration shall be given to the preservation of natural topography, to preservation of existing vegetation, to retention of major land forms and to preservation of important vistas. 
                  (c)  Conformance to the comprehensive plan and other adopted plans. In addition to the requirements established herein, all subdivisions and individual development projects shall comply with the following laws, rules and regulations: 
                  (1)  All proposed subdivisions and individual development projects shall conform to the comprehensive plan and development policies in effect at the time of submission to the planning department. 
                  (2)  All highways, major thoroughfares, streets and other transportation facilities shall be platted by the developer in the location and to the dimension indicated on the comprehensive plan or the transportation plan, whichever is the most recently adopted or amended. 
                  (3)  When features of the comprehensive plan or other plans adopted by the board of commissioners (such as schools or other public building sites, parks or other land for public uses) are located in whole or in part in a subdivision, such features shall be either dedicated or reserved by the subdivider for acquisition within a reasonable time by the appropriate public agency. 
                  a.  Whenever a plat or site plan proposes the dedication of land to public use that the planning director finds not required or suitable for such public use, the planning director shall refuse to approve the plat or site plan. The director's opinion may be appealed to the board of commissioners. 
                  b.  Whenever a plat or site plan proposes the dedication of land to public use that the board of commissioners finds to be not required or suitable for such public use, the board of commissioners shall refuse to accept the dedication. 
                  (4)  In subdivisions or developments related to or affecting any state or U.S. numbered highway, the planning department shall require the approval of the Georgia Department of Transportation. 
                  (5)  Any and all rules of the county health department, the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service (formerly the Soil Conservation Service), and all other appropriate state and federal agencies. 
                  (d)  Name of subdivision or development project. The name of each subdivision or development project must have the approval of the planning department. The name shall not duplicate nor closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision or development project in Barrow County or any of its cities. 
                  (1)  Street names. 
                  a.  Proposed streets obviously in alignment with other existing and named streets shall bear the names of the existing streets. In no case shall the name for a proposed street duplicate existing street names in Barrow County or any of its cities, irrespective of the use of a suffix such as: street, avenue, boulevard, road, pike, drive, way, place, court or other derivatives. In the same development, the root name may reoccur four times. 
                  b.  Root names shall consist of no more than 20 characters including spaces and punctuation marks. 
                  (2)  Approval of street names for new subdivisions. All new subdivision streets must have proposed street names viewed and approved. New street names must be shown on the final plat and recorded as such. To obtain approval of a proposed street name, you must submit a list of names to the GIS department before steps are taken to receive a development permit or before using on any plats or documents. Names will be reviewed against established criteria. If acceptable, they will be placed on a "reserved list". If disapproved, you will be given an explanation of the disapproval. Street names will be verified on both preliminary and final plats to make sure that no changes have taken place. Once the final plat is recorded, street names become permanent and are so noted on all records. 
                  (3)  Approval of subdivision names for new subdivision. As with new street names, new subdivision names must also be reviewed and approved. Names must be submitted to GIS before steps are taken to acquire a development permit or before using on any plat or document. Names will be reviewed against established criteria and if acceptable, will be placed on a "reserved list". Once the final plat is recorded, subdivision names become permanent and are so noted on all records. 
                  (4)  Street addresses. 
                  a.  All developments, commercial or residential, must be assigned a street address after the issuing of a septic permit and building permit. This gives confirmation that the lot is buildable. 
                  b.  All new subdivisions are assigned addresses right before final plat approval. Environmental health signature is required on the plat before addresses are issued. Submit two copies of the plat to the GIS department for assignment of addresses. 
                  (e)  Alleys. Alleys shall only be allowed as an intrinsic element of a particular development design, such as providing access to rear-entry garages in a subdivision, and must be approved as part of the project approval process contained in the Procedures and Permits Article of this Development Code. 
                  (f)  Blocks. 
                  (1)  Design guidelines. The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with regard to: 
                  a.  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated. 
                  b.  Zoning requirements as to lot size and dimensions. 
                  c.  Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic. 
                  d.  Limitations and opportunities of topography. 
                  (2)  Length. 
                  a.  Unless otherwise approved by the planning director under unusual circumstances, block lengths shall not exceed 1,200 feet nor be less than 400 feet in length. 
                  b.  In blocks greater than 1,200 feet in length, the planning director may require one or more public easements of not less than 20 feet in width to extend entirely across the block for pedestrian crosswalks, fire protection or utilities. 
                  c.  Width: Blocks shall be wide enough to allow two rows of lots, except as follows: 
                  1.  Where reverse frontage lots on major thoroughfares are provided, or where abutting upon limited access highways or railroads; 
                  2.  When prevented by topographic conditions or size of the property; 
                  3.  Lots along the periphery of the subdivision; or 
                  4.  Other situations make this requirement impractical, in which case the planning director may approve a single row of lots. 
                  (3)  Nonresidential blocks. Blocks for other than residential use shall be of such length and width as may be suitable for the prospective use, including adequate provision for off-street parking and service. 
                  (g)  Lots. The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation, and the minimum building setback lines shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated and meet all the area and dimensional requirements of this Development Code for the zoning district in which the lots are located. 
                  (1)  Adequate building sites. Each lot shall contain a site large enough for a normal building that will meet all building setback requirements as set forth in this Development Code and not be subject to flood or periodic inundation 
                  (2)  Arrangement. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines (including cul-de-sacs). 
                  (3)  Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently large to permit the location of buildings so as to conform to the front building setback lines on both streets. 
                  (4)  Through (double-frontage) lots. 
                  a.  Except where specifically required to provide reverse frontage separation from a county road or a state or U.S. numbered highway, or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation of property, through lots (i.e., "double-frontage" lots) are to be avoided. 
                  b.  A no-access easement of at least 25 feet in width, shall be provided along U.S. or state numbered highways and 10 feet in width along all other county roads. Said easement shall contain a planting screen of trees and shrubs, decorative fencing or other landscape treatment as outlined in this Development Code. 
                  (5)  Lot depth restrictions. Lots in any minor subdivision or major subdivision that front exclusively on, or gain their access from, an existing county road shall have a lot depth no greater than five times the lot frontage. This provision does not apply to any lot that is larger than 25 acres in size. 
                  (6)  Placement of lots. All lots of a new development shall face the interior streets of the development, except where expressly allowed by this Development Code, such as minor subdivisions. 
                  (7)  Grading of lots. 
                  a.  Maximum graded earthen slope shall not be steeper than 2½:1. 
                  b.  Walls providing grade separation greater than two feet in height shall be designed by a registered design professional and subject to inspection by the building inspector. 
                  c.  When a development incorporates step walls, then a registered design professional shall design wall system. 
                  Table 10.1: Slope Height 

                   
                  (h)  Areas reserved for future development . If any portion of a tract is reserved for future subdivision development, the minimum lot width and frontage of the reserved area may be reduced to the width required for a future street to serve such area. 
                  (1)  Such a reserved area must be labeled "reserved for future development" on the final subdivision plat, and the portion of the lot where a street will be built must be labeled "future street". 
                  (2)  Such a reserved area will not be eligible for issuance of a building permit unless the lot meets all requirements of this Development Code, including minimum lot width and frontage requirements of the applicable zoning district. 
                  (i)  Plats straddling political boundaries. Whenever access to a subdivision is required across land in another governmental jurisdiction, the planning director may request assurance from the county attorney, and/or the other county agency that access is legally established, and that the access road is adequately improved. In general, lot lines shall be laid out so as to not cross jurisdictional boundary lines. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 1005, Ord. of 10-25-2005, § 20, Exh. B) 
                  Sec. 89-1180. - Required improvements. 
                  (a)  Minor subdivisions. By definition, a minor subdivision does not involve the construction of major public improvements, such as new streets or stormwater detention. However, the following improvements are required in order to adequately serve the lots and protect the safe operation of the existing road: 
                  (1)  Right-of-way shall be dedicated along the property's frontage from the centerline of the existing road equal to one-half of the minimum requirement for the classification of the road, as established in this article. 
                  (2)  The potential location of a driveway connection serving each lot and meeting the requirements of these development regulations shall be indicated on the final subdivision plat. 
                  (3)  The stormwater carrying capacity of the road, whether in an existing ditch or gutter, shall not be compromised. If the stormwater characteristics of the existing road are inadequate to accommodate the new lots, the director of public works may require improvement of the roadway ditch as appropriate. 
                  (4)  Survey monumentation shall be provided in accordance with section 89-1181. 
                  (5)  A natural resource easement is to be provided along any perennial stream or water impoundment in accordance with the requirements for greenways under the Environmental Protection Article of this Development Code. 
                  (b)  Major subdivisions, multi-family and nonresidential developments. The following improvements shall be provided by the developer or at the developer's expense in every major subdivision or individual multi-family or nonresidential development in accordance with the requirements and standards contained in this article. 
                  (1)  Survey monumentation in accordance with section 89-1181. 
                  (2)  Dedication of easements as set forth under section 89-1182. 
                  (3)  Streets providing access to such a development and to all lots in such a subdivision, including the extension of streets required to provide access to adjoining properties, in accordance with section 89-1183. 
                  a.  Streets contained wholly within such a subdivision shall be improved to the full standards contained in this article. Existing streets that adjoin such a development shall be improved to the minimum standards from the centerline of the street along the development's frontage. 
                  b.  Curb and gutter where required along all roadways. 
                  c.  Dedicated right-of-way along existing streets. 
                  (4)  Street name signs, stop bars, striping and traffic control signs as approved by the county shall be paid for by the developer and installed by the Barrow County Road Department in accordance with section 89-1184. 
                  (5)  Street lights, if desired, in accordance with section 89-1185. 
                  (6)  Driveway access to each lot under the provisions of section 89-1186. 
                  (7)  Deceleration and turn lanes, if required under section 89-1187. 
                  (8)  Sidewalks, if required under subsection 89-1187(b)(7). 
                  (9)  Stormwater drainage and detention facilities in accordance with section 89-1190. 
                  (10)  Public or private water supply as required under section 89-1192. 
                  (11)  Public or private sanitary waste disposal as required under section 89-1193. 
                  (c)  Guarantee in lieu of completed improvements. No final subdivision plat shall be approved by the county until one of the following conditions has been met: 
                  (1)  All required improvements have been constructed or funded in a satisfactory manner and approved by the director of public works; or 
                  (2)  The public works director has received a guarantee, as provided for in section 89-1252(e), in the amount of 150 percent of the estimated cost of installation of the required improvements, and has approved an executed contract as appropriate for installation of the improvements by a qualified contractor. 
                  a.  The improvements funded through the guarantee shall include final pavement topping for streets, grassing of street shoulders, landscaping, sidewalks, street and parking lot striping, and all other improvements required by this Development Code. 
                  b.  The executed contract shall call for completion of the grassing, landscaping and striping improvements within nine months of approval of the final subdivision plat, and for completion of final street topping and sidewalks prior to the end of the maintenance surety period. See the maintenance surety provisions of Land Development Activities, article 11 of this Development Code regarding the maintenance surety period. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 1006, Ord. of 10-25-2005, § 20, Exh. B; Ord. of 11-28-2006, § 2; Ord. of 1-14-2014, § 2) 
                  Sec. 89-1181. - Survey monuments. 
                  All property surveys shall be marked at corners and other pertinent points of reference in the field with monuments as required under this section, and meeting requirements of the Georgia law regarding the recordation of maps and plats (O.C.G.A. § 15-6-67) and additional requirements of the procedures and permits article of this Development Code regarding final plats. Horizontal control shall be based on the Georgia State Plane, and vertical control shall be based on the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
                  (1)  Exterior development boundaries. 
                  a.  An iron pipe or ½-inch iron pin at least 24 inches long shall be placed at all corners of the exterior boundaries of the subdivision or development project being developed and shall be driven no less than one inch above the finished grade. 
                  b.  Existing permanent monuments that, in the professional opinion of a registered land surveyor, are of sufficiently durable construction shall be marked and maintained. 
                  (2)  Lot and street corners. 
                  a.  All other street or lot corners shall be marked with an iron pipe or ½-inch iron pin at least 24 inches long and driven flush or no more than one inch above the finished grade. 
                  b.  All such monuments shall be properly set in the ground and shall be approved by a registered land surveyor prior to the time of final plat approval. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 1007, Ord. of 10-25-2005, § 20, Exh. B) 
                  Sec. 89-1182. - Easements. 
                  (a)  Utility easements. 
                  (1)  Utility easements for private utilities shall be avoided except in cases where no other satisfactory arrangements can be provided for the installation of private utilities. 
                  (2)  Whenever it is necessary or desirable to locate a public utility line outside of the street right-of-way, the line shall be located in an easement dedicated to the county (or other appropriate public entity) for such purpose. Easements for water and sanitary sewers shall be a minimum of 20 feet wide, and may be required to be wider depending on the depth of cut to maintain a 1:1 open cut slope. When warranted, temporary construction easements widths shall be as required by the county. 
                  (3)  Easements for sanitary sewers may be required by the director of public works for future extension of lines, whether or not the subdivision or development is currently proposed to be served by public sewer. 
                  (b)  Pedestrian easements. Pedestrian easements, not less than ten feet wide, may be required where deemed essential to provide circulation, or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, and other community facilities. 
                  (c)  Drainage and access easements. 
                  (1)  Drainage easements for improved ditches, pipe construction, and detention facilities shall be cleared, opened, and stabilized at the time of development to control surface water runoff. Runoff slopes and side slopes shall be specified by the developer's engineer according to good engineering practices. 
                  (2)  Drainage easements shall be provided where a development is traversed by or contains a watercourse, impoundment, detention pond, floodplain, natural stream or channel. It shall conform substantially to the flooding limits of the 100-year storm along such natural drainage feature, but shall not be less than 20 feet in width. 
                  (3)  A publicly dedicated drainage easement is to be provided along any manmade drainage channel or drainage pipe located outside a street right-of-way. All drainage easements shall be calculated as the pipe diameter plus two feet plus two times the depth, rounded up to the nearest five-foot interval, but shall be no less than 20 feet wide. 
                  (4)  Drainage easements outside of the street right-of-way shall be clearly defined on the final plat with dimensions or bearings and distances as appropriate. The property owner will be required to keep the easement free of obstruction in such a way as to assure the maximum designed flow at all times. The property owner shall not alter any drainage improvements without the prior approval from the county. 
                  (5)  Barrow County assumes no responsibility for overflow or erosion of natural or artificial drains beyond the extent of the street right-of-way, or for the extension of culverts beyond the point shown on the approved and recorded plan. Barrow County does not assume the responsibility for the maintenance of pipes or structures in drainage easements beyond the county right-of-way. 
                  (d)  Conservation and natural resource easements. Conservation and natural resource easements, as may be required by this Development Code shall be clearly defined on the plat and deed of the individual property owner, and must conform to the requirements set out for such easements in the environmental protection article of this Development Code. 
                  (e)  Overlapping easements. Easements for water, sanitary sewers and drainage purposes may be combined, but must be a minimum of 30 feet if in combination. Any easement containing more than one pipe must provide at least ten feet beyond the pipe and the pipes must be at least ten feet apart (measured on center). Wider easements shall be required when necessary to maintain a 1:1 open cut slope to each pipe. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 1008, Ord. of 10-25-2005, § 20, Exh. B) 
                  Sec. 89-1183. - Streets. 
                  (a)  Access. 
                  (1)  Each building shall be located on a lot or parcel that abuts a public street or a private street approved by the county, or has access to a public street by means of a recorded access easement as provided for in this Development Code. 
                  (2)  Every development and every major subdivision shall have access to the public street system via a paved road. A building permit shall not be issued unless a publicly dedicated street or an approved private street provides continuous paved road access between the property and the public street system. See subsection (g) below. 
                  (3)  A building permit shall not be issued on any property that does not front on or have approved access to a publicly dedicated street or an approved private street, in accordance with the minimum lot frontage and access easement provisions of this Development Code. 
                  (4)  When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged and designed so as to allow for the opening of future streets and to provide access to those areas not presently served by streets. 
                  (5)  No subdivision or development shall be designed in a way that would completely eliminate street access to adjoining parcels of land. 
                  (6)  Reserve strips which control access to streets, alleys and public grounds shall be prohibited unless their control is placed in the hands of the county under ownership, dedication, or easement conditions approved by the county attorney and the director of planning. 
                  (7)  Subdivision streets that intersect a state or U.S. numbered highway, a county arterial or county collector road shall do so at intervals of not less than 800 feet, or as required by the Georgia Department of Transportation, whichever is greater. On all other roads, at least 300 feet must separate street intersections on the same side of the road, measured centerline to centerline. Compliance with sight distance requirements of this Development Code may require greater distances between street intersections. 
                  (b)  Street classifications. Streets are classified according to the function that they serve, the type, speed, and volume of traffic they will carry and the required standards of design. The classifications of streets and roads are as follows, and as may be shown on the latest adopted or amended Barrow County Thoroughfares: Functional Classification System Map: 
                  (1)  Principal arterials. These roads, which include interstates and rural freeways; serve "substantial" statewide or interstate trips, as defined by high mileage or volume; connect most urban areas of 25,000 or more and virtually all urban areas of 50,000 or more; and provide an integrated network without stub connections except where geography dictates otherwise. 
                  (2)  Minor arterials. With the principal arterial system, these roads form a rural network that links other cities, larger towns, and other traffic generators, such as major resort areas, capable of attracting travel over long distances; links all developed areas of the state; and serve corridors with trip lengths and travel density greater than those predominantly served by rural collector or local systems. Minor arterials therefore constitute routes whose design should be expected to provide for relatively high overall travel speeds, with minimum interference to through-movement. 
                  (3)  Major collectors. These roads, with minor collectors, primarily serve the county rather than state traffic. Consequently, more moderate speeds are typical. They serve any county seat or larger town not on an arterial route, and other traffic generators of equivalent intra county importance, such as consolidated schools, shipping points, county parks, and important mining and agricultural areas; link the latter places with nearby larger towns or cities, or arterials and freeways; and serve the more important intra county travel corridors. 
                  (4)  Minor collectors. Serving county-wide traffic, these roads should evenly collect traffic from local roads and bring all developed areas within a reasonable distance of a collector road; provide service to the remaining smaller communities; and link the locally important traffic generators with the hinterland. 
                  (5)  Local roads. These roads serve primarily to provide access to adjacent land and serve low-mileage trips as compared to collectors or other higher systems. Local roads constitute the rural mileage not classified as part of the principle arterial, minor arterial, or collector systems. 
                  (c)  Extension of existing streets. 
                  (1)  The street pattern within a development or subdivision shall provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of the existing street pattern or anticipated development, if any, at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required minimum width. Topography, natural features such as streams and tree growth shall be considered. 
                  (2)  Existing streets shall be connected and extended within the limits of a new development. However, streets or portions of streets adjacent to a proposed nonresidential or multi-family use, which are developed and are being used exclusively for residential access shall not be connected, extended or in any way provide access to a nonresidential or multi-family use. In addition, private drives which provide access to a nonresidential or multi-family use shall not be permitted in any residential district. 
                  (3)  If the county determines that the roadway should be improved to a standard greater than its current use, due specifically to the traffic that will be generated by the subdivision or development project, the developer shall provide or pay the cost of the additional materials and labor due to the increased use. 
                  (4)  All right-of way required for off-site improvements shall be acquired by the developer at no expense to Barrow County.

                  Sec. 89-1251. - Purpose of article. 
                  This article contains the requirements that apply to carrying out the land development process, including site grading and land disturbance activities; addressing flood hazard areas; the installation of streets, drainage facilities and public utilities; and building construction. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 1101, Ord. of 10-25-2005, § 21, Exh. C) 
                  Sec. 89-1252. - Overview—Project construction. 
                  (a)  Development activity . 
                  (1)  Preconstruction activity. Following the issuance of any permit authorizing clearing and grading of a site, areas required to be undisturbed, such as natural buffers or stream greenways, must be designated and shall be inspected and approved by the planning department prior to the commencement of any clearing or grading activities. 
                  (2)  Grading. 
                  a.  Grading shall be done in accordance with the lines and grades drawn on the approved grading plan. 
                  b.  Required erosion and sedimentation control measures and stormwater drainage facilities are to be installed in accordance with the approved plans as development progresses. 
                  (b)  Development phase inspections. The owner or contractor shall make requests for inspections to the planning department at least 48 hours prior to when the inspection is needed. Inspections shall be made and passed prior to continuation of further activity or proceeding into new phases. Inspections are required of each of the following phases, as applicable to the actual work to be performed under the development permit: 
                  (1)  Prior to clearing or clearing and grubbing of the property or any portion included under the development permit, and after certification by the registered design professional that prepared the plan, inspection of erosion and sedimentation control measures and protective devices for undisturbed areas. Inspections of erosion and sedimentation control measures will be conducted on a continuing basis. 
                  (2)  Upon completion of street grading, inspection and approval shall be required prior to trenching or continuation with subgrade preparation. 
                  (3)  Upon installation of storm drainage pipe, detention, or other stormwater facilities, inspection and approval shall be required. 
                  (4)  Street curbing and gutter (if provided). Inspection shall be requested after the subgrade is compacted and forms or string line have been set. Street width and vertical and horizontal alignment may be spot-checked. 
                  (5)  Sub-grade of streets. After compaction and receipt of test reports by the planning department (as required under subsection 89-1260(g)), the sub-grade shall be roll tested with a fully loaded 18-ton tandem dump truck (confirmed via certified weight ticket), and shall pass to the satisfaction of the development inspector. "Pass" shall be defined as no appreciable movement under the tires during proof rolling. 
                  (6)  Street base. After receipt of test reports by the planning department, the base may be string-lined for depth and crown. The street base may be roll-tested with an 18-ton tandem dump truck and shall pass to the satisfaction of the public works director. 
                  (7)  Paving. A development inspector will periodically be on site during the paving process to check consistency, depth, and workmanship, as applicable. For asphalt paving, the temperature of the material will be monitored and the street will be cored by the developer after completion to check thickness and density. Coring shall be completed at an interval of one core per 500 linear feet of roadway, with no less than one core obtained in each cul-de-sac. Each core shall measure 0.25 inch of the required thickness. Testing standards are shown on Table 11.2. No average thickness evaluation will be allowed. Pavement found to be less than the required thickness shall be removed and replaced with pavement meeting the specification. Overlay of pavement to bring the section into compliance may be allowed at the sole discretion of the director of public works. Satisfactory test results of the cores shall be delivered to the planning department for review by the public works department prior to approval of a final subdivision plat or certificate of occupancy. 
                  (c)  As-built surveys. 
                  (1)  Upon completion of the development activity as authorized by the development permit and prior to final development inspection of public and private improvements, the owner shall submit to the public works department for review and approval a complete set of record drawings showing as-built conditions prepared by a registered land surveyor. These drawings shall show the location, vertical and horizontal alignment, and finished elevations of: 
                  a.  Drainage system pipes and channels. 
                  b.  Stormwater detention facilities, including grading and outlet control structure details (i.e., orifice elevations, sizes, weir sizes, etc.). 
                  c.  Sanitary sewer system (if any). 
                  d.  Water system.

                  f.  Other features as needed to fully document as-built conditions. 
                  (2)  The as-built surveys shall be certified and sealed by the registered land surveyor, subject to the tolerances of accuracy indicated in the survey certification. 
                  (3)  The as-built surveys shall be accompanied by a certified as-built hydrology report prepared by a licensed professional engineer showing that the as-built facility complies with the stormwater regulations. 
                  (4)  The as-built surveys shall be submitted in hard copy format and in a digital format acceptable by the director of public works. 
                  (d)  Final development inspection. 
                  (1)  Following submission and review of the as-built surveys and as-built hydrology report, the public works department shall conduct a final development inspection of the project. 
                  (2)  The owner shall be responsible for correcting any deficiencies identified in the final development inspection prior to approval of a final subdivision plat. 
                  (e)  Maintenance and performance guarantees. 
                  (1)  Prior to approval of a final subdivision plat, or issuance of a certificate of occupancy for a multi-family or nonresidential development project, maintenance and performance guarantees, in forms as described in this section below, are required for all public improvements shown on the as-built surveys. The owner shall be responsible for maintenance of all such public improvements for one and one-half years from the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy or final subdivision plat approval, as applicable, and for topping of roads pursuant to subsection 89-1180(c). 
                  (2)  The value of the maintenance guarantee shall be equal to 33 percent of the actual cost of construction of the public improvements shown on the as-built surveys. Copies of contractor agreements or actual invoices paid, or as otherwise determined by the public works director, shall evidence the cost of construction. The value of the performance guarantees shall be determined in accordance with subsection 89-1180(c). 
                  (3)  Repairs shall be made for any deficiencies identified within the bonding period of the guarantees or the guarantees shall be called upon to complete same. 
                  (4)  Any guarantee required pursuant to this article shall be either: 1) in a form provided by the county and by a surety in good standing with the Georgia Insurance and Fire Safety Commissioner's Office and listed in Circular 570 (Federal Register Vol. 62, No. 126) among companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties on federal bonds and as acceptable reinsuring companies; or 2) a cash guarantee in a form provided by the county. These two options are referred to collectively herein as the "guarantees." 
                  (5)  A maintenance guarantee for the water system improvements and the sanitary facilities may be required separately by the authority having jurisdiction, in accordance with their regulations. For both the water system and sewer system improvements, the developer shall be responsible for maintenance of all water and sewer mains and appurtenances for one year from the date of approval of the certificate of development conformance by correcting all defects or deficiencies in materials and workmanship. 
                  (6)  In cases where the maintenance and performance guarantees are to cover a second phase or any other later stage of a development project governed by this article, said guarantees shall be required to be extended in amount and application to cover the original phase of the project in addition to said later phase for the same period of application as set out in this Development Code if the later phase will utilize the same entrance-street as that used by the original phase of the project. 
                  (7)  The maintenance guarantee shall include the estimated cost for maintenance of the drainage and detention pond facilities during the one and one-half-year maintenance period. Maintenance shall include repair of erosion controls, removal of silt from detention ponds and other items pertinent to the drainage system for each development. 
                  (8)  In the event the development has not completed at least 90 percent build out by the end of the original guarantee period, the guarantee shall be renewed in 18-month intervals until 90 percent build out is achieved (i.e. certificate of occupancy is issued on 90 percent of the homes). 
                  (9)  When all of the following four conditions are met, this subsection (9) shall apply: 1) a final subdivision plat has been approved; 2) the original owner of the subdivision at the time of approval of the subdivision plat no longer owns any lots in said subdivision, has filed for bankruptcy, or is otherwise determined to be insolvent; 3) either no maintenance guarantee or performance guarantee is in place for the subdivision; and 4) more than one person or entity owns undeveloped lots (i.e. lots without a certificate of occupancy) in said subdivision such that posting of a guarantee(s) for the entire subdivision is not feasible. In the event of the fulfillment of the above-stated four conditions, the county may, in its discretion, accept from the applicant for a building permit or for a certificate of occupancy for any lot or series of lots, a cash guarantee in the amount of a by-lot, pro-rata portion of the amount of the applicable guarantee that would otherwise be required for the entire subdivision, in lieu of the guarantees required to provide for maintenance and performance requirements for the entire subdivision. By way of example, in a 100-lot subdivision for which the normal required maintenance guarantee would be $10,000.00 and the normal performance guarantee would be $20,000.00, an applicant for one lot could provide a cash maintenance guarantee in the amount of $100.00 and a cash performance guarantee in the amount of $200.00; an applicant for two lots could provide a cash maintenance guarantee in the amount of $200.00 and a cash performance guarantee in the amount of $400.00. This subsection (9) is intended to apply only in exceptional circumstances where neither the original subdivision owner nor their successor in interest exists or is solvent and multiple builders have purchased lots in the subdivision, and only in order for the county to ensure a funding source for the maintenance and performance costs associated with the subdivision. 
                  (f)  Abandoned projects. Any project whose permit has lapsed under the terms expressed in this Development Code shall immediately proceed to stabilize all disturbed areas. This responsibility shall fall upon the owner, developer, contractor, or any and all.

                  (d)  Clearing and grubbing. 
                  (1)  The entire area within the typical grading section shall be cleared and grubbed of all trees, bushes, stumps and debris. Such debris shall be disposed of in a lawful manner. Burial of clearing and grubbing debris on-site is not authorized. 
                  (2)  Grading plans shall outline the areas, which are required to remain undisturbed, including tree protection areas, buffers and shall indicate protective fencing to be placed surrounding such areas. 
                  (3)  Grading plans shall show existing and proposed contour lines at an interval of no more than two feet with additional spot elevations for critical areas. 
                  (e)  Earthen embankments. Earthen embankments shall be placed in uniform layers not to exceed a compacted thickness of six inches per layer and shall be compacted to a density of 95 percent of the maximum laboratory dry weight per cubic foot as determined by standard proctor test method in all areas where structures, parking lots and drives streets, and utilities are to be placed. If necessary in order to obtain this compaction, the contractor shall add moisture to the material as it is placed. All other embankments are to be compacted to at least 90 percent. Floodproofing shall be accomplished prior to placement of embankments to detect soft spots. 
                  (f)  Slopes. 
                  (1)  The maximum slope for all cut or fill slopes shall be as shown on Table 11.1. 
                  (2)  The depth of cut referenced in the table shall be construed to be the maximum cut or fill occurring in any one section of cut or fill. The slope on cut or fill shall be uniform throughout for each section of cut or fill, except when the director of public works approves benching. When a cut is made in rock that requires blasting, slope may be changed to vertical slope may be steeper if pre-splitting is employed and upon submission of a certified geotechnical report which substantiates the integrity of the rock in the steeper condition, subject to review and approval of the director of public works. 
                  (3)  Some soils exhibit a low shearing and resistance and a low cohesiveness. These soils typically are micaceous silts and sandy soils with little or no clay. If the 2:1 slope shows evidence of shearing, noncohesiveness, sliding, or an inability to maintain compaction, the slope shall be stabilized at 3:1 or by using such mechanical methods as needed, such as retaining walls or "grow mats" stapled in place to maintain slope height and integrity.

                  Sec. 89-1254.7. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this ordinance shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of section 89-1254.7(b) and (c) of this ordinance. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES General Permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in section 89-1254.7(b) and (c) of this ordinance shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land- disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of code section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in section 89-1254.7(c)(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 (c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 89-1254.7(b)(2) of this ordinance; 
                  (15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the Director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the Director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed ; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to code section 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to code section 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
                  d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 89-1254.7(b) and (c) of this ordinance. 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit.

                  --- (5) --- 
                  Editor's note— An ordinance adopted November 24, 2009, §§ I—VI, amended § 89-1258 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly said section pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 1105; Ord. of 10-25-2005, § 21, Exh. C. See also the editors note located at Art. XI, Div. 2 of this chapter. 

                  Sec. 89-1258. - Flood damage prevention. 
                  (a)  Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives. 
                  (1)  Authorization. Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Barrow County Board of Commissioners, of Barrow County, Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
                  (2)  Findings of fact. 
                  a.  The flood hazard areas of Barrow County, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  b.  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (3)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  a.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  b.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  c.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
                  d.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
                  e.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (4)  Objectives. The objectives of this ordinance are: 
                  a.  To protect human life and health; 
                  b.  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  c.  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  d.  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  e.  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  f.  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
                  g.  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
                  (b)  General provisions. 
                  (1)  Lands to which this ordinance applies. This ordinance shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Barrow County, Georgia. 
                  (2)  Basis for area of special flood hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS), dated October 16, 1991, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this ordinance. 
                  Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS. (No Known Flood Hazards) 
                  The Repository for public inspection of the Flood Insurance Study (FIS), accompanying maps and other supporting data is located: Barrow County Department of Community and County Development, 233 East Broad Street, Winder, GA 30680. 
                  (3)  Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this ordinance PRIOR to the commencement of any development activities. 
                  (4)  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations. 
                  (5)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing ordinance, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
                  (6)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this ordinance all provisions shall be: (1) considered as minimum requirements; (2) liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and; (3) deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state or federal statutes. 
                  (7)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the Barrow County or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
                  (8)  Penalties for violation. Failure to comply with the provisions of this ordinance or with any of its requirements, including conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a violation and shall be unlawful. Any person who violates this ordinance or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $1,000.00 or imprisoned for not more than five days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Barrow County Board of Commissioners from taking such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

                  b.  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge; and 
                  c.  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. ( NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-Zone areas where a Limited Detail Study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection(d)(1)d. "Elevated Buildings." 
                  1.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The Barrow County Department of Community and County Development Director shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
                  (4)  Standards for areas of special flood hazard (Zones AE) with established base flood elevations without designated floodways. Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in subsection (b)(2), where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated, (Zones AE) the following provisions apply: 
                  a.  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the county. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
                  b.  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with subsection(d)(2). 
                  (5)  Standards for areas of subsection hallow flooding (AO Zones). Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in (b)(2), may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas.

                  (4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of Historic Structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a Historic Structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if ANY increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (7)  In reviewing such requests, the Barrow County Board of Commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this ordinance. 
                  (8)  Conditions for variances: 
                  a.  A variance shall be issued ONLY when there is: 
                  1.  a finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  2.  a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  3.  a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  b.  The provisions of this rdinance are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an Historic Structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  c.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  d.  The Barrow County Department of Community and County Development Director shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (9)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the Barrow County Board of Commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance.

                  "Start of construction" means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. ( NOTE: Accessory structures are NOT exempt from any ordinance requirements) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  "Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  "Subdivision" [means] the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
                  "Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions" is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  "Variance" is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance. 
                  "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the county's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 89-1315. - Amendments to the land use plan and Development Code. 
                  (a)  Land use plan amendments. 
                  (1)  Generally. The comprehensive plan may be amended from time to time for specific properties or areas on the future land use map by the board of commissioners, subject to the requirements of the Georgia Zoning Procedures Act, O.C.G.A. §§ 36-66-1 et seq. Such a change is referred to as a "land use plan amendment," or LUP amendment, in this Development Code. 
                  (2)  State of Georgia oversight. 
                  a.  Developments of regional impact (DRIs). A proposed LUP amendment shall be submitted to the Northeast Georgia Regional Development Commission if the proposed LUP amendment qualifies as a development of regional impact under the procedures of section 89-1328. 
                  b.  Major amendments. If the board of commissioners, at its public hearing, determines that the LUP amendment is a "major amendment" under the state guidelines in that it is justified only because the conditions or policies underlying the comprehensive plan have change significantly so as to alter the basic tenets of the plan, or that the proposal will significantly affect another political jurisdiction, then no action shall be taken on the amendment until the review process mandated by the state's minimum standards and procedures for local comprehensive planning shall have been completed. 
                  c.  Effect of a land use plan amendment approval. Approval of a land use plan amendment shall be in full force and effect upon its approval by the board of commissioners. 
                  (b)  Development code text amendments. 
                  (1)  Generally. The text of the Development Code may be amended from time to time by the board of commissioners, subject to the requirements of the Georgia Zoning Procedures Act, O.C.G.A. §§ 36-66-1 et seq. 
                  (2)  Process for amending text. Before the board of commissioners may take final action on a proposed amendment to the Development Code text, the board of commissioners shall hold a public hearing on the proposal pursuant to the notice and hearing requirements of the Georgia Zoning Procedures Act. 
                  (3)  Hearings by the planning commission. In addition to the hearing by the board of commissioners, the economic and community development director, in his or her discretion, may require a public hearing by the planning commission on any proposed amendment to the Development Code text. If applicable, such hearing by the planning commission shall be held prior to the public hearing by the board of commissioners, and shall also be subject to the requirements of the Georgia Zoning Procedures Act. Upon conclusion of any public hearing conducted by the planning commission on a text amendment, the planning commission may recommend to the board of commissioners approval of the proposed text amendment, approval of a revised version of the proposed text amendment, or rejection of the proposed text amendment. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 1205; Ord. of 10-25-2005, §§ 4, 5; Ord. of 11-26-2013, § 4) 
                  Sec. 89-1316. - Rezoning approval. 
                  The official zoning map may be amended from time to time by the board of commissioners under the procedures in this section.

Completed forms, plus any information the applicant feels to be pertinent is to be filed with the planning department. 
                  c.  The planning department shall review the application submitted by an owner or the owner's authorized representative for completeness within five days of submission. Incomplete or improper applications will be returned to the applicant. Any zoning application that causes the total number of zoning applications accepted per zoning cycle to exceed 15 will be held until and included in the next zoning cycle in the order in which they are submitted. 
                  d.  Reserved. 
                  e.  An application submitted by an owner or the owner's authorized representative for rezoning affecting the same property shall not be considered by the board of commissioners more often than once every 12 months from the date of action by the board of commissioners denying the rezoning; provided, however, that the board of commissioners may approve a reduction in the waiting period to no less than six months. A county-initiated zoning can be pursued by the board of commissioners at any time.

                  c.  Decision. 
                  1.  The planning commission shall take action on the rezoning application at its public hearing. 
                  i.  The planning commission's action may recommend amendments and conditions to the applicant's request which may be deemed advisable so that the purpose of this Development Code will be served. 
                  ii.  Failure to make a recommendation shall go forward to the board of commissioners as "no comment". 
                  2.  Following the planning commission's public hearing, the board of commissioners shall consider the rezoning application at the next meeting scheduled for the purpose of considering zoning amendments for which adequate notice has or can be published. 
                  3.  In considering a rezoning application, action shall be taken by the board of commissioners by vote of the members present. 
                  i.  A motion to approve or deny an application must be approved by an affirmative vote of a majority of a quorum of the members present in order for the motion to be approved. 
                  ii.  If a motion to approve an application fails, the application is automatically denied. If a motion to deny an application fails, another motion would be in order. 
                  iii.  If a vote results in a tie among the district commissioners, the chair shall cast his or her vote to break the tie. In the absence of the chair, a tie vote shall automatically table the matter until the next regular zoning meeting of the board of commissioners. 
                  iv.  If no action is taken on an application, it shall be considered tabled and action deferred to the next regular zoning meeting of the board of commissioners. 
                  v.  A final decision must be made no later than the third meeting at which the rezoning application appears on the board's agenda (i.e., following the board's public hearing, the application may not be deferred or tabled more than twice). If, at the third meeting, the board is unable to take final action, the application shall be considered denied. 
                  4.  In taking final action on an application, the board of commissioners may: 
                  i.  Approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application; or 
                  ii.  Approve or approve with conditions any portion of the area proposed for rezoning, thus reducing the boundaries of the area rezoned; or 
                  iii.  Rezone the area or any portion of the area proposed for rezoning to another zoning district that is deemed more appropriate than that requested by the applicant; or 
                  iv.  Allow withdrawal of said request by the applicant (with or without opposing a 12-month period during with another zoning change on the property may not be considered); or 
                  v.  Table the application for consideration at its next scheduled zoning meeting; or 
                  vi.  Return the application to the planning commission for further consideration; or 
                  vii.  Such other action as the board of commissioners may, in its discretion, deem advisable. 
                  (5)  Standards for rezoning consideration. 
                  a.  Map amendments (rezoning). The planning commission and the board of commissioners shall consider the following standards in considering any rezoning proposal, giving due weight or priority to those factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of each proposal: 
                  1.  Is the proposed use consistent with the stated purpose of the zoning district that is being requested? 
                  2.  Is the proposed use suitable in view of the zoning and development of adjacent and nearby property? 
                  3.  Will the proposed use not adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property? 
                  4.  Is the proposed use compatible with the goals, objectives, purpose and intent of the comprehensive plan? 
                  5.  Are their substantial reasons why the property cannot or should not be used as currently zoned? 
                  6.  Will the proposed use not cause an excessive or burdensome use of public facilities or services, including but not limited to streets, schools, water or sewer utilities, and police or fire protection? 
                  7.  Is the proposed use supported by new or changing conditions not anticipated by the comprehensive plan or reflected in the existing zoning on the property or surrounding properties? 
                  8.  Does the proposed use reflect a reasonable balance between the promotion of the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare and the right to unrestricted use of property? 
                  b.  Change in conditions of rezoning approval. Any application that proposes a change in the conditions of approval previously established by the board of commissioners through action on a rezoning shall be reviewed in light of the standards set forth in this subsection for map amendments. 
                  (6)  Withdrawal of rezoning request . Any applicant wishing to withdraw a proposed rezoning prior to final action by the board of commissioners shall file a written request for withdrawal with the director of planning. 
                  a.  If the request for withdrawal is received prior to the publication of notice for the public hearing, the director of planning shall withdraw the application administratively without restriction on the refiling of a proposed rezoning on the property in the future. 
                  b.  If notice has been published (or is irretrievably set for publication) but the application has not been heard by the planning commission, the application shall be withdrawn administratively by the director of planning, and an application for a rezoning on the property may not be resubmitted for six months from the date of withdrawal. 
                  c.  Should any request for withdrawal be made by the applicant after the planning commission hearing but before the board of commissioners hearing, the application shall remain on the board of commissioners' public hearing agenda and the withdrawal request shall be considered for approval or denial, with or without prejudice, by the board of commissioners. 
                  d.  Approval of a rezoning shall be in full force and effect upon its approval by the board of commissioners. 
                  e.  For a property on which a use, building, structure or other improvements existed in conformity with this Development Code prior to the effective date of a rezoning affecting the property, any such use, building, structure or other improvements no longer in conformance shall be governed under the provisions of Article I of this Development Code relating to grandfathered development. 
                  f.  Construction of any use, building, structure, or other improvements for which a building permit has been issued in conformity with this Development Code prior to the effective date of a rezoning affecting the property may continue to completion in accordance with the provisions for exemptions of previously issued permits in Article I and, upon completion, shall be governed under the provisions of the grandfathered development section of said article, as applicable. 
                  (7)  Vesting of rezoning approval. After an approval has been granted by the board of commissioners for a rezoning, the applicant, agent or property owner has 24 months to vest the rezoning approval. To vest a rezoning approval and forego its expiration, the applicant must record a final subdivision plat, receive project approval of a preliminary plat or site plan, obtain a building permit or lawfully initiate the use, whichever occurs first. If the applicant, agent, or property owner fails to vest the rezoning approval, the board of commissioners may initiate a rezoning application to revert the property to the previously zoned condition. Such reversionary action shall proceed in accordance with provisions of this article pertaining to rezoning approvals. The owner of the property will be notified of the reversionary action and afforded an opportunity to appear before the board of commissioners to show just cause why the reversionary action should not be taken.

The notice shall state the time, place and purpose of the hearing. 
                  2.  A special use request initiated by an owner or their representative shall be heard at a public hearing only upon: 
                  i.  The published notice, in addition to the requirements above, shall include the location of the property, the present zoning classification of the property, and the proposed zoning classification of the property requested; and 
                  ii.  At least 15 days prior to the public hearing, the applicant shall post a sign or signs, as provided by the planning department, stating the date, time and place for the planning commission public hearing and the initially scheduled board of commissioners public hearing, the present zoning classification and the nature of the proposed zoning change. One such sign shall be placed in a conspicuous location along each street frontage of the property for which the rezoning has been requested. If the property has no street frontage, the sign shall be placed on each street from which access will be gained to the property. 
                  b.  Public hearings; procedures. The public hearing held by the planning commission and the board of commissioners for a special use is to be conducted in the following manner: 
                  1.  The chair or an appointed designee, who will act as the presiding official, will convene the public hearing at the scheduled time and place.

                  ii.  No less than ten minutes will be provided for all of those speaking in support of a special use approval and no less than ten minutes shall be provided for all of those speaking against, unless such proponents or opponents take less time than the minimum allowed. 
                  iii.  If reasonable time limitations permit, any member of the general public may speak at a hearing. 
                  4.  The applicant will be allowed to speak first in order to present the application. Others in support of the application may then speak, followed by those in opposition to the application. The applicant will then be allowed time for rebuttal. Rebuttal must be limited to points or issues raised by opponents to the application at the hearing. 
                  5.  Following the presentation of positions by members of the public, a recommendation from Barrow County staff shall be presented. 
                  6.  During the public hearing, the members of the planning commission or the board of commissioners may ask questions at any time. Time devoted to questions and answers will not be counted against any time limitations that have been imposed on presentations.

                  c.  Decision. 
                  1.  The planning commission shall take action on the special use application at its public hearing. 
                  i.  The planning commission's action may recommend amendments and conditions to the applicant's request which may be deemed advisable so that the purpose of this Development Code will be served. 
                  ii.  Failure to make a recommendation shall go forward to the board of commissioners as "no comment". 
                  2.  Following the planning commission's public hearing, the board of commissioners shall consider the special use application at the next meeting scheduled for the purpose of considering special use applications for which adequate notice has or can be published. 
                  3.  In considering a special use request, action shall be taken by the board of commissioners by vote of the members present, as follows: 
                  i.  A motion to approve or deny an application must be approved by an affirmative vote of at least a majority of a quorum of the members present in order for the motion to be approved. 
                  ii.  If a motion to approve an application fails, the application is automatically denied. If a motion to deny an application fails, another motion would be in order. 
                  iii.  If a vote results in a tie among the district commissioners, the chair shall cast his or her vote to break the tie. In the absence of the chair, a tie vote shall automatically table the matter until the next regular zoning meeting of the board of commissioners. 
                  iv.  If no action is taken on an application, it shall be considered tabled and action deferred to the next regular zoning meeting of the board of commissioners. 
                  v.  A final decision must be made no later than the third meeting at which the rezoning application appears on the board's agenda (i.e., following the board's public hearing, the application may not be deferred or tabled more than twice). If, at the third meeting, the board is unable to take final action, the application shall be considered denied. 
                  4.  In taking action on an application, the board of commissioners may: 
                  i.  Approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposal; or 
                  ii.  Allow withdrawal if so requested by the applicant (with or without imposing a 12-month period during which another special use on the property may not be considered); or 
                  iii.  Table the proposal for consideration at its next scheduled meeting; or 
                  iv.  Return the proposal to the planning commission for further consideration. 
                  (5)  Standards for special use consideration. 
                  a.  Approval of special use. A use that would be allowed otherwise permitted within a zoning district with special use approval shall be considered to be compatible with other uses permitted in the district, provided that due consideration is given to the following objective criteria. Emphasis may be placed on those criteria most applicable to the specific use proposed: 
                  1.  Will the proposed special use be consistent with the stated purpose of the zoning district in which it will be located? 
                  2.  Is the proposed special use compatible with the goals, objectives, purpose and intent of the comprehensive plan? 
                  3.  Will the establishment of the special use impede the normal and orderly development of surrounding property for uses predominate in the area? 
                  4.  Is the location and character of the proposed special use consistent with a desirable pattern of development for the locality in general? 
                  5.  Is or will the type of street providing access to the use be adequate to serve the proposed special use? 
                  6.  Is or will access into and out of the property be adequate to provide for traffic and pedestrian safety, the anticipated volume of traffic flow, and access by emergency vehicles? 
                  7.  Are or will public facilities such as schools, water or sewer utilities, and police or fire protection be adequate to serve the special use? 
                  8.  Are or will refuse, service, parking and loading areas on the property be located or screened to protect other properties in the area from such adverse effects as noise, light, glare or odor? 
                  9.  Will the hours and manner of operation of the special use have no adverse effects on other properties in the area? 
                  10.  Will the height, size or location of the buildings or other structures on the property be compatible with the height, size or location of buildings or other structures on neighboring properties? 
                  b.  Change in conditions of special use approval. Any application that proposes a change in the conditions of approval previously established by the board of commissioners through action on a special use shall be reviewed in light of the standards set forth in this section for a special use, as appropriate. 
                  (6)  Withdrawal of special use request. Any applicant wishing to withdraw a special use application prior to final action by the board of commissioners shall file a written request for withdrawal with the director of planning. 
                  a.  If the request for withdrawal is received prior to the publication of notice for the public hearing, the application shall be withdrawn administratively by the director of planning without restriction on the refiling of a proposed special use on the property in the future. 
                  b.  If notice has been published (or is irretrievably set for publication) but the application has not been heard by the planning commission, the application shall be withdrawn administratively by the director of planning, and an application for a special use on the property may not be resubmitted for six months from the date of withdrawal. 
                  c.  Should any request for withdrawal be made by the applicant after the planning commission hearing but before the board of commissioners' hearing, the application shall remain on the board of commissioners' public hearing agenda and the withdrawal request shall be considered for approval or denial, with or without prejudice, by the board of commissioners. 
                  (7)  Effect of special use denial. 
                  a.  If an application for special use approval is denied by the board of commissioners, then any portion of the same property may not again be considered for a approval of the same or another special use for a period of 12 months from the date of the denial action by the board of commissioners. 
                  b.  The board may only reconsider property for special use approval within the 12-month time period in connection with settlement of litigation or pursuant to an order by a court of competent jurisdiction. However, the board, if time permits, shall direct staff to advertise, post the property, and notify the applicant and owner in writing prior to taking such action. 
                  (8)  Effect of special use approval. 
                  a.  Approval of a special use shall be in full force and effect upon approval by the board of commissioners. 
                  b.  A special use approval. 
                  c.  For a property on which a use, building, structure or other improvements existed in conformity with this Development Code prior to the effective date of a special use approval affecting the property, any such use, building, structure or other improvements no longer in conformance shall be governed under the provisions of Article I of this Development Code relating to grandfathered development. 
                  d.  Construction of any use, building, structure, or other improvements for which a building permit has been issued in conformity with this Development Code prior to the effective date of a special use approval affecting the property may continue to completion in accordance with the provisions for exemptions of previously issued permits in Article I and, upon completion, shall be governed under the provisions of the grandfathered development section of said article, as applicable. 
                  (9)  Vesting of special use approval. After an approval has been granted by the board of commissioners for a special use, the applicant, agent or property owner has 24 months to vest the special use approval. To vest a special use approval and forego its expiration, the applicant must record a final subdivision plat, receive project approval of a preliminary plat or site plan, obtain a building permit or lawfully initiate the use, whichever occurs first. If the applicant, agent, or property owner fails to vest the special use approval, the board of commissioners may initiate a special use application to revert the property to the previously zoned condition. Such reversionary action shall proceed in accordance with provisions of this article pertaining to special use approvals. The owner of the property will be notified of the reversionary action and afforded an opportunity to appear before the board of commissioners to show just cause why the reversionary action should not be taken. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 1207; Ord. of 10-25-2005, §§ 11, 18; Ord. of 4-11-2017, § 7) 
                  Sec. 89-1318. - Project approval. 
                  The planning department must first approve a preliminary plat for a major subdivision or a site plan for development of a multi-family or nonresidential project prior to the issuance of a development permit or initiation of any land disturbing or construction activities. 
                  (1)  Responsibility for project approval. 
                  a.  The director of planning is responsible for administering the review and approval process for preliminary subdivision plats and site plans. The director of planning shall forward a copy of the project approval application to other appropriate county departments, the Georgia Department of Transportation, or others as appropriate, for their review and comment. The director of planning shall provide all comments to the applicant for resolution, who shall work directly with each department as necessary to resolve all issues. 
                  b.  A preliminary plat or site plan may be prepared by a professional engineer, a registered land surveyor, a landscape architect, a land planner or any other person professionally familiar with land development and project construction activities. 
                  (2)  Procedure for project approval. 
                  a.  A pre-application review with a preliminary concept plan is suggested. Such concept plan shall be the concept plan associated with rezoning or special use approval of the property, if any. 
                  b.  An application for project approval may be processed independently or in conjunction with an application for issuance of a development permit. 
                  c.  An application for project approval shall be submitted to the planning department. The application shall include: 
                  1.  The name and address of the person requesting review. 
                  2.  A properly completed application form, as furnished by the planning department, requesting review for project approval. 
                  3.  A number of copies, as established by the director of planning, of the preliminary subdivision plat or site plan showing the entire ownership drawn to the specifications of this section. 
                  4.  Payment of the applicable application and review fees as established by the board of commissioners from time to time. 
                  d.  The planning department will review the application for completeness within five days of submission. Incomplete applications will be returned to the applicant. 
                  e.  If the subdivision includes or abuts a U.S. or state numbered highway, unless all of the lots in the subdivision contain five acres or more and no new street is involved, review by the Georgia Department of Transportation (DOT) is required under O.C.G.A. § 32-6-151. Two additional copies of the final plat must be submitted to the planning department for forwarding to DOT. The owner or subdivider must respond to the recommendations of the DOT prior to project approval by the county. If the written recommendations of the DOT are not made within 30 days of receipt of the plat by DOT, their approval shall be assumed as provided under state law. 
                  f.  Following review of the application, the planning department will indicate on the drawing or in writing all comments related to compliance with this Development Code. 
                  g.  The owner is responsible for compliance with all codes, regulations and zoning requirements, including all codes and requirements of other departments and agencies* (such as NPDES and Section 404, as applicable), and for the satisfaction of all the noted and written comments. 
                  * See the list of other departments and agencies under subsection 89-1320(e)(5). 
                  h.  The planning department may not approve any preliminary subdivision plat or site plan that shows a lot or situation that would clearly require a variance to order to be reasonably usable, whether due to the presence of floodplain, unusual configuration, zoning compliance, lack of public utilities, or for any other reason. 
                  i.  When the planning department has determined that the preliminary subdivision plat or site plan is in compliance with the requirements, purpose and intent of this Development Code, it will be approved. The director of planning will sign and date the certificate of project approval stamped or printed on a reproducible copy of the preliminary subdivision plat or site plan. One copy of the approved drawing will be transmitted to the applicant and one copy will be retained by the planning department. 
                  j.  The certificate of project approval will remain in effect for a period of 12 consecutive months after which time it will become null and void and a new certificate may be required if no permit has been issued or no development activity has begun.

                  (1)  Qualifications. Employees of a sexually oriented establishment shall not be less than 18 years of age. Every employee must be of good moral character as defined in this Development Code.

Upon approval, the employee may begin working on the premises. If approval is denied, the prospective employee may, within ten days of the denial, apply to the licensing officer for a hearing. The decision of the licensing officer after hearing may be appealed to the board of commissioners, which may issue such order as is proper on the premises. An investigation fee of $50.00 shall accompany the notice of intended employment or a receipt of the licensing officer evidencing the payment of such fee shall be presented at the time the notice is filed. 
                  (3)  Suspension or revocation of license. Violation of the provisions of this Development Code, the ordinances of the county, the laws and regulations of the state or the rules and regulations of the county shall subject an employee of a sexually oriented establishment to suspension or revocation of his or her license. 
                  (4)  Independent contractors. For the purpose of this section, independent contractors shall be considered as employees and shall be licensed as employees, regardless of the business relationship with the owner or licensee of any sexually oriented establishment.

                  (c)  Conditions. The board of appeals may, as a condition of the variance approval, require that alternative measures be taken by the applicant such that the purposes of this Development Code may be achieved through alternative means.

                  (f)  Fair Housing Act accommodation variance. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this article XIII to the contrary, the board of appeals may grant a variance to the limitations on personal care homes contained in section 89-179 and the definitions referenced therein if the applicant for such a variance shows a documented need for accommodation based on medical or scientific studies, that the requested accommodation is the minimum necessary variance from the restrictions of the UDC, that the requested accommodation does not impose an undue burden or expense on the county or its citizens, and that the requested accommodation does not effectively create a fundamental alteration of the existing zoning scheme. An application for a Fair Housing Act accommodation variance shall comply with all other procedural requirements for consideration and approval of hardship variances.

                  Sec. 89-1446. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  Enforcement officer. 
                  (1)  Representatives of the planning director, the building official, the director of public works and the sheriff's office shall have the power to conduct such investigations as may reasonably be deemed necessary to assure or compel compliance with the requirements and provisions of this Development Code, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property for the purpose of investigation and inspection. 
                  (2)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the county, the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission, the soil and water conservation district, or the Georgia Environmental Protection Division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (b)  Citations. Any violation of this Development Code may be tried upon a citation issued by the sheriff or any other authorized representative of the county pursuant to the provisions of this development code and state law. Without limitation, builders, developers, contractors, property owners, and such other parties responsible for the violation may be cited for violation of any provisions of this Development Code. 
                  (c)  Land development activities. 
                  (1)  Periodic inspections. 
                  a.  The planning director will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which development permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the erosion and sediment control plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. 
                  b.  In addition, the planning director shall regulate both primary and secondary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities 
                  (2)  Notice of violation. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved erosion and sediment control plan, with development permit conditions, or with any other provisions relating to land development activities of this Development Code, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person (which notice may consist of a stop-work order). The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this Development Code and deemed to have forfeited any required performance bond if required to post one under the provisions of this Development Code. The county may call the performance bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (3)  Stop-work orders. 
                  a.  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the planning director (or designee) shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the planning director shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the planning director shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  b.  For a third and each subsequent violation, the planning director shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and; 
                  c.  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Stop-work orders may be either personally served or posted at the primary entrance of the land-disturbing activity. 
                  d.  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by planning director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the planning director or his or her designee. All such stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop-work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  e.  Upon the issuance of a stop-work order, the permittee shall also be served with a citation and summons specifying the violation(s) and returnable to the county magistrate court. 
                  (4)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 89-1320 of this Development Code. Barrow County may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Land use and other provisions. 
                  (1)  Inspection. If the director of planning finds that a provision of this Development Code is being violated relating to the use or occupancy of land or structures, lot standards, landscaping, buffers, tree conservation, parking, signage, flood damage prevention or any other standard or provision (other than land development activities as may be authorized by a development permit), or relating to a condition of approval established in connection with a grant of variance or zoning change, he or she shall authorize notification to the person responsible for such violation in writing (which notification may consist of an order to cease and desist the violation). The notification shall indicate the nature of the violation and order the action necessary to correct it. Upon continuing noncompliance, or initially in the case of an immediate threat to the public health or safety, the director of planning shall have authority to prosecute violations in court. 
                  (2)  Cease and desist orders. The director of planning shall order discontinuance of illegal use of land, buildings or structures; removal or relocation of illegal buildings or structures or of illegal additions, alterations or structural changes; discontinuance of illegal work being done; or shall take any other appropriate or necessary action to ensure compliance with or to prevent violation of the provisions of this Development Code. 
                  (e)  Removal of illegal signs. The building official may order the removal of any sign in violation of this Development Code by written notice to the permit holder; or if there is no permit holder, then to the owner of the sign; or if the sign owner cannot be found or cannot be determined, then to the sign erector and any party that procured the erection of the sign. If a permit was issued, such notice shall operate to revoke the permit. The removal order shall be issued only after the appropriate party fails to comply within seven days after the county gives written notice of noncompliance. 
                  (1)  Procedure following removal order. An aggrieved party may appeal the removal order within ten days from the date that the notice was mailed. Such appeal shall be made to the board of commissioners. If the sign is not removed within 30 days after the order of removal (or 30 days after the date any appeal becomes final), the building official is authorized to remove or cause to be removed the sign and to collect the costs thereof as provided below. 
                  (2)  Removal without notice. 
                  a.  The building official or any other agent of the county having jurisdiction under the circumstances may remove or direct the removal of any sign in violation of this Development Code, without giving notice to any party, if: 
                  1.  Said sign is upon the public right-of-way or upon other public property; or 
                  2.  Said sign poses an immediate safety threat to the life or health of any members of the public. 
                  b.  Following such removal, the county may collect the costs as provided in the following section. 
                  (3)  Costs of removal. 
                  a.  Removal of any sign found in violation shall be without liability to the county, its officers, agents, and employees. The permit holder shall be primarily responsible for the costs of removal. If there is no permit holder, then the sign owner shall be responsible. If the sign owner cannot be determined, then the costs of removal shall be the responsibility of the sign erector and any party that procured the erection of the sign. 
                  b.  If payment or arrangement to make payment is not made within 60 days after the receipt of a statement of removal costs, the building official shall certify the amount thereof for collection to the county attorney. In the event the removed sign(s) remains unclaimed for more than one year from the date of impound, the sign(s) shall be disposed of in accordance with state law. 
                  c.  Costs of removal shall be charged in accordance with a fee schedule adopted by the board of commissioners from time to time, or at the actual cost to the county, whichever is more appropriate to the action taken. 
                  (f)  Referral to sheriff. Any violation alleged under this Development Code may be referred to the sheriff's office for investigation, citation and enforcement. 
                  (Ord. of 1-11-2005, § 1406) 
                  Sec. 89-1447. - Violation and penalties. 
                  (a)  Violation of a misdemeanor. Violation of any provision of this Development Code, including violation of conditions of approval established in connection with grants of variance or zoning changes, shall constitute a misdemeanor. 
                  (b)  Failure to obtain a development permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a development permit as prescribed in this Development Code without first obtaining said development permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the county. 
                  (c)  Monetary penalties. Any person who is determined by the court to have violated any provisions of this Development Code, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this Development Code, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the planning director issued as provided in this Development Code shall be liable for a civil penalty as follows: 
                  (1)  Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-15, the magistrate court shall be authorized to impose a penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which a violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation. 
                  (2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law as to penalties that can be assessed for violations of county laws, the court shall be authorized to impose monetary penalties for such violations in accordance with the maximum penalty provided by state law, but not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day the violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. 
                  (d)  Additional remedies. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the county from taking such other lawful actions as are necessary to prevent or remedy any violation, such as injunction, mandamus or other appropriate action. 
                  (e)  Administrative appeal/judicial review. 
                  (1)  Administrative remedies. The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by Barrow County upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan; or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions; or that the holder is in violation of any ordinance; shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to a hearing before the Barrow County Board of Commissioners within 60 days after receipt by the planning director of written notice of appeal. Unless enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction, all work must cease during the appeal process. 
                  (2)  Judicial review. Any person, aggrieved by a decision or order of the county board of commissioners, after exhausting his administrative remedies, shall have the right to appeal de novo to the Superior Court of Barrow County.

                  Sec. 89-1448. - Liability. 
                  (a)  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this Development Code, nor the issuance of a permit, nor the compliance with provisions of this Development Code, shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the county for damage to any person or property. 
                  (b)  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a development permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this Development Code or the terms of the development permit. 
                  (c)  No provision of this Development Code shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, as amended, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved under such laws or pollute any waters of the state as defined by said acts.

                  A.  To promote the general health, safety, and welfare of the community. 
                  B.  To improve the efficient operation of traffic around Barrow County. 
                  C.  To promote safe and efficient movement within the Overlay District for persons using all modes of travel - motorized vehicles, bicycles, and walking.

                  E.  To encourage innovative development projects that set standards for landscaping, open space, community design, and public amenities. 
                  F.  To establish consistent and harmonious design standards for public improvements and private property development within the Overlay District so as to unify the distinctive visual quality of the Highway Corridor. 
                  Sec. 89-1602. - Boundaries. 
                  This Article applies to land parcels of record within unincorporated Barrow County as depicted on Exhibit, "A" which is attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference. A listing of the parcels of property included within the Highway Corridor Overlay District is attached as Exhibit "C," and is hereby incorporated herein by reference. These boundaries are further depicted on the Barrow County Official Zoning Map adopted as amended on the date of adoption of this Ordinance, which is attached hereto as Exhibit "C" and incorporated herein by reference. All property contained within any parcel subject to this ordinance on the date of adoption of this Ordinance shall continue to be subject to this Article, even if the parcel is subdivided in the future. 
                  Upon written application pursuant to Article 13, the Board of Appeals may grant exemptions from these requirements for parcels or portions of a parcel that would otherwise be included in the Highway Corridor Overlay District, based on one or more of the following findings: 
                  A.  The subject property to be exempted lies more than 750 feet from the centerline of SR 124, SR11, 211, 53, 81 or 316 as applicable. 
                  B.  The property to be exempted does not have access to SR 124, SR 11, 211,53,81 or 316 as applicable and will not require access to SR 124, SR 11, 211, 53, 81 or 316, as applicable when developed. 
                  C.  Due to site topography, development of the property to be exempted will not be visible from SR 124, SR11, 211, 53, 81 or 316 as applicable. 
                  D.  Due to the location, size, and shape of the property, development of the parcel under its current zoning and in conformity with the requirements of the Highway Corridor Overlay District would present a severe and unique hardship. 
                  Sec. 89-603. - Effect of highway corridor overlay district provisions. 
                  A.  Application.

                  B.  Relationship to Underlying Zoning District Standards and Other Provisions of Unified Development Code. In any case where the standards and requirements of the Highway Corridor Overlay District conflict with those of the base-zoning district or with other provisions of the Unified Development Code, the standards and requirements of the Highway Corridor Overlay District shall govern. 
                  C.  Exceptions. The provisions of this Article shall not apply to the following: 
                  1.  Completion of work subject to preliminary plats, site development plans, construction plans, building permits, or interior finish permits approved prior to the effective date of this Article for those parcels not previously covered within the Highway overlay district previously known as the SR124 and 211 Corridor Overlay District.

                  4.  Construction, rehabilitation, restoration, repair of a non-residential structure, interior renovations or interior finishes within an existing structure, or addition to an existing non-residential structure that was permitted prior to the enactment of this Article for those parcels not previously covered within the Highway overlay district previously known as the SR124 and 211 Corridor Overlay District shall not be subject to the provisions of the Highway Corridor Overlay District, provided that such construction is on a lot of record and does not affect a change to more than 20 percent of the existing permitted structure or 5,000 square feet, whichever is less. 
                  D.  Building Plan Application. 
                  1.  All building plans submitted pursuant to an application for a building permit should clearly indicate all of the proposed building materials and colors for each facade as described in Section 1604(K) of this Article.

                  vii.  Glass; 
                  viii.  Exposed concrete block, metal, and tile are not allowed as building materials on a façade. 
                  b.  Ratios and Amounts of Allowed Building Materials. 
                  i.  Accent/Trim Exterior Building Material. Small amounts of building materials such as wood, tile, etc., may be used to enhance the facade of the building or for decorative elements, but should not exceed 10% of total wall area per facade. 
                  ii.  Facade Calculations. With the exception of accent/trim materials, there shall be no more than two primary building materials used. When stucco is used as a building material for a façade, it is restricted to 50% of the total. The allowed facade materials shall not apply to entry doors and/or roll-up doors. 
                  c.  The amount of permitted material shall be calculated using the gross square footage of wall area per façade. 
                  For example, a building has a front facade with a gross facade area of 1,200 square feet with 400 square feet consisting of windows and doors. Begin with 1,200 square feet for required building material calculations. A wall area of 1,200 square feet shall have no more than 600 square feet of stucco on the front facade [e.g. (1,200 X 50% = 600)]. The balance shall be brick or other allowed material. Trim or accent material may account for up to 10% or 120 square feet. 
                  3.  Roof Requirements. Materials for pitched roofs shall be limited to architectural dimensional grade asphalt shingles, natural slate, natural terra cotta, natural wood shake, copper or factory finished sheet metal.

If factory finished metal flashing is used, such as standing seam, the color must be subdued to blend with other materials or of a color to simulate weathered copper or bronze. All buildings with flat roofs should include parapet articulation on the front facade(s) of such building. There shall be roof articulations/offsets at a minimum of one per each 125 linear feet of length by a change in the top line of the parapet. Additional articulation may occur at any lesser distance. If the front facade is less than 125 linear feet of length, then a minimum of one roof articulation must occur. 
                  d.  Other. Drive under canopies for gasoline pumps may have flat roof with vertical or factory formed facing of finished sheet metal.

Stormwater, groundwater, rain water, street drainage, roof top drainage, basement drainage, subsurface drainage or yard drainage shall not be discharged through direct or indirect connections to a sanitary sewer. Under no conditions will sanitary sewage be discharged to a storm sewer. 
                  (c)  National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The categorical pretreatment standards found in 40 CFR, chapter I, subchapter N, (parts 405—471) are hereby incorporated. Certain industrial users are now or hereafter shall become subject to National Categorical Pretreatment Standards promulgated by the EPA specifying quantities or concentrations of pollutants or pollutant properties, which may be discharged into the POTW. All industrial users subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard shall also comply with any additional or more stringent limitations contained in this section. The provisions of this article shall not be deemed as alleviating, compliance with applicable state and federal regulations. Specific user charge and industrial cost recovery requirements, promulgated pursuant to the Act, shall be considered as a part of this article upon official adoption. All nonresidential users will be required to comply with pretreatment standards as outlined in 40 CFR, part 403. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in the wastewater, the chairman may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR section 403.6(c). When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the chairman shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR section 403.6(c). A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with 40 CFR section 403.13 and may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR section 403.15. 
                  (d)  State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this article. 
                  (e)  Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the national categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant specific limitation developed by the county and EPD. The chairman may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. Where necessary in the opinion of the county, equalizing may be required to bring constituents or volume to an acceptable level and to hold or equalize flows such that no peak flow conditions may interfere with the POTW. Said equalization or holding unit shall have a capacity suitable to serve its intended purpose, as stated above, and be equipped with acceptable outlet control facilities to provide flexibility in operation and accommodate changing conditions in the waste flow. 
                  (f)  Accidental or slug discharges. 
                  (1)  General. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include: 
                  a.  Location of discharge; 
                  b.  Type of waste discharged; 
                  c.  Concentration and volume; and 
                  d.  Corrective actions taken by the user. 
                  (2)  Written notice. Within five calendar days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the county a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this section or other applicable law. Noncompliance with this provision shall constitute a violation of section 90-114 and subject the permittee to the penalties described in that section. 
                  (3)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees to call the county sewer emergency phone number in the event of a discharge of any of the substances enumerated in subsection 90-113(a) of this article. 
                  (4)  Accidental discharge/slug control plan. At least once every two years, the chairman shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The chairman may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the chairman may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
                  a.  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
                  b.  Description of stored chemicals; 
                  c.  Procedures for immediately notifying the chairman of any accidental or slug discharge; and 
                  d.  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. 
                  (5)  Hazardous wastes. It is a violation of this article to discharge or cause to discharge any material identified as a hazardous waste by the May 19, 1980 Environmental Protection Agency Hazardous Waste Regulations, part 261 or any revision thereof. This prohibition extends to all wastes identified in subpart D regardless of the quantity of hazardous material stored or generated. 
                  (6)  Discharge to natural outlets, property, or storm drains. The discharge of any wastewater, sewage or polluted waters to any natural outlet or onto any public or private property shall be unlawful. The introduction of sanitary wastewater into a storm sewer system is prohibited.

Violators will be issued a citation requiring their appearance in the county magistrate court. 
                  (2)  A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a maximum penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day or imprisonment for not more than six months or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law. Violators will be issued a citation requiring their appearance in Barrow County Magistrate Court. 
                  (3)  A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this article, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than six months or both. Violators will be issued a citation requiring their appearance in the county magistrate court. 
                  (b)  Civil penalties. 
                  (1)  The discharge of wastewater or any other pollutant in violation of this section is hereby declared to be a public nuisance. 
                  (2)  The county may commence an action in the superior court or the county magistrate's court, or any other court of competent jurisdiction, a suit seeking to have the user's conduct declared a public nuisance, pursuant to applicable state law, or any other law, and further, seeking the issuance of an injunction to abate said nuisance and/or any other appropriate relief to enforce the provisions of this article and/or seeking penalties or damages. 
                  (3)  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the county for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000.00 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
                  (4)  The county may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the county. 
                  (5)  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
                  (6)  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
                  (7)  Right of entry—Inspection and sampling. 
                  a.  The chairman shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this article and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the chairman ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
                  b.  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the chairman will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
                  c.  The chairman shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
                  d.  The chairman may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at least annually to ensure their accuracy. 
                  e.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the chairman and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user. 
                  f.  Unreasonable delays in allowing the chairman access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article. 
                  (8)  Search warrants. If the chairman has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the chairman may seek issuance of a search warrant from the magistrate court of the county. 
                  (9)  Notice of violation. Whenever the chairman finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a CID permit issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the chairman may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the chairman. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of the chairman to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
                  (10)  Revocation of permit and/or termination of services. 
                  a.  Violations. In addition to any other action the county may take against a user for violations of the provisions of this article or a permit issued, pursuant to this article, the county may also revoke, amend or suspend the user's permit and/or terminate the user's connection to the POTW, by excluding the wastewater of the user for violations of this article or permits issued pursuant to this article. 
                  b.  Revocation or suspension of permit. Action by the county to revoke, suspend or amend the user's permit and/or terminate the user's sanitary sewer connection may be taken when the user commits any one of the following acts or allows any one of the following to occur: 
                  1.  A violation of the terms or conditions of this section occurs or a violation of any regulation issued, pursuant to this article; 
                  2.  The action is necessary to protect the county's POTW; 
                  3.  When the user has obtained a permit by misrepresentation or has failed to disclose fully all relevant facts; 
                  4.  A change in any condition that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the permitted discharge; 
                  5.  A violation of any term or condition of the CID permit issued by the county; 
                  6.  User discharges wastewater at an uncontrolled, variable rate in sufficient quantity to cause interference in the POTW; 
                  7.  User fails to pay bills for sanitary sewer services when due or a claim by the county; 
                  8.  User repeats a discharge of prohibited waste to the POTW; 
                  9.  The county is reliably informed or has reason to believe that the effluent from the POTW treatment plant is no longer of quality permitted for discharge to its water course, and it is found that the user is delivering wastewater to the POTW that cannot be sufficiently treated or the same requires treatment that is not provided by the county as a normal domestic treatment. 
                  10.  Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge. 
                  (11)  Notice. 
                  a.  The county, prior to any action as enumerated in subsection 90-114(b)10b. of this article, shall notify the user or his designated representative in writing, either by personal service or by certified mail return receipt requested at least ten calendar days prior to the hearing. 
                  b.  Said notice shall set forth the specific violation and/or the reason enumerated in the preceding section, for which revocation, amendment or suspension of the user's permit and/or termination of the user's connection to the county POTW is sought by the county.

Said decision shall set forth what action the county will take and the reason therefor. 
                  b.  The chairman is authorized to revoke, suspend or amend the user's county permit and/or terminate the user's connection to the county POTW upon finding as set forth in subsection 90-114(b)(10)(a) and (b). 
                  c.  Such action, as decided by the chairman, shall be taken only after the time for appeal has expired and shall continue until such time as the industrial customer or user provides additional pretreatment or other facilities designed to remove the interfering constituents from his wastewater and/or the reasons for the action have ceased to exist. 
                  (14)  Appeals. 
                  a.  Any user shall have the right to appeal a decision of the chairman to the county board of commissioners. The user must file the appeal in writing with the chairman, within ten days from the date of service of the county's decision made on the user. The user-appellant shall pay a filing fee, in advance, of $65.00. The board of commissioners can appoint a hearing board of five members. 
                  b.  No action shall be taken on the chairman's decision, and the appeal to the board shall be de novo. However, the appeal shall not stay any civil or criminal action initiated by the county against the user. 
                  c.  The chairman shall set the appeal for arbitration before the board to be held no later than ten days from the date of the filing of the appeal with the chairman. Notice of the time, place, and date of the hearing shall be mailed or delivered to appellant at least five days prior to the hearing. The board shall render a final and conclusive decision within ten days from the date of said arbitration before the board and serve a certified copy of said decision on the county and user within ten days from the date of the decision. 
                  d.  Decisions of the board shall be final and conclusive. Limited appeal may be sought through the superior court by certiorari on the record. The findings of the board will not be overturned unless found by the court to be contrary to law or unsupported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole or clearly unreasonable. 
                  (15)  Emergency termination of service. 
                  a.  In the event of an actual discharge or threatened discharge to the POTW of any pollutant which, in the opinion of the chairman, poses an immediate threat of serious irreparable harm to the public health, safety and welfare, either directly or indirectly through interference with the operation of the POTW, the chairman may immediately terminate sewer service and shall immediately notify the state EPD and the chairman of action taken and the nature of the emergency. 
                  b.  The chairman shall immediately make every reasonable effort to notify the user or other person causing the emergency and requesting their assistance in abating the same. 
                  c.  The county shall give notice to the user upon taking any action. Said notice shall conform in all respects to that required in subsection 90-114(b)(11). The county shall also immediately implement the procedures as enumerated in subsection 90-114(b)(10). The county may immediately terminate sewer service pending the decision of the board of commissioners. 
                  (16)  Assessment of damages to users. When a discharge of waste proximately causes an obstruction, damage or any other impairment to the POTW facilities of the county or any expense of whatever character or nature to the county, the chairman or his designated agent shall assess the expenses incurred by the county to clear the obstruction, repair damage to the facility, any other expenses or damages proximately caused to the county by the discharge. The county shall file a claim seeking reimbursement for any and all expenses or damages suffered by the county. If the claim is ignored or denied, the county shall notify its legal department to take such measures as shall be appropriate to recover for any expense or other damage suffered by the county. 
                  (17)  Petition for injunctive relief federal or state enforcement.

                  (18)  Consent orders. The chairman is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the discharger to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. 
                  (19)  Show cause hearing. 
                  a.  The chairman may order any industrial user who causes or is responsible for an unauthorized discharge or other violations to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action and the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any authorized representative of an industrial user. 
                  b.  At any hearing held pursuant to this article, testimony taken must be under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded, will be available to the public or any party of the hearing upon payment of charges for copying. Users rights to confidentiality, as defined in this section, shall be respected. 
                  c.  After the chairman has reviewed the evidence, he may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances shall have been installed and are properly operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued. 
                  (20)  Cease and desist orders. When the chairman finds that a discharge violates the prohibitions or effluent limitations of this article, or those contained in any permit issued hereunder, the chairman may issue an order to cease and desist, and direct those persons in noncompliance to: 
                  a.  Comply forthwith; 
                  b.  Comply with a time schedule set forth in the order; and/or 
                  c.  Take appropriate remedial or preventative action in the event of a continuing or threatened violation. 
                  (21)  Administrative penalties. 
                  a.  Any user in noncompliance with provisions of this article, or orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder, may be subject to a fine not exceeding $1,000.00 for each offense. Each day on which a violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. Such assessments may be added to the user's sewer service charges and the POTW shall have such remedies for the collection of such assessments as it has for collection of other service charges. 
                  b.  The county reserves the right to pass on the amount of any fine imposed on the county by federal or state agencies to the user, when an identified user's violation of this article causes a fine to be levied. This right also applies to any monetary settlements made by the county to satisfy federal or state agencies. The amount, which can be passed on to a user, found responsible would be in addition to the amount of other administrative penalties sought by the county. 
                  c.  Publication of users in significant noncompliance. The chairman shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the county, a list of the users, which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
                  (c)  Affirmative defenses to discharge violations due to upset. 
                  (1)  Definition. For the purposes of this subsection, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
                  (2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c)(3)c., below, are met. 
                  (3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
                  a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
                  b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures, and 
                  c.  The user has submitted the following information to the chairman within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset: 
                  1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
                  2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
                  3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days. 
                  (4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
                  (5)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
                  (6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
                  (d)  Affirmative defenses to discharge violations due to prohibited discharge standard violation. 
                  (1)  A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection 90-113(a)(1)—(15) of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
                  a.  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
                  b.  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the county was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
                  (e)  Affirmative defenses to discharge violations due to bypass. 
                  (1)  Definitions. For the purposes of this section: 
                  a.  Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
                  b.  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
                  (2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (e)(3) and (4), herein below. 
                  (3)  Advanced notice of bypass. 
                  a.  If a user knows in advance of the need to bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the chairman, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
                  b.  A user shall submit oral notice to the chairman of an anticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the bypass. The chairman may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
                  (4)  Bypass is prohibited. 
                  a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the chairman may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless; 
                  1.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
                  2.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
                  3.  The user submitted notices as required under subsection 90-114(e)(3). 
                  b.  The chairman may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the chairman determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection 90-114(e)(4).

                  Sec. 90-115. - CID permit, discharge reports and administration. 
                  (a)  County indirect discharge (CID) permit requirement. No new or existing significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the chairman, except that a significant industrial user that has filed a timely application pursuant to subsection 90-115(b) may continue to discharge for the time period specified therein. The chairman may require users other than SIU's to obtain CID permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this article. Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this article and subjects the CID permittee to the sanctions set out in section 90-114. Obtaining a CID permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements. 
                  (b)  CID application and permit requirements. All significant industrial users, prior to discharging process wastewater, shall submit an original and two copies of an application and engineering report to the county for the purpose of obtaining a CID permit. The original and copies of said package shall be submitted to the chairman for review and comment. The engineering report shall contain the information specified in section 90-115 hereof. The user shall submit to the county revised plans whenever alterations or additions to the user's premises deviate from the originally submitted plans. Any currently connected significant industrial user who has not heretofore filed such a report shall file same with the county no later than six months after the effective date of this article. The board of commissioners may initiate inquiries concerning plan revisions and process changes at six-month intervals. 
                  (c)  Permit application. The application and report required by subsection (b), above, or other provisions of this section 90-115 shall contain, in units and terms appropriate for evaluation, the following information.

                  (h)  Permission to discharge. Issuance of a CID permit by the county shall constitute permission by the county to discharge into the county POTW under the terms and conditions as enumerated in the CID permit. All users not required to operate under a CID permit, who currently contribute wastewater other than normal domestic sewage, and who discharge a rate in excess of 1,000 gallons per day shall comply with the provisions of section 90-117. 
                  (i)  Pretreatment facilities/compliance schedules. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in this section 90-115 within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or the chairman, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the chairman for review, and shall be acceptable to the chairman before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the county under the provisions of this article. 
                  (j)  Baseline report requirements. Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under 40 CFR, part 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to a POTW shall be required to submit to the chairman a report which contains the information listed in subsection 90-11(k) of this section. At least 90 days prior to commencement of discharge. New sources and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the chairman a report which contains the information listed in subsection 90-115(k)(1)—(5). 
                  New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in subsections 90-115(k)(4) and (5). New sources shall also be required to include in this report information on the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. 
                  (k)  Baseline report contents. 
                  (1)  Identifying information. The user shall submit the name and address of the facility including the name of the operator and owners; 
                  (2)  Permits. The user shall submit a list of any environmental control permits held by or for the facility; 
                  (3)  Description of operations. The user shall submit a brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classification of the operation(s) carried out by such industrial user. This description should include a schematic process diagram, which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
                  (4)  Flow measurement. The user shall submit information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from each of the following: 
                  a.  Regulated process streams; and 
                  b.  Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR, part 403.6(e). 
                  The chairman may allow for verifiable estimates of these flows where justified by cost or feasibility considerations. 
                  (5)  Measurement of pollutants. 
                  a.  The user shall identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process; 
                  b.  In addition, the user shall submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the standard or chairman) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations; 
                  c.  A minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where feasible. The board of commissioners may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. 
                  d.  The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph. 
                  e.  Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 CFR § 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR, parts 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the chairman; 
                  f.  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR, part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR, part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the chairman determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the chairman; 
                  g.  The chairman may allow the submission of a baseline report, which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures; 
                  h.  The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place, of sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW; 
                  (6)  Certification. A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the industrial user (as defined in section 90-111) and certified to by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O and M) and/or additional pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements; and 
                  (7)  Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O and M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards; the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O and M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. 
                  a.  Where the industrial user's categorical pretreatment standard has been modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR, part 403.7), the combined waste stream formula (40 CFR, part 403.6(e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR, part 403.13) at the time the user submits the report required by paragraph (b) of this section, the information required by subsection (b)(6) and (7) of this section shall pertain to the modified limits. 
                  b.  If the categorical pretreatment standard is modified by a removal allowance (40 CFR, part 403.7), the combined waste stream formula (40 CFR, part 403.6 (e)), and/or a fundamentally different factors variance (40 CFR, part 403.13) after the user submits the report required by subsection 90-115(b) of this article, any necessary amendments to the information requested by subsections (b)(6) and (7) of this section shall be submitted by the user to the chairman within 60 days after the modified limit is approved. 
                  (l)  Analytical and sampling requirements for demonstrating continued compliance. All analyses conducted for compliance purposes shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the Environmental Protection Agency under the provisions section 304(h) of the Act (33 U.S.C. § 1314(h)) and contained in 40 CFR, part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedure approved by the Environmental Protection Agency. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the environmental protection agency. Except as indicated below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the chairman may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
                  (m)  Signatory and certification requirements. All wastewater discharge permit applications and user reports must be signed by an authorized representative of the user and contain the following certification statement: 
                  "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations."

                  (1)  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of calendar dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment requirements for the industrial user to meet the applicable categorical standards (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc). 
                  (2)  No increment referred to in this subsection (n)(1) shall exceed nine months. 
                  (3)  Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report to the county including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for the delay, and steps being taken by the industrial user to return the construction to the schedule established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the county. 
                  (o)  Notification of changes to system. Each user must notify the chairman of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system, which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days before the change. The chairman may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a CID permit application. For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of two percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
                  (p)  Notification of violation. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the chairman within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the chairman within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the POTW monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the POTW samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
                  (q)  Maintenance of records. Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements established in this section shall maintain records of all information resulting from any monitoring activities required by this section. Such records shall include for all samples: 
                  (1)  The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the names of the persons taking the samples; 
                  (2)  The dates analyses were performed;

                  Sec. 90-119. - Determination of wastewater volume. 
                  Unless otherwise provided, the volume of wastewater delivered to the POTW will be based upon the quantity of water purchased from and metered by the customer's water provider. If the volume of water delivered to the POTW is greater or less than the volume purchased from the provider, the user shall make known to the county such differences. If differences do exist, it shall be the obligation of the user to install county-approved meters or other devices to determine the portion or quantity of wastewater delivered to the POTW. At locations readily accessible for meter reading by the county, separate water meters installed in the county right of way are preferred for measuring non-sewered consumptive water usage. The county may consider establishing a constant ratio, factor or percentage to be applied to the metered water quantity delivered by the water system in order to determine the waste delivered by the industry. Determining, as well as justifying, the factor to the county will be the responsibility of the user. The value of this factor may be periodically reviewed for accuracy by the county. Other methods may be established by the county to estimate the quantity of wastewater released to the sanitary sewer, which considers the amount of water consumed during different seasons. Users which claim wastewater volumes to be inaccurately determined by these methods shall bear the expense of installing county-approved meters to estimate flows to the POTW more accurately.

                  Sec. 90-125. - Sewer capacity allocation. 
                  (a)  Authorization to monitor and allocate capacity. The Barrow County Wastewater Department ("department") is authorized and directed to administer a system for tracking available capacity in each Barrow County sewer facility, determining whether sewer treatment facilities can serve proposed development, communicating the results of each determination to the person initiating a reservation request and, where available capacity exists, reserving capacity in sewer facilities. 
                  (b)  Definition of available capacity. For purposes of this section, "available capacity" means the permitted capacity of a sewer treatment facility (the maximum daily flow approved by applicable regulatory bodies) less the sum of: (a) the quantity of average daily sewer flow produced by current users of the facility and (b) the quantity of expected daily sewer flow that has been reserved for future use. 
                  (c)  Restrictions on reservation. The department may not offer or sell to the public a reservation of capacity in a facility that lacks available capacity, except where the department has determined that additional capacity will become available before the proposed development will require it. 
                  (d)  Reservation for county purposes. The department may set aside capacity for any reasonable purpose, including: 
                  (1)  To create a capacity buffer for times of unusually high flow; 
                  (2)  To ensure capacity is allocated in a balance between residential, commercial and industrial development at the county's sewer treatment facility(ies). 
                  (e)  Proof of capacity required for development. Before applying for a development permit, developers must reserve sufficient capacity to serve the entire proposed development. Developers shall provide proof of such reservation as part of any application for a development permit. 
                  (f)  Process for reserving capacity. 
                  (1)  Any person desiring to reserve sewer treatment capacity for property within an area receiving sewer services provided by Barrow County must submit a reservation application to the department on the forms prescribed by the department. The process for reserving capacity is the same for all property uses (i.e., residential, commercial, industrial). 
                  (2)  Applications shall be processed in the order received. Upon receipt of a completed application, the department shall determine whether there is sufficient available capacity in the applicable sewer treatment facility to meet the service requirements of the proposed development, and if not, whether available capacity will exist before the proposed development will require such capacity. 
                  (3)  If capacity is or will be available, an applicant may reserve sewer capacity by application and payment of the sewer capacity charge that is determined by the department and approved by the Barrow County Board of Commissioners. The sewer capacity charge will be the entire sewer reservation fee charged by the department for reserving capacity. 
                  (4)  When reserving sewer capacity, the applicant will be required to enter into a reservation agreement with Barrow County that will specify the county's requirements for sewer service, infrastructure, connection lines, easements, and the like. The reservation agreement will be in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit "A." 
                  (5)  The Barrow County Board of Commissioners authorizes the county manager to execute on behalf of Barrow County any number of reservation agreements consistent with the reservation agreement attached hereto as Exhibit "A" and consistent with the terms and conditions of this section. 
                  (6)  All fees shall be paid to the Barrow County Wastewater Department to facilitate the monitoring of allocated capacity. 
                  (g)  Transfer of reserved capacity. Capacity shall be reserved for a specific development site. No portion of any reserved capacity may be sold, transferred, or assigned to any other person or entity without the written consent of the Barrow County Board of Commissioners. Furthermore, no portion of any reserved capacity may be used for any property other than the specified development site without the written consent of the Barrow County Board of Commissioners. 
                  (h)  County's right to repurchase unused capacity. If the owner has failed to begin use of its reserved capacity within two years (as evidenced by failure to tap on to the county sewer system), the county may in its sole discretion elect to repurchase the entire reserved capacity by providing notice to the owner and returning the purchase price. If the owner has failed to fully use its reserved capacity within four years of purchase (as evidenced by fewer than the expected number of tap-ons to the county sewer system), the county may in its sole discretion elect to repurchase any unused capacity by providing notice to the owner and returning a pro-rated share of the purchase price. 
                  (i)  Forfeiture of reserved capacity. The reservation agreement may provide for forfeiture of reserved capacity in the event of the owner's non-responsiveness and failure to use the reserved capacity, or the owner's failure to respond to a repurchase notification, provided that due notice and opportunity to respond shall be given the owner before the forfeiture occurs. 
                  All policies, practices, resolutions, rules, and regulations in conflict with this section are hereby repealed. Any and all written contracts concerning the provision of sewerage capacity in effect prior to the adoption of this section shall remain in full force and effect, and shall not be amended or altered by virtue of the adoption of this section.

                  (4)  The county may require the owner or operator to install monitoring equipment and perform monitoring as necessary, and make the monitoring data available to the county. This sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the owner or operator at his/her own expense. All devices used to measure flow and quality shall be maintained and calibrated by the owner or operator to ensure their accuracy. 
                  (5)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the property or facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the owner or operator at the written or oral request of the county and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the owner or operator. If the owner or operator fails to remove the obstruction within five days of notice to remove it, the owner or operator shall be deemed to have consented to the county taking actions to remove the temporary or permanent obstruction, in which case, the county will assess the costs of such actions against the owner or operator in the same manner as assessments for the costs of abatement are treated in section 90-158. The owner or operator shall have the same rights of appeal as set forth in section 90-158 and shall likewise be subject to having a lien placed against the offending property. 
                  (6)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the county access to a facility for the purpose of such inspections is a violation of the provisions of this chapter. 
                  (7)  If the county has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and the county is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of the provisions of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with the provisions of this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, environment and welfare of the community, then the county may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

                  Sec. 90-192. - Notification of accidental discharges and spills. 
                  Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any responsible party has information of any known or suspected release of pollutants or non-stormwater discharges from that facility or operation which is resulting or may result in illicit discharges into the county's municipal separate storm sewer system, the responsible party shall immediately take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release so as to minimize the effects of the discharge. 
                  The responsible party shall notify the appropriate agency in person or by phone or facsimile within 24 hours of discovery of such release or discharge of the nature, quality and time of occurrence of the discharge. In the event of a release of hazardous materials, emergency response agencies and/or other appropriate agencies shall be immediately notified by the responsible party. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the county within three business days of the phone, facsimile or in person notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the responsible party of such establishment shall also make and retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years from the date of discovery of such release or discharge. The responsible party shall also take immediate steps to ensure that there is no recurrence of the discharge or spill. 
                  Failure to provide notification of a release as provided above is a violation of this article.

                  Sec. 90-216. - Conditions for granting a variance. 
                  (a)  The director of public works or his/her designee may grant a variance from the requirements of this article if exceptional circumstances applicable to a site exist such that strict adherence to the provisions of this article will result in unnecessary hardship and will not fulfill the intent of this article. Specifically, such variances may be granted in such individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon finding by the director or his/her designee that: 
                  (1)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular site in question; and 
                  (2)  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the impact on upstream and downstream properties; and 
                  (3)  The application of this article to this particular site would create an unnecessary hardship; and 
                  (4)  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular site involved; and 
                  (5)  Such conditions are not the result of any actions of the site owner; and 
                  (6)  Relief, if granted would not cause substantial detriment to the public good nor impair the purposes or intent of this chapter; and 
                  (7)  No variance may be granted for a site for any discharge that is prohibited by this article or which would result in a deterioration of quality of stormwater from a site greater than would otherwise be allowed if no variance were involved. 
                  (b)  A written request for a variance shall be submitted to the director of public works and shall state the specific variance sought and the reasons, with supporting data, that a variance should be granted. The request shall include all information necessary to evaluate the proposed variance. 
                  (c)  The director or his/her designee will conduct a review of the request for a variance within 30 calendar days of receiving the request and issue a decision. The applicant may appeal a denial of a variance request to the board of commissioners by submitting a written notice of appeal to the director of public works within ten days of the date of the decision. The decision of the board of commissioners shall be final.

                  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
                  The county means Barrow County, Georgia, and its board of commissioners and employees. 
                  Customers means all persons, properties, and entities served by and/or benefiting from the stormwater utility's acquisition, management, maintenance, extension, and improvement of the county stormwater management systems and facilities and regulation of other public and private stormwater management systems, facilities and activities related thereto, and persons, properties, and entities that will ultimately be served or benefited as a result of the county stormwater management systems. 
                  Developed land means any parcel that has more than 50 square feet of impervious surface located thereon. 
                  Fiscal year means July 1 of a calendar year to June 30 of the next calendar year. 
                  Hard structures include, but are not limited to, flumes, catch basins, drop inlets, outlet control structures, head walls, junction boxes, culverts, or curb and gutter used to convey stormwater. 
                  Impervious surface means hardened surface areas that either prevent or limit the natural entry of water into the underlying soil, resulting in stonnwater runoff. Rooftops, buildings, streets, parking lots, sidewalks, asphalt, concrete, other paving, driveways, decks, patios, and artificial turf include, without limitation, examples of impervious surfaces. 
                  Stormwater management systems means those systems, as further described herein, which address the issues of stormwater drainage management (flooding) and environmental quality (pollution, erosion and sedimentation) of receiving rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs through improvements, maintenance, regulation, and funding of plants, works, instrumentalities and properties used or useful in the collection, retention, detention, and treatment of stormwater or surface water drainage. 
                  Stormwater service fees means the annual fees established under this Article and imposed on owners of parcels or pieces of developed land to fund the costs of stormwater management services provided by the stormwater utility and the stormwater utility's operation, maintenance, and improvement of the county stormwater management systems. 
                  (Ord. of 3-22-2011; Ord. of 4-11-2017, § 8) 
                  Sec. 90-501. - Findings. 
                  (a)  Because Barrow County operates under the requirements of the NPDES Phase II Permit as well as federal and state statutory and regulatory mandates, including, but not limited to, the federal Clean Water Act, responsibility falls on the board of commissioners to provide function, personnel and means to comply with said requirements and mandates. 
                  (b)  It is appropriate, in order to facilitate the county's compliance with applicable federal and state stormwater laws and regulations, to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity, in the form of a utility to be named the Barrow County Stormwater Utility ("stormwater utility"), dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of county stormwater management systems in conjunction with other water resource management programs. 
                  (c)  The stormwater management systems, located in unincorporated Barrow County, include hard structures and soft structures, identified in the recorded legal descriptions (including deeds and plat) of private properties, providing conveyance of stormwater in prevention of flooding and assurance of water quality. 
                  (d)  The future usefulness of existing stormwater management systems managed and/or owned by Barrow County rests on the ability to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance such systems and facilities in the county in concert with management of other water resources. In order to do so, the county must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater utility operating and capital investment needs. 
                  (e)  The stormwater utility's management and regulation of stormwater management systems will assist the county in protecting the public health, safety and welfare of the environment and will result in both service and benefit to individual parcels, parcel owners, citizens and residents of the county in a variety of ways. 
                  (Ord. of 3-22-2011) 
                  Sec. 90-502. - Establishment of a stormwater utility and stormwater enterprise fund. 
                  (a)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility within and under the supervision of the county's Department of Stormwater Management, which stormwater utility shall be responsible for providing stormwater management services, for providing stormwater management systems and related facilities, and for determining labor, material and administrative fees for the operation of the County's stormwater management systems. 
                  (b)  The County Stormwater Enterprise Fund ("Stormwater Enterprise Fund"), established in 2008 to fund the operation of the county's stormwater management systems and performance of inspections of and repairs to county stormwater management systems, is hereby designated as a funding mechanism for the stormwater utility and shall continue to operate as a funding mechanism for the maintenance, repair and construction of county stormwater management systems. 
                  (c)  The Barrow County Board of Commissioners hereby transfers to the stormwater utility responsibility for stormwater services, county stormwater management systems and related facilities, and other related assets, including, but not limited to, properties upon which such facilities are located, and related easements, rights-of-entry and access rights. 
                  (d)  The Barrow County Finance Department shall maintain the stormwater enterprise fund in the county budget and accounting system, separate and apart from its general fund, for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the stormwater utility, including, but not limited to, rentals, rates, fees and licenses as may be established from time to time by the board of commissioners. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be deposited promptly upon receipt into the Stormwater Enterprise Fund, to be held and invested in trust and expended exclusively for the purposes of the stormwater utility, including but not limited to capital project construction. No other funds of the county shall be deposited in the Stormwater Enterprise Fund or commingled with dedicated stormwater utility funds, except that other revenues, receipts, and resources not accounted for in the Stormwater Enterprise Fund, including grants, loans, and bond proceeds, may be combined with and applied to stormwater utility capital projects as deemed appropriate by the board of commissioners, upon recommendation of the stormwater manager. 
                  (Ord. of 3-22-2011) 
                  Sec. 90-503. - Scope of responsibility for the county stormwater management systems. 
                  (a)  The county stormwater management system consists of all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, and other structures, natural or manmade, within the unincorporated political boundaries of the county, which control or convey stormwater and through which the county intentionally diverts surface waters from its public streets and properties. The county owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance and improvements to those segments of the stormwater management system that: 
                  (1)  Are located within county streets, rights-of-way or easements; 
                  (2)  Are subject to county easements, rights of entry, rights of access, rights of use, or other permanent rights of the county for adequate access for operation, maintenance and/or improvement of stormwater management systems and facilities; or 
                  (3)  Are located on public lands to which the county has adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of stormwater management systems and related facilities. Operation and maintenance of stormwater management systems and related facilities which are located on private property, or public property not owned by or otherwise accessible pursuant to written property rights to the county, and for which there has been no public dedication of such stormwater management systems and related facilities for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of such stormwater management systems and related facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the applicable property owner or occupant, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by the laws of either the state or federal government. 
                  (b)  It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of all properties and persons in the county in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the county.

                  Sec. 90-504. - Requirements for commercial on-site stormwater systems; enforcement methods and inspections. 
                  All owners and developers of developed commercial land within the county shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all federal, state, and county regulations. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by the county in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event a public nuisance is found to exist by the court, which nuisance the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the county may enter upon the property and cause such remedial work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property owner. From the date of the filing of such action, the county shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the Superior Court of the county. The county shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private property, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance with this section.

                  Sec. 90-505. - Determination and modification of stormwater service fees. 
                  Stormwater service fees shall be based upon impervious surface area and shall be determined and modified from time to time by resolution of the board of commissioners. In setting or modifying such rates, it shall be the objective of the board of commissioners to establish rates and fees that are fair and reasonable, which may include flat fee rates for certain classifications of properties, reflect the value of stonnwater management services and facilities to those properties that benefit therefrom and which, together with any other sources of revenue that may be made available to the stormwater utility, will be sufficient to meet the cost of budgeted programs, services and facilities including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on revenue bond obligations incurred for construction and improvements to the County Stormwater Management Systems. Future capital investments and necessary reserve accounts, including but not limited to an emergency reserve account, may be included in the calculation of the stormwater service fees.

                  Sec. 90-506. - Effective date of stormwater service fees. 
                  An annual service charge is imposed upon each parcel of developed land in the county as of July 1 each fiscal year, beginning October 1, 2008, to fund stormwater utility programs. This annual service charge shall be known as the "Stormwater Service Fee." Stormwater service fees shall be maintained in the Stormwater Enterprise Fund under the Barrow County Board of Commissioners. Purchases by the stormwater utility shall be made through the Department of Stormwater Management for the sole purpose of performing the obligations of the stormwater utility under applicable state and federal laws and regulations, including but not limited to the county's NPDES Phase II Permit and the conditions outlined therein. 
                  Stormwater service fees supporting stormwater utility needs will be determined for each fiscal year and will be approved by resolution during the budgeting process by the Barrow County Board of Commissioners.

                  Sec. 90-507. - Stormwater service fee billing, delinquencies, collections. 
                  (a)  A stormwater service fee bill shall be attached to and/or included in the annual tax bill generated by the Barrow County Tax Commissioner and issued through the U.S. Postal Service. The stormwater service fees are due as stated on said bill as well as past due late charges. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land, as shown from public land records of the County, shall be ultimately obligated to pay the stormwater service fee. If a customer is under-billed or if no bill is sent for developed land, the County may back-bill for a period of up to four years, but shall not assess penalties, other than the late charge described in subsection (b), for any delinquency. The inclusion of the stormwater services fee with the annual tax bill is intended for convenience only, such stormwater services fees being fees for utility services provided to customers by the stormwater utility and not a tax or regulatory fee. 
                  (b)  A one percent late charge per month shall be billed based on the unpaid balance of any stormwater service fee that becomes delinquent. 
                  (c)  Suits for collection of unpaid stormwater service fees shall be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction. No lien shall be imposed for delinquent collections unless a judgment is first obtained.

                  Sec. 90-508. - Requests for modification of the stormwater service fee. 
                  Any property owner may request a review of their stormwater service fee by submitting a request in writing, along with any supporting information, to the stormwater manager within 30 days after the date the tax bill is mailed or issued to the property owner. Grounds for modification of the stormwater service fee include, documentation and Barrow County personnel inspection verifying complete demolition and removal of all impervious surfaces on the parcel in question making up greater than 50 square feet of impervious surface area. A written response will be provided by the stormwater manager within 30 days of any request. All decisions of the stormwater manager shall be final. Any decision of the stormwater manager may be reviewed upon application for writ of certiorari before the superior court of Barrow County, filed within 30 days of the date of service of the decision.

                  Sec. 90-509. - Stormwater credit. 
                  A stormwater credit is a reduction in the stormwater service fee for properties that meet the following requirements. Such properties shall be eligible for a 40 percent reduction in the stormwater service fee. There shall be three categories of properties eligible for the stormwater credit, as follows: 
                  (1)  Residential properties with stormwater detention or retention facilities that are designed to properly manage the stormwater runoff from impervious surface areas in accordance with the stormwater criteria described in the current edition of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. For the purposes of the credit, the detention or retention facilities must be located on common areas of the residential development or incorporated into individual parcel platted within the subdivision and owned by the HOA. The credit will apply to the residential parcels within the development. 
                  (2)  Commercial properties with on-site stormwater detention or retention facilities that are designed to properly manage the stormwater runoff from impervious surface areas in accordance with the stormwater criteria described in the current edition of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
                  (3)  Properties used as a site for a public or private school, which school agrees to teach a general environmental science curriculum that includes water protection measures at the primary or secondary level. Recommended water protection programs include the Water Wise Program, the River Kids Program, Enviroscape Program, GLOBE (Global Learning and Observation to Benefit the Environment) Program or another such program approved by the stormwater manager, which will result in benefits to Barrow County as a result of teaching such program. Prior to the application deadline each year, the superintendent of the Barrow County School System, or in the case of private schools the chief executive officer of the school, shall certify to the stormwater manager the water protection measures curriculum being taught in each school for which an educational credit is being claimed; the grade levels, number of students, and percentage of total students being taught; and the number of contact hours. For purposes of this educational credit, a public school shall be any school operated by (1) the Barrow County School District or (2) a corporation or other legal entity holding a charter for such school from either the Barrow County School District or the State Charter Schools Commission, and a private school shall be a school operated by a private entity teaching some or all of the grades K through 12 at which are taught subject[s] commonly taught in the public schools operated by the Barrow County School District.

                  (3)  The application for any credit or adjustment must be in writing and must include the information necessary to establish eligibility for the credit or adjustment, any application fee, and be in the format established by the stormwater manager. Incomplete applications will not be accepted by the stormwater manager. 
                  (4)  Applicants that have on-site detention or retention must have an approved maintenance plan on file with the stormwater department. 
                  (5)  Applicants that have on-site detention or retention must have a licensed engineer complete section 2 of the application. 
                  (6)  When an application for a credit is deemed complete by the stormwater manager, the stormwater manager shall have 30 days from the date the complete application is accepted to grant or deny the credit. The applicant may appeal such determination by application for writ of certiorari before the superior court of Barrow County, filed within 30 days of the date of mailing of the decision of the stormwater manager. 
                  (7)  The application deadline for each year is July 1. Applications submitted after the deadline will be processed during the next billing cycle. Applicants that obtain a credit for on-site detention or retention shall not have to reapply annually for the credit granted. 
                  (8)  The stormwater manager may review the credit annually, and may terminate the credit if the stormwater manager determines that on-site detention or retention facilities are no longer in compliance with the current edition of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual or that the school is no longer teaching an environmental science curriculum that includes water protection programs approved by the stormwater manager. Properties no longer in compliance have 30 days to correct the deficiencies before such credit is terminated. If terminated, the applicant may, if possible, correct the deficiencies which caused the termination and reapply for the credit, or may appeal such determination by application for writ of certiorari before the superior court of Barrow County, filed within 30 days of the date of mailing of the decision of the stormwater manager.
