PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Sumter County, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Supervising Editor, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Barbara S. McCarty, Chief Administrative Officer, and Mr. George R. Ellis, Jr., County Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

(b)  All revenue bonds, notes, and other obligations shall be authorized by resolution of the authority, adopted by a majority vote of the directors of the authority present at a regular or special meeting. 
(c)  Revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bear such date or dates, shall mature at such time or times (not more than 40 years from their respective dates), shall bear interest at such rate or rates (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time), shall be subject to redemption on such terms, and shall contain such other terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions as the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other obligations may permit or provide. The terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions contained in or provided or permitted by any resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bind the directors of the authority then in office and their successors. 
(d)  The authority shall have power from time to time and whenever it deems it expedient to refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether or not the bonds to be refunded have matured, and may issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any other purpose permitted under this Act.

(e)  There shall be no limitation upon the amount of revenue bonds, notes, or other obligations which the authority may issue.

(g)  Bonds issued by the authority may be in such form, either coupon or fully registered, or both coupon and fully registered, and may be subject to such exchangeability and transferability provisions, as the bond resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or any indenture or trust agreement may provide. 
(h)  Bonds of the authority shall bear a certificate of validation. The signature of the clerk of the Superior Court of Sumter County may be made on the certificate of validation of such bonds by facsimile or by manual execution, stating the date on which such bonds were validated; and such entry shall be original evidence of the fact of judgment and shall be received as original evidence in any court in this state. 
(i)  With respect to the validation of bonds, in lieu of specifying the rate or rates of interest which bonds to be issued by the authority are to bear, the notice to the district attorney or the Attorney General, the notice to the public of the time, place, and date of the validation hearing, and the petition and complaint for validation may state that the bonds when issued will bear interest at a rate not exceeding a maximum per annum rate of interest (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) specified in such notices and petition and complaint or may state that, in the event the bonds are to bear different rates of interest for different maturity dates, none of such rates will exceed the maximum rate (which may be fixed or may fluctuate or otherwise change from time to time) so specified; provided, however, that nothing in this Act shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting the right of the authority to sell such bonds at a discount, even if in doing so the effective interest cost resulting therefrom would exceed the maximum per annum interest rate specified in such notices and in the petition and complaint. 
(j)  The terms "cost of the project" and "cost of any project" shall have the meaning prescribed in this Act whenever those terms are referred to in bond resolutions of the authority, in bonds, notes, or other obligations of the authority, or in notices or proceedings to validate such bonds, notes, or other obligations of the authority. 
Section 7. - Authorized contents of agreements and instruments of authority generally; use of proceeds; subsequent issues.

(b)  The proceeds derived from the sale of all bonds, notes, and other obligations issued by the authority shall be held and used for the ultimate purpose of paying, directly or indirectly, as permitted by this Act, all or part of the cost of any project, or for the purpose of refunding any bonds, notes, or other obligations issued in accordance with this Act. 
(c)  Issuance by the authority of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds, notes, or other obligations in connection with the same project or with any other projects; but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations are issued shall recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, mortgage, deed to secure debt, trust deed, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds, notes, or other obligations, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the authority to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations on a parity with such prior issue. 
Section 8. - Obligations of authority not public debt of state or political subdivision thereof. 
No bonds, notes, or other obligations of, and no indebtedness incurred by, the authority shall constitute an indebtedness or obligation of the State of Georgia or any county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision thereof, nor shall any act of the authority in any manner constitute or result in the creation of an indebtedness of this state or any county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision thereof. No holder or holders of any such bonds, notes, or other obligations shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the state or county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision thereof, nor to enforce the payment thereof against the state or any such county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision. 
Section 9. - Constitutional authority for enactment of Act; tax exemption. 
This Act is enacted pursuant to authority granted the General Assembly by the Constitution of Georgia. The authority is created for nonprofit and public purposes; and it is found, determined, and declared that the creation of the authority and the carrying out of its corporate purposes is in all respects for the benefit of the people of this state and that the authority is an institution of purely public charity and will be performing an essential governmental function in the exercise of the power conferred upon it by this Act; and for such reasons the state covenants with the holders from time to time of the bonds, notes, and other obligations issued under this Act that the authority shall not be required to pay any taxes of any kind or assessments imposed by this state or any counties, municipal corporations, political subdivisions, or taxing districts thereof upon any property acquired by the authority or under its jurisdiction, control, possession, or supervision or leased by it or others or upon its activities in the purchase, use, sale, disposition, operation, or maintenance of any such property or on any income derived by the authority in the form of fees, recording fees, rentals, charges, purchase price, installments, or otherwise; provided, however, that the leasehold interests of private parties leasing property from the authority shall be subject to the taxes or assessments imposed by this state or any counties, municipal corporations, political subdivisions, or taxing districts, unless they are specifically exempted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors of the authority. The bonds, notes, and other obligations of the authority, their transfer, and the income therefrom shall at all times be exempt from taxation within this state. Deeds to secure debt and similar instruments given and recorded to support or to secure the bonds, notes, or obligations of the authority or to support or to secure obligations pledged in support of the bonds, notes, or obligations of the authority shall be exempt from all intangibles, intangibles recording, and other taxation within this state. 
Section 10. - Construction of Act; applicability of the "Georgia Securities Act of 1973." 
This Act shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes hereof. The offer, sale, or issuance of bonds, notes, or other obligations by the authority shall not be subject to regulation under O.C.G.A. chapter 5, title 10, known as the "Georgia Securities Act of 1973."

The written consents and cooperative agreement, if required, provided for above shall be submitted to the Sumter County tax commissioner who shall certify whether subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (2) of this subsection, as applicable, have been satisfied with respect to each such proposed district. No district or board created under this Act shall transact any business or exercise any powers under this Act until the foregoing conditions are met. A copy of such resolutions shall be filed with the Secretary of State, who shall maintain a record of all districts activated under this Act, and with the Department of Community Affairs.

Section 5. - Administration and appointment of board members. 
(a)  Each district created pursuant to this Act which at the time of its creation or thereafter lies wholly within unincorporated Sumter County shall be administered by a five-member board appointed by the Board of Commissioners of Sumter County; provided, however, that so long as at least one member of the Americus-Sumter Payroll Development Authority, created pursuant to the provisions of an amendment to the Constitution of the State of Georgia contained in Ga. L. 1962, p. 933 and continued in Ga. L. 1987, pp. 3550, 5506, shall be appointed by the Board of Commissioners of Sumter County, the members of the board of each community improvement district created under this Act shall be the same as and shall serve terms co-extensive with the board of directors, as now or hereafter constituted, of the Americus-Sumter Payroll Development Authority. 
(b)  Each district created pursuant to this Act which at the time of its creation or thereafter lies wholly within an incorporated area in Sumter County or partially within unincorporated Sumter County and partially in an incorporated area of Sumter County shall be administered by a six-person board of which five members are appointed by the Board of Commissioners of Sumter County and one member is appointed by the governing body of each municipality within which the community improvement district wholly or partially lies; provided, however, so long as at least one member of the Americus-Sumter Payroll Development Authority is appointed by the Board of Commissioners of Sumter County, the five members of the board of each community improvement district to be appointed by the Board of Commissioners of Sumter County shall be the same as and shall serve terms co-extensive with the board of directors, as now or hereafter constituted, of the Americus-Sumter Payroll Development Authority; provided, further, that in the case of a district which lies wholly or in part within the City of Americus, that so long as at least one member of the Americus-Sumter Payroll Development Authority is appointed by the mayor and council of the City of Americus then such district shall be governed by a five-person board who shall be the same as and serve terms co-extensive with the members of the Americus-Sumter Payroll Development Authority.

Section 6. - Taxes, fees, and assessments. 
(a)  The board may levy taxes, fees, and assessments within the district only on real property used nonresidentially, specifically excluding property exempt from ad valorem taxation under the Constitution or laws of the State of Georgia and all property used for residential, agricultural, or forestry purposes and specifically excluding tangible personal property and intangible property. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall not exceed 2½ percent of the aggregate assessed value of all such real property; provided, further, that no tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall exceed any lesser limitation designated in the project specifications and that no tax, fee, or assessment shall be levied beyond any time limitation designated as provided in the project specifications. The taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be equitably apportioned among the properties subject to such taxes, fees, and assessments according to the need for governmental services and facilities created by the degree of density of development of each such property. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be used only for the purpose of providing the projects which are specially required by the degree of development and described in the project specifications and not for the purpose of providing those governmental services and facilities provided to Sumter County or the municipality as a whole. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall be collected by Sumter County if the district lies wholly or partly within the unincorporated area of Sumter County, and by the municipality within which it lies if it is wholly within a municipality, in the same manner as taxes, fees, and assessments are levied by Sumter County or the municipality, respectively. Delinquent taxes shall bear the same interest and penalties as Sumter County or municipal ad valorem taxes, respectively, and may be enforced and collected in the same manner. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments so levied shall be transmitted by Sumter County or the municipality which collect same to the board and shall be expended by the board only for the purposes authorized by this Act. 
(b)  The board shall levy the taxes provided in subsection (a) of this section between January 1 and June 1 each calendar year and notify in writing the collecting governing bodies by June 15 each year so they may include the levy on their regular ad valorem tax bills. 
(c)  If, but for this provision, a parcel of real property is removed from a district or otherwise would become nontaxable, it shall continue to bear its tax millage then extent upon such event, for bonded indebtedness of the district then outstanding, until said bonded indebtedness then outstanding is paid or refunded. 
Section 7. - Boundaries of the districts. 
(a)  The boundaries of each district shall be as designated as such by the Board of Commissioners of Sumter County if wholly within the unincorporated area of Sumter County and such municipalities within which the district may be partially located if partially within the unincorporated area of Sumter County and partially within one or more municipalities, or by the governing authority of a municipality if wholly within the incorporated are[a] thereof, as set forth in the resolutions required in Section 4 of this Act, or as may thereafter be added as hereinafter provided. 
(b)  The boundaries of a district may be increased after the initial creation of a district pursuant to the following: 
(1)  Written consent of: 
(A)  A majority of the owners of real property within the area sought to be annexed into the community improvement district which will be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the administrative body of the community improvement district; and 
(B)  The owners of the real property within the area sought to be annexed into the community improvement district which constitutes at least 75 percent by value of all real property within the area sought to be annexed into the community improvement district which will be subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the administrative body of the community improvement district; and for this purpose value shall be determined by the most recent approved county ad valorem tax digest; 
(2)  The adoption of a resolution consenting to the annexation by the board of the district; and 
(3)  The adoption of a resolution consenting to the annexation by the governing authorities of Sumter County, if any portion of the district is or is to be in the unincorporated area of Sumter County, and such municipalities as may have area within the district before or after the annexation.

Each district may incur debt without regard to the requirements of Section V of Article IX of the Constitution of Georgia, or any other provision of law prohibiting or restricting the borrowing of money or the creation of debt by political subdivisions of the State of Georgia, which debt shall be backed by the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the district but shall not be an obligation of the State of Georgia, Sumter County, or any other unit of government of the State of Georgia other than the district. 
Section 9. - Cooperation with local governments. 
The services and facilities provided pursuant to this Act shall be provided for in a cooperation agreement executed jointly by the board and the governing body of Sumter County and any municipalities within which the district is partially located. If the parties to the cooperation agreement so agree, the cooperation agreement may provide that such private persons as are designated by the district perform the actual construction or improvement of the services and facilities provided by the district. The provisions of this section shall in no way limit the authority of Sumter County or any such municipality to provide services or facilities within the district; and Sumter County or such municipalities shall retain full and complete authority and control over any of their facilities located within their respective areas of any district. Said control shall include but not be limited to the modification of, access to, and degree and type of services provided through or by facilities of the municipality or Sumter County. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to limit or preempt the application of any governmental laws, ordinances, resolutions, or regulations to the district or the services or facilities provided therein.

The district may issue notes only to provide funds which would otherwise be provided by the issuance of the bonds as validated. The notes may be authorized, sold, executed, and delivered in the same manner as bonds. As with its bonds, the district may sell such notes at public or private sale. Any resolution or resolutions authorizing notes of the district or any issue thereof may contain any provisions which the district is authorized to include in any resolution or resolutions authorizing bonds of the district or any issue thereof; and the district may include in any notes any terms, covenants, or conditions which it is authorized to include in any bonds. Validation of such bonds shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of the notes, but it shall not be required that such notes be judicially validated.

The terms, provisions, covenants, assignments, and conditions contained in or provided or permitted by any resolution of the board authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or other obligations shall bind the board members of the district then in office and their successors. 
(d)  The board shall have power from time to time and whenever it deems it expedient to refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether or not the bonds to be refunded have matured, and may issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any other purpose hereunder. The refunding bonds may be exchanged for the bonds to be refunded, with such cash adjustments as may be agreed upon, or may be sold and the proceeds applied to the purchase or redemption of the bonds to be refunded. 
(e)  There shall be no limitation upon the interest rates or any maximum interest rate or rates on any bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district; and the usury laws of this state shall not apply to bonds, notes, or other obligations of these districts. 
(f)  Bonds issued by a district may be in such form, either coupon or fully registered, or both coupon and fully registered, and may be subject to such exchangeability and transferability provisions as the bond resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or any indenture or trust agreement may provide.

Bonds shall bear a certificate of validation. The signature of the clerk of the Superior Court of Sumter County shall be made on the certificate of validation of such bonds by facsimile or by manual execution, stating the date on which such bonds were validated; and such entry shall be original evidence of the fact of judgment and shall be received as original evidence in any court in this state.

(i)  The terms "cost of the project" and "cost of any project" shall have the meaning prescribed herein whenever those terms are referred to in bond resolutions of a board, in bonds, notes, or other obligations of the district, or in notices or proceedings to validate such bonds, notes, or other obligations of a district. 
Section 12. - Authorized contents of agreements and instruments of the board generally; use of proceeds of sale of bonds, notes, etc.; subsequent issues of bonds, notes, etc. 
(a)  Subject to the limitations and procedures provided by this section and by Section 11 of this Act, the agreements or instruments executed by a board may contain such provisions not inconsistent with law as shall be determined by such board. 
(b)  The proceeds derived from the sale of all bonds, notes, and other obligations issued by a district shall be held and used for the ultimate purpose of paying, directly or indirectly as permitted in this Act, all or part of the cost of any project, or for the purpose of refunding any bonds, notes, or other obligations issued in accordance with this Act. 
(c)  Issuance by a board of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds, notes, or other obligations in connection with the same project or with any other projects; but the proceedings wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations are issued shall recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds, notes, or other obligations, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the board to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations on a parity with such prior issue. 
Section 13. - Construction; applicability of O.C.G.A. chapter 5, title 10, known as the "Georgia Securities Act of 1973"; notice, proceeding, publication, referendum. 
This Act shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes hereof. The offer, sale, or issuance of bonds, notes, or other obligations by a district shall not be subject to regulation under O.C.G.A. chapter 5, title 10, known as the "Georgia Securities Act of 1973." No notice, proceeding, or publication except those required by this Act shall be necessary to the performance of any act authorized by this Act, nor shall any such act be subject to referendum. 
Section 14. - Termination. 
So long as a district has no debt outstanding the board of a district may terminate and dissolve the district as of a certain date; and on such date all property, rights, and obligations of the district shall devolve to Sumter County, unless the district shall lie wholly within an incorporated area, in which case the property rights and obligations of the district shall devolve to the municipality in which the district shall lie.

(h)  Bonds of the authority shall bear a certificate of validation. The signature of the clerk of the Superior Court of Sumter County may be made on the certificate of validation of such bonds by facsimile or by manual execution, stating the date on which such bonds were validated; and such entry shall be original evidence of the fact of judgment and shall be received as original evidence in any court in this state.

(j)  The terms "cost of the project" and "cost of any project" shall have the meaning prescribed in this Act whenever those terms are referred to in bond resolutions of the authority, in bonds, notes, or other obligations of the authority, or in notices or proceedings to validate such bonds, notes, or other obligations of the authority.

(c)  Issuance by the authority of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds, notes, or other obligations in connection with the same project or with any other projects; but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations are issued shall recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, mortgage, deed to secure debt, trust deed, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds, notes, or other obligations, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the authority to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations on a parity with such prior issue. 
Section 6. - Obligations of authority not public debt of state or political subdivision thereof. 
No bonds, notes, or other obligations of, and no indebtedness incurred by, the authority shall constitute an indebtedness or obligation of the State of Georgia or any county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision thereof, nor shall any act of the authority in any manner constitute or result in the creation of an indebtedness of this state or any county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision thereof. No holder or holders of any such bonds, notes, or other obligations shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the state or county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision thereof, nor to enforce the payment thereof against the state or any such county, municipal corporation, or political subdivision.

Claim includes all claims presented against an employee prior to institution of a proceeding. 
Employee means the members of the governing body of the county, employees of the county, elected or appointed county officers and their appointees and employees, including appointed members of county commissions, past, present, and future. The term "employee" does not include employees of the county board of health, the livestock authority, the recreational authority, or the airport authority. 
Proceeding includes any matter of a civil nature in or before any court or agency of this state or of any other state or of the United States. 
(b)  Exclusions. There is excluded further from the operation of this section any claim or proceeding as to which insurance is provided by the county. 
(c)  Construction. Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to constitute any waiver, by the county or by any employee, of the governmental immunity afforded it under the constitution and laws of the state. The county and its employees specifically reserve the right to assert their immunity prior to the entry of judgment in any claim or proceeding, and subsection (f) shall not be applicable to require the county or any employee to pay any sums based on claims from which the county and its employees are immune. Nothing contained herein shall be interpreted in any way to reduce or eliminate the rights of any employee of the county against any other party. 
(d)  Defense of employees. Whenever any claim is made or proceeding is brought against any employee, either against him asserting personal liability for damages arising out of the performances of his duties or in any way connected therewith, whether based on negligence, violation of contract rights or violation of civil, constitutional, common law or other statutory rights, whether federal, state or local, the county shall, upon his written request, provide for his defense unless otherwise limited by the terms of this section. The board of commissioners of the county may decline defense of an employee or decline payment of a claim against an employee if the employee has failed to give notice in writing of any claim or proceeding to the board within 30 days after the employee has notice of a claim or if the employee has failed to give such notice within five days after service of a proceeding. 
(e)  Grounds for refusal of defense. 
(1)  The county shall refuse to provide the defense of a claim or proceeding brought against an employee if it determines that: 
a.  The act or omission did not arise out of and in the course of his employment. 
b.  The employee acted or failed to act because of actual or intentional misconduct, fraud, corruption, malice or in bad faith. 
c.  The proceeding is a criminal prosecution. 
d.  Provisions of a defense against the claim or proceeding would not be in the best interest of the county. 
e.  The employee acts or fails to act as a result of, or at a time when, the employee's own self-indulgence substantially impaired the employee's judgment (as, for example, an officer or employee who causes damage or injury while intoxicated or under the influence of drugs while on the job). 
f.  The employee acts or fails to act, except in emergencies or the existence of extenuating circumstances, directly contrary to advice of the county attorney or safety personnel. 
g.  The employee acts or fails to act in such manner as to constitute a criminal act (as, for example, misappropriation of property or funds). 
h.  The employee fails to cooperate in the defense of the claim or proceeding. 
i.  The employee acted or failed to act in willful disregard of county policy or specific instructions of the employee's supervisor. 
(2)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the county from providing a defense against a claim or proceeding where there is a conflict of interest between one employee or group of employees of the county as compared with another employee or group of employees. 
(3)  The determinations required by subsection (1) of this subsection (e) shall be made by the board of commissioners of the county. The commissioners will make this decision upon the advice of the county administrator, the county attorney, and department heads, and upon any internal investigation of the claim or proceeding. The commissioners may refuse at any time, prior to, or after approval of assumption of the defense, to provide for the defense of an employee if it is determined that any of the grounds for refusal set forth in this section exists. 
(4)  Upon approval of the defense of a claim or proceeding against an employee, the board of commissioners of the county shall refer the matter to the county attorney for disposition. In the event two or more employees or groups of employees are involved, and the interest of one employee or group of employees conflict with the interest of another employee or group of employees, then and in such event, the board of commissioners of the county shall specify which employee or group of employees shall be represented by the county attorney and shall authorize other employees or groups of employees to employ counsel at the expense of the county; provided, however that the selection and compensation of such other counsel shall be subject to the prior approval by the board of commissioners of the county. 
(f)  Payment of judgments, settlement of claims. 
(1)  Where defense of a claim or proceeding against an employee is provided by this section, all final judgments awarded in courts of competent jurisdiction against the employee in proceedings to which this section applied or any amount payable under any settlement of such proceeding or of claims in accordance with this section shall be paid by the county as hereinafter provided. All compromises of claims or proceedings governed by this section shall be submitted to the board of commissioners of the county for its prior approval. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment of judgments and claims shall be limited as follows: 
a.  No sum will be paid where the employee's liability is based on a discretionary act, and the county and the employee reserve the right to assert all governmental and sovereign immunity in defense of such claims. Payment of judgments and claims pursuant to this section shall be made only where liability is based upon a ministerial act of the employee. It is the intent of this section to provide for the payment of claims or judgments only where the defense of sovereign or governmental immunity may not be asserted initially as a defense to the claim or proceeding. 
b.  No sum will be paid in any one claim or proceeding on behalf of any employee in excess of $50.00 in the case of any claim or claims brought by one claimant, and $200.00 for any number of claims of numerous claimants arising out of the same occurrence. 
c.  No sum will be paid under the provisions of this section for punitive or exemplary damages. 
d.  No sum shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant unconditionally releases the employee and the county from any and all claims, causes of action or judgment arising out of the subject claim or proceeding. 
e.  There is excluded further from the operation of this section any claim or proceeding as to which insurance is provided by the county. There is further excluded from the operation of this division any claim or proceeding as to which the county has, by resolution or otherwise, provided for the payment and defense of claims or proceedings arising from the ownership, use or maintenance of county motor vehicles.

ARTICLE III. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS 

Sec. 6-97. - Findings; public purpose. 
(a)  Based on the demonstrated experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including but not limited to Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Orlando, Florida; Orange County, Florida; Indianapolis, Indiana; Los Angeles, California; Beaumont, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Austin, Texas, which experience is found to be relevant to similar problems that could face Sumter County. 
(b)  It is the finding of the Board of Commissioners of Sumter County that public nudity (either partial or total) under circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment" in conjunction with the sale of alcoholic beverages, enhances criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. 
(c)  Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public indecency and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the concentration of adult entertainment establishments are depreciation of property values in neighborhoods surrounding nude bars or adult entertainment establishments where alcoholic beverages are sold, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burdens on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of adult establishments in particular areas. 
(d)  Other negative effects which were found by the board are the apparent connection of these establishments to organized crime and illegal drug sales; the potential spread of communicable disease to law enforcement personnel who answer calls at adult establishments and to patrons of such establishments; and the potential proliferation of adult entertainment establishments after the initial opening of an adult entertainment establishment in a particular neighborhood. 
(e)  The board, therefore, finds that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals and preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, and parks to prevent the adverse impact of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the board finds that the prohibition of live nude conduct establishments licensed to serve alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare of furthering legitimate governmental interest, such as reducing criminal activity, protecting against property devaluation and deterioration, and eliminating undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and allow and/or encourage nudity, and that such prohibition will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech and/or expression. 
(Ord. of 6-15-10) 
Sec. 6-98. - Conduct prohibited. 
The following types of entertainment, attire and conduct are prohibited upon any premises licensed to sell, serve or disperse alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises within unincorporated area of the county. 
(1)  The employment or use of any person live, in any capacity, in the sale or service of alcoholic beverages or food while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing, as to expose any portion of his or her specified anatomical areas. 
(2)  Live entertainment where any person appears unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing as to expose any portion of his or her specified anatomical areas or where such person performs acts of specified sexual activities or acts which simulate specified sexual activity, as defined herein. 
(3)  The holding, promotion, sponsoring or allowance of any contest, promotion, special night, event or any other activity where live patrons of the licensed establishment are encouraged or allowed to engage in any of the conduct proscribed in subsections (1) and (2) above. 
(4)  Nothing contained in this section shall apply to the premises of any mainstream performance house or museum which derives less than 20 percent of its gross annual income from the sale of alcoholic beverages. 
(Ord. of 6-15-10) 
Sec. 6-99. - Penalties. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to perform any acts prohibited in section 6-98 above and any such conduct will be a violation of this Code and shall be punishable as provided under section 1-11 of this Code. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for a licensee to permit any conduct prohibited in section 6-98 above which he knows or has reasonable cause to know is taking place on the premises. Any such conduct by a licensee shall be a violation of this Code and shall be punishable as provided under section 1-11 of this Code. Also, upon conviction, a licensee may have his/her alcoholic beverage license revoked or suspended as provided in section 6-73 of this Code.

Sec. 10-31. - Findings; public purpose. 
Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including but not limited to Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; Dekalb County, Georgia; Cobb County, Georgia; Richmond County, Georgia; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the county, the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within the country are noted. Moreover, it is the finding of the board of commissioners that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare; and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments that serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.

(2)  Live entertainment where any person appears in the manner described in subsection (1) of this section or where such person performs acts of or acts that simulate any of the following: 
a.  Sexual intercourse, masturbation, sodomy, bestiality, oral copulation, flagellation or any sexual act prohibited by law.

(Ord. of 10-19-2010(1)) 
Sec. 34-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsection 34-34(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsection 34-34(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
(2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code [O.C.G.A.] § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 34-34(b)(2) of this article; 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection 34-34(b) and (c) of this article. 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. of 10-19-2010(1)) 
Sec. 34-35. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Sumter County Board of Commissioners without first obtaining a permit from the Sumter County Code Enforcement Office to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the Sumter County Code Enforcement Office and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 34-35(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsection 34-34(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
(3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsection 34-34(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 34-35(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsection 34-34(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the Division and the Stakeholder Advisory Board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20.

The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsection 34-34(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 34-35(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

Sec. 34-36. - Inspection and enforcement. 
(a)  The Sumter County Code Enforcement Office will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 34-71. - Purposes. 
The Sumter County Board of Commissioners hereby declare that it is important for the unincorporated areas of Sumter County to appear clean, well kept, and generally clear of public nuisances, eyesores, and unhealthy conditions. The appearance of said community weighs heavily in the decisions of prospective residents and businesses in locating to a particular area. A clean, safe, drug free and well-kept community can stabilize or increase property values, provide a healthy environment, and make citizens proud of the area in which they live. Accordingly, Sumter County needs a set of regulations to keep the area clean, remove unsightly conditions, prevent illicit drug use and prevent unhealthy and unsafe situations from occurring. It is therefore the purpose and intent of this article to encourage a clean, healthy, and satisfying environment; one free of nuisances, eyesores, and unhealthy, unsafe, or devaluating conditions. To this end, this article seeks to regulate and protect the health, safety, welfare, values, and aesthetics of properties. 
(Ord. of 9-15-09(1)) 
Sec. 34-72. - Definition. 
A "nuisance" is anything within the county that causes hurt, inconvenience or damage to another and the fact that the act done may otherwise be lawful shall not keep it from being a nuisance. The inconvenience complained of shall not be fanciful, or such as would affect only one of fastidious taste, but it shall be such as would affect an ordinary, reasonable person. Any such nuisance may be abated as provided in this article.

Sec. 34-91. - Board up permits. 
(a)  No person, firm, association or corporation shall erect, install, place, or maintain boards over the doors, windows, or other openings of any building or structure or otherwise secure such openings by a means other than the conventional method used in the original construction and design of the building or structure without first applying for and, within 30 days of application, completing all steps necessary for the issuance of a boarding permit and thereafter having a valid and current boarding permit therefore from the building official. Any properties with boards existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived will have one year from the date of the ordinance's adoption to make application to continue to board. 
(b)  Code enforcement shall issue a boarding permit required by subsection (a) upon the submission of a written application by the owner of the property or his/her authorized representative or contractor, upon the payment of the required fee and upon the confirmation through inspection by the director of code enforcement or his/her designee that the boarding or other method of securing the building or structure has been done in compliance with this article. Code enforcement is authorized to establish a fee schedule so as to enable the county to offset its reasonable expenses in reviewing the application and monitoring the boarding process. 
(c)  The boarding permit issued pursuant to this section shall authorize the boarding or other securing of a building or structure for an initial period of six months. If the structure is still boarded at the end of each such six months, the boarding permit may be renewed upon the submission of a written application by the owner of the property or their authorized representative or contractor with the submission of the application occurring no later than ten business days prior to the expiration of the original permit, upon the payment of the required fee and upon the confirmation through inspection by a county code enforcement officer that the boarding or other method of securing the building or structure has been done in compliance with this article. The issuance of a renewal-boarding permit shall also be subject to all of the following conditions: 
(1)  The owner shall submit a detailed plan for correction, repair or rehabilitation of violations of state or local building and housing standards and for the securing of the doors, windows and other openings by the conventional method used in the original construction and design of the building or structure or, alternatively, a detailed plan for sale of the property to another person or entity with provision in the sale of correction, repair or rehabilitation; and 
(2)  The owner shall submit a time line for applying for appropriate permits for such work and for completing such work prior to the expiration of the renewal permit, or alternatively, a time line for the sale of the property; 
(3)  The permit may be revoked by written notice of code enforcement, at the recommendation of the director of code enforcement, if the owner fails to comply with the plan for such work or fails to comport to the time line submitted. 
(d)  A boarding permit may not be extended beyond the renewal period nor may a new application for the same property be accepted by code enforcement within one year of the date of expiration of the prior permit, except upon the submission of a written application by the owner of the property or their authorized representative or contractor, upon the payment of the required fee, upon the confirmation through inspection by a county code enforcement officer that the boarding or other method of securing the building or structure has been done in compliance with this chapter and upon demonstration that "good cause" for the renewal exists. "Good cause" shall require a showing by the owner that the permit renewal is made necessary by conditions or events beyond the owner's control, such as inability to obtain financing for repair or rehabilitation, inability to locate a suitable buyer, unanticipated delays in construction or rehabilitation, or unanticipated damage to the property. In addition, where appropriate, "good cause" shall also require a showing by the owner that the owner has exercised reasonable and due diligence in attempting to complete the needed repair, rehabilitation or correction or is attempting to sell the property. In the event that the director of code enforcement determines that there exists good cause to renew the permit and that all other conditions are met, the permit may be renewed by the owner for an additional one year, subject to all of the same conditions imposed on the original renewal permit. 
Exceptions. Board up permit shall not be required in the following circumstances: 
(1)  Temporary emergency situations, including but not limited to damage caused by vandalism, theft or weather and hurricane preparation.

ARTICLE V. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION ORDINANCE[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. of 12-19-00(1), §§ 1—9, 11, did not specifically amend this Code. Hence, inclusion of said ordinance provisions as art. V, §§ 34-126—34-135 was at the editor's discretion. The appendix is not included herein but is available for public inspection in county offices. 

Sec. 34-126. - Title of the article, findings and objectives. 
(a)  Title of article. This article shall be known as the Groundwater Recharge Area Protection Ordinance of Sumter County, Georgia. 
(b)  Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and to promote a healthy economic climate in Sumter County and surrounding communities, it is essential that public drinking water resources of high quality be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources Sumter County and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. 
Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas to ensure that pollution threats to water resources are minimized. 
(c)  Objectives. The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use, or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
(2)  Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and 
(3)  Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality. 
(Ord. of 12-19-00(1), §§ 1—1.3) 
Sec. 34-127. - Establishment of groundwater recharge area district. 
A groundwater recharge area district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands in unincorporated Sumter County, Georgia, outside the Cities of Americus, Andersonville, DeSoto, Leslie and Plains, that are mapped and designated as significant recharge areas by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. 
(Ord. of 12-19-00(1), § 2) 
Sec. 34-128. - Determination of pollution susceptibility. 
Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium or low based on the groundwater pollution susceptibility map prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. 
(Ord. of 12-19-00(1), § 3) 
Sec. 34-129. - Permit requirements and enforcement. 
No building permit, rezoning request or subdivision plan will be approved by the permitting officer unless the permit, request and/or plan is in compliance with the groundwater protection standards listed herein. 
(1)  Enforcement. The permitting officer, his agent, officers and employees shall have authority to enter upon privately owned land for the purpose of performing their assigned duties and responsibilities under this article, and may take or cause to be made such examinations, surveys or sampling as the permitting officer deems necessary. 
a.  The permitting officer may require a bond with surety and conditions sufficient to secure compliance with the conditions set forth in the permit. The particular amount and conditions of the bond shall be consistent with the purposes of this article. In the event of a breach of any condition of any such bond, the permitting officer may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction upon such bond and prosecute the same to judgment and execution. 
b.  The permitting officer shall have authority to enforce this article; issue permits hereunder; and address violations or threatened violations hereof by issuance of violation notices, administrative orders and civil and criminal actions. All costs, fees and expenses in connection with such actions may be recovered as damages against the violator.

Sec. 34-135. - Definitions. 
[The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
Groundwater recharge area (synonymous with aquifer recharge area) means an area of the Earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer. 
Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities. 
Pollution susceptibility map(s) means maps prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by DNR in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces.

ARTICLE VI. - RIVER CORRIDOR PROTECTION ORDINANCE[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. of 12-19-00(2), §§ 1—11, did not specifically amend this Code. Hence, inclusion of said ordinance provisions as art. VI, §§ 34-151—34-161 was at the editor's discretion. 

Sec. 34-151. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  The State of Georgia has determined river corridors are of vital importance to the quality of life in the state in that they help preserve those qualities that make a river suitable as a habitat for wildlife, a site for recreation, and a source for clean drinking water. River corridors are fragile natural resources subject to flood, erosion, soil-bearing capacity limitation, and other natural and human induced hazards. In their natural state they serve multiple functions, including pollution control, aquifer recharge and discharge, storage and passage of flood water, erosion and sedimentation control, as well as wildlife habitat, education, scientific study, open space and recreation, and scenic and aesthetic beauty. 
The state's Comprehensive Planning Act of 1989 provided for coordinated and comprehensive planning by municipal and county governments, including consideration for the natural resources, environments, and vital areas within their jurisdictions. The O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 authorized the department of natural resources to develop minimum planning standards and procedures for the protection of river corridors in the state, and requires local governments to use these minimum standards in developing and implementing local comprehensive plans. The method mandated in O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8 for protecting river corridors is establishment of a natural vegetative buffer bordering each protected river. 
(b)  This article shall be known as the River Corridor Protection Ordinance of Sumter County, Georgia. The purposes of this article are to provide for protection of the river corridor along the Flint River and Kinchafoonee Creek by regulating activities in or adjacent to the corridor; provide for the powers and duties of Sumter County; provide goals, guidelines, practices, procedures, policies, rules, and regulations; provide minimum standards for regulated activities within the river corridor; provide for a review of decision; provide for hearings and judicial review; provide for enforcement; prohibit certain activities or actions; provide for civil and other penalties; repeal conflicting ordinances; and other purposes.

(Ord of 12-19-00(2), §§ 9—9.2.3) 
Sec. 34-160. - Definitions. 
For purposes of this article, the terms listed below shall be defined as follows: 
Board means Sumter County Board of Commissioners. 
Buffer or buffer area: See "river corridor". 
Comprehensive plan means The Comprehensive Plan for Sumter County, and as may be amended. (NOTE—The plan needs to be amended for purposes of this article). 
Contaminant means any "regulated substance," as defined by the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as in effect on the date of passage of this article [December 19, 2000] and as amended from time to time, and all petroleum products, including gasoline, oil, waste oils, and other fuels as well as their hazardous constituents. 
County means Sumter County, Georgia. 
Hazardous material means any "contaminant" as defined in this article, and any hazardous chemical for which a material safety data sheet must be filed in 42 USC 11021 and 11022. 
Hazardous waste means any solid waste which has been defined as a hazardous waste in regulations promulgated by the administrator of the United States Environment Protection Agency according to federal act, which are in force and effect on February 1, 1988, codified as 40 CFR § 261.3. 
Land-disturbing activity means any grading, scraping, excavating, or filling of land; clearing of vegetation; and any construction, rebuilding, or alteration of a structure. Land-disturbing activity shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, individual home gardens, yard and grounds upkeep, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single-family dwelling, or the cutting of firewood for personal use. 
Natural vegetative buffer or buffer area means a river corridor containing the flora native to that area. The natural floras for specific areas are described in Georgia Geologic Survey Bulletin 114, "The Natural Environments of Georgia." Habitats for endangered and threatened species may require human management of the river corridor in order to maintain those species. 
Perennial river means a river or section of a river that flows continuously throughout the year. 
Person means any individual, group of individuals, association, firm, partnership, corporation, trust, estate, organization, or legal entity of any kind, including municipal corporations, government agencies, or subdivisions thereof. 
Protected river means any perennial river or watercourse with an average annual flow of at least 400 cubic feet per second as determined by appropriate U.S. Geological Survey documents. By this definition, the Flint River and Kinchafonnee Creek in Sumter County are protected rivers. 
Public utility or utilities means a service or services provided by a public utility company or a private entity which provides such service or services and including all equipment and structures necessary to provide such services. 
River bank means the rising ground, bordering a river, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
River corridor means all land, including islands, not regulated under the Metropolitan River Protection Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq., or the Coastal Marshland Protection Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-280 through 12-293, in areas of a protected river and being within 100 feet horizontally on both sides of the river as measured from the river banks. 
The 100-foot buffer shall be measured horizontally from the uppermost part of the river bank, usually marked by a break in slope. Although not within the measured 100-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river water shall be treated in the same manner as the river corridor. 
Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purpose of this article, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for the local comprehensive plan. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the start of the review period will require a revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the time of the next review.

Secs. 34-162—34-175. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE VII. - WETLAND PROTECTION ORDINANCE[7] 

Footnotes: 
--- (7) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. of 12-19-00(3), §§ 1—8, 10, did not specifically amend this Code. Hence, inclusion of said ordinance provisions as art. VII, §§ 34-176—34-184 was at the editor's discretion. 

Sec. 34-176. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  Findings of fact. Wetlands are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia. 
Nationally, a considerable number of wetland resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. It is, therefore, necessary to discourage development activities that may adversely affect wetlands by ensuring maximum protection for wetlands located in the unincorporated area of Sumter County, Georgia. 
(b)  Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the Wetland Protection Ordinance of Sumter County, Georgia. The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature and wildlife habitat. 
(Ord. of 12-19-00(3), §§ 1—1.2) 
Sec. 34-177. - Wetland protection district. 
(a)  Wetland protection district. This article shall apply to all lands within wetlands located in the unincorporated area of Sumter County, Georgia, outside the cities of Americus, Andersonville, DeSoto, Leslie and Plains. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the code enforcement officer. 
(b)  Wetland protection district boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document, and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners that a subject site may be in a jurisdictional wetland or in proximity to a jurisdictional wetland, requiring the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a Section 404 permit will be required prior to initiation of any development activity on the subject site. The generalized wetland map does not represent precise boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands in the unincorporated area of Sumter County, and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
(Ord. of 12-19-00(3), §§ 2—2.2) 
Sec. 34-178. - Local development permits. 
(a)  Local development permit requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the permitting officer in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not identified in subsection (b), below shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development appears to be located within a wetland protection district boundary, or within 50 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the permitting officer from review of the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site and that a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following receipt by the local permitting officer of a copy of the Section 404 permit or letter of permission issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
(b)  Permissible uses (uses as of right). The following uses shall be allowed as of right within a wetland to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein. 
(1)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided they do not affect waters of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
(2)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
(3)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
(4)  The continued cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall; however, be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. Disturbances of wetlands for agricultural purposes are subject to the Swampbuster Act of the 1985 Farm Bill, and are to be reported to the USDA Farm Service Agency prior to commencement. 
(5)  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
(6)  Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
(c)  Temporary emergency permit. A temporary, emergency permit can be issued by the permitting officer for the following reasons: 
(1)  Maintenance or repair of lawfully located roads or structures and of facilities used in the service of the public to provide transportation, electric, gas, water, telephone, telegraph, telecommunication or other services, provided that such roads, structures or facilities are not materially changed or enlarged, and written notice prior to the commencement of work has been given to the permitting officer, and provided that the work is conducted using best management practices to ensure that flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of the wetland are not impaired, and that any adverse effect on the aquatic environment will be minimized. 
(2)  Temporary water-level stabilization measures associated with ongoing silvicultural operations. 
(3)  Limited ditching, tilling, dredging, excavating or filling done solely for the purpose of maintaining or repairing existing drainage systems necessary for the cultivation of agricultural crops, provided the maintenance or repair activity does not result in the impairment, alteration or loss of wetlands not previously subject to agricultural and silvicultural use under the terms and provisions of subsection (b)(4). 
(4)  Limited excavating and filling necessary for the repair and maintenance of piers, walkways, nature trails, observation decks, wildlife management shelters, boathouses or other similar water-related structures, provided such facilities and structures are built on pilings to allow unobstructed flow of water and preserve the natural contour of the wetland. 
(d)  Site plans. Applications for a local development permit within the generalized wetland protection district shall include a site plan, drawn to a scale of one inch equals fifty feet (1″ = 50′), unless a different scale is approved, in advance, by the permitting officer, with the following information: 
(1)  A map of all planned excavation and fill, including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved with cross-sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on the cross-sectional drawings. 
(2)  A map of any wetland boundaries occurring within the site must be provided. This boundary may be included on other maps provided by the applicant. 
(3)  Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site and adjacent to the site for a distance of 200 feet. 
(4)  The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the subject site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body. 
(5)  Elevation of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than two feet; and no greater than one foot for slopes less than or equal to two percent. 
(6)  Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing hazardous or toxic materials released accidently. 
(7)  All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology. 
(e)  Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform with the specifications of said site plan. The site plan may be amended only with approval of the permitting officer. The permitting officer may require additional information deemed necessary to verify compliance with the provisions of this article or to evaluate the proposed use in terms of the purposes of this article. 
(f)  Subdivision approval in the wetland protection district. Any application for subdivision approval shall include a jurisdictional determination approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present and that a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, subdivision approval will be issued only following issuance of the Section 404 permit or letter of permission. 
(g)  Subdivision design options in the wetland protection district. Any subdivision that includes jurisdictional wetlands shall be allowed and encouraged to use the following options: 
(1)  Lot size averaging. Lot size averaging is encouraged in single-family detached subdivisions as a means to work around wetland areas. The permitting officer may allow a reduction in lot size provided the same number of lots in the same subdivision are oversized by an equal or greater area. The maximum permissible reduction shall not exceed 25 percent of the minimum required lot area. The number of lots with areas reduced shall not exceed 25 percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision. The permitting officer shall allow no more than a 25 percent adjustment of rear, side and front setbacks for each affected lot. 
(2)  Cluster development. Clustering of residential development is encouraged in single-family detached subdivisions as a way around wetland areas. When considering subdivision approval, the permitting officer may allow incorporation of wetland or other significant natural areas as open space in the subdivision plan. Such plans should designate at least 25 percent of the gross land area as open space. Density shall be calculated by subtracting from the total acreage of a parcel all land dedicated or in use for private or public roads, including all vehicular rights-of-way. The resultant acreage will then be divided by the minimum allowed lot size of the district to derive the number of lots permissible. 
(h)  Filing fee. At the time of the application, the applicant shall pay a filing fee specified by the permitting officer. Filing fees up to the larger of $25.00, or $100.00 per acre shall be required to evaluate the application. This fee may be used to retain expert consultants who will provide services pertaining to functional assessment, mitigation and wetland boundary determinations as deemed necessary by the permitting officer. 
(i)  Enforcement authority. The permitting officer is the department, office or individual assigned the responsibility of administering this article. At the time this article is adopted, the administrative authority is vested in the office of the code enforcement officer. 
(j)  Review procedures. The application shall be made to the permitting officer and will be reviewed within 30 days. The review period shall begin upon the permitting officer's written determination that the application submitted is complete. The review period shall include the preparation of findings (approval, conditional approval or disapproval) by the permitting officer. The applicant will receive written notification of the findings of the permitting officer. If the review process is not completed and written finding not released within 30 days, the application is considered to be approved. 
(k)  Appeals. Decisions on permit applications made by the permitting officer may be appealed to the Sumter County Board of Commissioners. The appeal must be submitted in writing to the county clerk within ten days of the decision rendered by the permitting officer. A public hearing shall be held by the board of commissioners for appeals. Public announcement of the hearing shall be printed in a local newspaper of general circulation at least 15 days but not more than 45 days prior to the hearing. Any person may offer testimony at the hearing. The decision of the Sumter County Board of Commissioners shall be issued within 15 days of the public hearing and may be appealed to the Sumter County Superior Court. 
(l)  Duration of permit validity. 
(1)  If construction described in the development permit has not commenced within six months from the date of issuance, the permit shall expire. 
(2)  If construction described in the development permit is suspended or abandoned after work has commenced, the permit shall expire six months after the date work ceased. 
(3)  Written notice of the pending expiration of the development permit may be issued by the Permitting Officer, but no such notification is required. 
(Ord. of 12-19-00(3), §§ 3—3.12.3) 
Sec. 34-179. - Monitoring and enforcement. 
(a)  The permitting officer shall have authority to enter upon privately owned land for the purpose of determining whether the provisions of this article are applicable, for the purpose of performing duties required under this article, and for the purpose of taking or causing to be made such examinations, surveys or sampling as the permitting officer deems necessary. 
(1)  The permitting officer shall have authority to enter the subject site to monitor development and to enforce this article; issue permits hereunder; and address violations or threatened violations hereof by issuance of violation notices, administrative orders and civil and criminal actions. All costs, fees and expenses in connection with such actions may be recovered as damages against the violator. 
(2)  Law enforcement officials or other officials having police powers in the jurisdiction shall have authority to assist the permitting officer with enforcement. 
(3)  The permitting officer shall have authority to issue cease and desist orders in the event of any violation of this article. Cease and desist orders may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction, as identified herein. 
(b)  The permitting officer may require a bond with surety and conditions sufficient to secure compliance with the conditions set forth in the permit. The particular amount and the conditions of the bond shall be consistent with the purposes of this article. In the event of a breach of any condition of any such bond, the permitting officer may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction upon such bond and prosecute the same to judgment and execution. 
(c)  When the permitting officer determines a building or other structure has been constructed in violation of this article, the violator may, at the discretion of the permitting officer, be required to remove the structure. 
(d)  When removal of vegetative cover, excavation or fill has taken place in violation of this article, the violator may, at the discretion of the permitting officer and as far as practicable, be required to restore the affected land to its original contours and to restore vegetation. 
(e)  If the permitting officer discovers a violation of this article that also constitutes a violation of any provision of the Clean Water Act as amended, the permitting officer shall issue written notification of the violation to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the landowner. 
(f)  Suspension, revocation.

(Ord. of 10-20-09) 
Sec. 38-32. - Authorization. 
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Sumter County Board of Commissioners, of Sumter County, Georgia, does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. of 10-20-09) 
Sec. 38-33. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of Sumter County, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. of 10-20-09) 
Sec. 38-34. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(Ord. of 10-20-09) 
Sec. 38-35. - Objectives. 
The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
(7)  To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. of 10-20-09) 
Sec. 38-36. - Lands to which this article applies. 
This article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Sumter County, Georgia. 
(Ord. of 10-20-09) 
Sec. 38-37. - Basis for area of special flood hazard. 
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its flood insurance study (FIS), dated September 11, 2009, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this article. 
For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS dated September 11, 2009, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, for Sumter County are hereby adopted by reference. 
Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS. These include the 1995 base flood elevation data prepared by the United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) and provided to the county by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
The repository for public inspection of the flood insurance study (FIS), accompanying maps and other supporting data is located at the office of code enforcement. 
(Ord. of 10-20-09)

(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(Ord. of 10-20-09) 
Sec. 38-42. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of Sumter County or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. of 10-20-09) 
Sec. 38-43. - Penalties for violation. 
Failure to comply with the provisions of this article or with any of its requirements, including conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a violation.

Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.

New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after April 11, 1995. 
North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA Flood Modernization Maps. 
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any article requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(3)  Jacks for forcing the conduit pipe through the roadbed shall have a jacking head constructed in a manner that applies uniform pressure around the ring of the pipe during the jacking operation. When jacking a conduit pipe, the conduit pipe shall be set on guides and braced together so as to properly support and direct the section of the pipe to the proper line and grade. 
(4)  The diameter of the excavation shall conform to the outside diameter and circumference of the conduit pipe as closely as possible. Any voids that develop during the jacking operation that are determined by the Public Works Department to be detrimental to the work shall be pressure grouted with a mixture approved by the public works Department.

(6)  Installing any antenna or tower not to exceed the limitations contained in subsection 70-40(f) and provided accessory structures are located underground where technically feasible or shielded to the satisfaction of the planning director or his/her designee. 
If the planning director or his/her designee determine that any application for an administratively approved use does not meet the general application requirements, development requirements and/or standards enumerated herein, administrative approval of the application shall be denied provided substantial evidence exists to support such denial. Such evidence shall be summarized for the applicant along with a recommendation as to whether the applicant should pursue a variance or proceed to a public hearing as specified in subsection (b) below. Applicants may appeal the administrative denial to the county board of commissioners pursuant to the procedures described in Section _______ of Appendix A ("Zoning") of Sumter County Ordinances. Any other party aggrieved by the decision of the planning director or his/her designee may file an appeal to the board of commissioners including payment of the filing fee. For purposes of this section an aggrieved party is one who demonstrates that his or her property will suffer special damage as a result of the decision complained of rather than merely some damage that is common to all property owners and citizens similarly situated. 
The board of commissioners shall dispense with the appeal by either: 
(7)  A determination that the application is valid and meets all applicable criteria for an administratively approved use under this article, which shall result in the issuance of a permit. 
(8)  A determination that the application does not satisfy all applicable criteria for an approved administratively use under this article, but, owing to special conditions, a variance as to separation or setback requirements: 
a.  Will not be contrary to the public interest; 
b.  Will relieve unnecessary hardship; and 
c.  Shall preserve the intent and spirit of this article. 
(9)  A determination that the application does not satisfy all applicable criteria for an administratively approved use under this article and the deficiencies cannot, subject to the conditions listed above, properly be cured by a variance.

ARTICLE III. - ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONING DISTRICTS 

Sec. 3.01. - Districts. 
The unincorporated area of Sumter County is hereby divided into zoning districts as follows: 

 
Sec. 3.02. - District boundaries. 
A.  The boundaries of the above districts are shown on a set of maps designated "Official Zoning Map, Sumter County, Georgia." 
B.  Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any district as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
1.  Where zoning district boundaries are indicated as following the center lines of roads or highways or railroad rights-of-way, or extensions to said center lines or rights-of-way, such center lines or rights-of-way or extensions of such lines shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
2.  Where district boundaries are indicated as following the county line, the corporate limits line of any incorporated place, the militia district line of any militia district, or the land lot line of any land lot, such county line, corporate limits line, militia district line or land lot line shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
3.  Where district boundaries are indicated as parallel to the center lines of streets or highways, such district boundaries, unless otherwise specifically indicated, shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at a distance of 200 or 500 feet from the right-of-way line of such streets and highways with each such boundary being shown at scale on the official zoning map. 
4.  Where district boundaries are indicated as following the center line of stream beds or river beds, or extensions thereof, such center lines or such lines extended shall be construed to be such boundaries. 
Sec. 3.03. - District boundary lines dividing a lot. 
In the event a district boundary line on the zoning map divides a lot of record held in one ownership on the date of passage of this chapter [appendix], each part of the lot so divided shall be used in conformity with the regulations established by this chapter [appendix] for the district in which each such part is located; except, however, that if the property owner of such a lot so desires, he may extend a use allowed on said lot 50 feet beyond the district boundary line but shall comply with setbacks and yard requirements of the district into which he is encroaching. 
Sec. 3.04. - Limited use (L.U.) provision. 
The board of commissioners establishes the limited use provision for the purpose of allowing an applicant to request that a certain area be designated as a limited use. In some areas of the county a particular land use activity out of a general zoning classification may have less community impact than some of the possibilities of uses in that specific classification. For this reason, an applicant may request in his rezoning petition to limit the use of a proposed property to a specified use only, e.g. C-1 L.U./beauty shop. The limited use must be among the uses permitted in the zoning classification for which the limited use is taken. 
ARTICLE IV. - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 4.01. - Conflicting regulations. 
Whenever any provision of this chapter [appendix] imposes more stringent requirements, regulations, restrictions or limitations than are imposed or required by any other county ordinance, this chapter [appendix] shall govern. 
Sec. 4.02. - Scope. 
No building or structure, as defined herein, or part thereof, shall hereinafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, or altered and maintained, and no new use or change shall be made or maintained of any building, structure or land, or part thereof, except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter [appendix]. Land, structures and buildings presently used for agricultural purposes are exempted from residential, commercial and industrial zoning restrictions; however, any present agricultural use and/or improvement must satisfy agriculture district regulations regardless of the district within which they are developed. 
Sec. 4.03. - Only one principal building per lot. 
Except as herein provided, there shall be no more than one principal building per lot or parcel other than within a (residential or commercial) planned unit development (PUD). For the purpose of supporting farming operations there shall be permitted in the AG district one accessory residential use per each ten acres on a farm under single ownership where the following conditions can be met: 
A.  Each such non-principal/accessory residence shall have a land area of not less than one acre reserved for the specific use of said residence.

Any lot of record on April 19, 1999, that does not meet the requirements of this chapter [appendix] for yards or other area or open space, may be utilized for a use for which it is herein zoned, provided the area of such yard or court in width, depth, or open space is not less than 75 percent of that required by the terms of this chapter [appendix]. However, substandard lots in the rural residential and agriculture districts are exempted from the 75 percent requirement. The purpose is to permit utilization of recorded lots which lack adequate width or depth as long as reasonable living or working standards can be provided. Adjacent substandard lots under the same ownership shall be combined, where possible, to make standard lots. 
Sec. 4.06. - Substandard lots resulting from public dedication or condemnation. 
In the event an undeveloped lot of record is reduced in size through an act of public dedication or condemnation for public purposes, the development standards contained in the chapter for width, depth, or area may be waived by the planning commission and such property may be utilized for all permitted and, where authorized, conditional uses. Said waiver is permissible only if the county health department determines that the health and general welfare of the lot owner and the county will not be adversely affected by the intended use. Adjacent, undeveloped lots of record which are owned by the same individual and which are affected by dedication or condemnation for public purposes shall be combined, where possible, to standard lots. 
Sec. 4.07. - Lot frontage. 
Every lot shall front a public road. No building shall be erected on a parcel that does not abut a public street, or road, except as otherwise provided herein.

Sec. 4.13. - Animals in residential districts. 
A.  It is the intent of this section to permit certain uses in R-1, R-2 and RR districts which involve the keeping of limited numbers of domestic animals or pets where it is recognized that such areas are changing from agricultural to suburban residential in character. This section is further intended to minimize problems which may arise from such animal uses and to provide suitable standards for protection of health, safety, welfare and preservation of residential districts from indiscriminate raising of animals. 
B.  Uses permitted: 
1.  Permitted use provisions for animals in residential districts are meant to apply only outside of the residence on an individual lot and are not intended to restrict the type or number of animals within a residence. 
2.  The keeping of livestock, fowl or domestic pets shall not be allowed to become a nuisance. 
3.  Domestic pets such as cats, dogs, rabbits or other generally recognized domestic pets may be kept or bred by persons residing on the property for their use and enjoyment. The keeping of swine is specifically prohibited.

D.  Uses prohibited: The keeping, breeding or training of any animals or fowl for monetary gain or profit shall be deemed a commercial business and is expressly prohibited in all residential districts except where such operations may qualify as a home occupation or as a nonconforming use as defined in this chapter [appendix]. The keeping of swine is specifically prohibited. 
Sec. 4.14. - Conditional uses. 
A.  Before a building permit shall be issued for a conditional use, application shall be made to the planning commission, which, after careful review of any applicable sections of this chapter [appendix], may recommend to the board of commissioners the issuance of such permit if, in the judgment of the planning commission, it will not be detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the county. 
B.  An application to establish a conditional use shall be approved following a review by the planning commission and a determination by the board of commissioners that: 
1.  The proposed use shall not be contrary to the purpose of this chapter [appendix]. 
2.  The proposed use shall not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties or the general neighborhood, nor affect adversely the health and safety of residents and workers. 
3.  The proposed use shall not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend or use such facility, vehicular movement, noise or fume generation or type of physical activity. 
4.  The proposed use shall not be affected adversely by the existing uses, and the proposed use will be placed on a lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of said use. 
5.  Parking and all development standards set forth for each particular use for which a permit may be granted have been met. 
C.  The board of commissioners may impose or require additional restrictions and standards as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents in the community, and to protect the value and use of property in the general neighborhood.

Sec. 4.15. - Variances. 
A.  The planning commission shall authorize, in specific cases, variances from the terms of this chapter [appendix] to the extent said variances will not, in the opinion of the planning commission, be contrary to the public interest, and where owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of this chapter [appendix] will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship. Variance may be granted in individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon a finding that: 
1.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography; 
2.  The application of this chapter [appendix] to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; 
3.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and 
4.  Release, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public interest or impair the purposes and intent of this chapter [appendix]. 
B.  No variance may be granted for use of land or building that is prohibited by this chapter [appendix]. The county will control the actual use of properties through zoning and conditional uses and not through variance. 
C.  In exercising the powers granted in subsection A. of this section, the planning commission shall not consider any nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the same district, nor any permitted use of lands, structures or buildings in other districts as grounds for the issuance of a variance. 
D.  If the planning commission grants a variance, the reason for such variance must be put forth clearly in the minutes of the meeting at which the variance was granted. 
E.  A public hearing is required for all variances. 
Sec. 4.16. - Special exceptions.

The planning commission shall fix a reasonable time for a public hearing on the request for a special exception and shall give at least 15 days public notice of the time and place of said hearing, to be published in the newspaper of general circulation in the county. 
D.  The planning commission at said public hearing shall consider any testimony in favor of or opposed to said request for a special exception and shall either grant or deny said request for a special exception at the conclusion of said public hearing using the following standards: 
1.  The proposed use or structure shall be compatible with development and uses existing on adjacent and nearby property. 
2.  The proposed use or structure shall not have a substantial adverse impact upon the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property. 
3.  The proposed use or structure shall not cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, schools or other public facilities. 
4.  Any other relevant factors, including the conformity of the proposed development with duly adopted land use and other physical development plans or policies for the area, may also be considered. 
E.  Special exceptions granted by the planning commission shall be valid for a period of 12 months from date of approval, shall not be transferable except upon written approval of the board of commissioners, and shall be executed within the grant period or become null and void and subject to procedures for resubmission as established in this section. 
F.  Said special exception, if granted by the planning commission, shall be granted only for the special exception requested in the application and for no other purposes. 
Sec. 4.17. - Site plan review. 
A.  In order to assure that the requirements of this chapter [appendix] are satisfied, all applications for a building permit shall be accompanied by a building site plan which shall conform to the following list of requirements, and be reviewed by the zoning administrator to determine compliance with this chapter [appendix] before a building permit is issued: 
1.  Site location map. 
2.  The site plan shall be drawn to a minimum scale of one inch equals 100 feet.

ARTICLE VII. - R-3 MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT 

Sec. 7.01. - Statement of purpose. 
A.  The R-3 district is designed to permit residential use of land with various types of multiple dwellings and related uses. This district should be located near major arterial and collector roads for good accessibility, and near utility infrastructure to reduce costs of development. Developments in this district are intended to complement single-family developments. Various types and sizes of residential accommodations, for ownership or rental, would thereby be provided to meet the needs of the different age and family groups in the community without overtaxing existing community facilities, utilities or services. 
B.  It is also the intention of this article to provide areas of sufficient size and allowing reasonable flexibility in design and orientation for the establishment of a structure or group of structures which include multiple dwellings designed in a planned unit development of more than one building on a given site. The requirements of area, height, bulk, and placement regulations, as they are usually applicable to individual buildings and individual lots of record, would in certain cases of large scale development have results affording less protection to the public health, safety and welfare than if a measure of flexibility were permitted. The permitting of planned unit developments as special and particular land uses can, in certain cases, increase the desirability and convenience to the residents or occupants of the planned unit development without causing adverse effects on adjoining properties. This type of development will permit a creative approach to residential development. A planned unit development will provide for an efficient use of land potentially resulting in more economical networks of streets and utilities thereby lowering housing and other land development costs as well as enhancing the appearance of neighborhoods through the preservation of natural features and the provision of recreation areas and open space.

ARTICLE VIII. - RR RURAL RESIDENTIAL 

Sec. 8.01. - Statement of purpose. 
The RR district is composed of certain areas having both rural and single-family residential characteristics, and areas where it is desirable and likely that similar development will occur in the future. The district is characterized by very low density of housing and large lot sizes, as well as permitting uses that are associated with rural areas. It is designed to accommodate residential development opportunities for those who desire exurban, low-density, or estate living, and are willing to live in more remote locations and to assume the costs of providing many of their own services and amenities. The public provision of these amenities is limited because the county must concentrate its limited resources in areas where more intense future development is logical. The sparse development allowed in this district is necessitated by the county's need to preserve and support existing public infrastructure. 
Sec. 8.02. - Permitted uses. 
The following uses are permitted in the RR district: 
A.  Accessory building or use customarily incidental to any permitted use, when located on the same lot and not involving any business, profession, trade or occupation, provided that all accessory buildings shall conform and be located as required in section 4.10. 
B.  Agricultural activities limited to row-crop and nut production, open grazing of livestock, horticulture and silviculture. 
C.  Aquaculture. 
D.  Church, provided the proposed site is not less than three acres, and a complete site development plan is submitted with the application for a building permit. 
E.  Home occupation. 
F.  Garden. 
G.  Guest home and servant quarters. 
H.  Keeping livestock and fowl on residential property for noncommercial purposes provided the following requirements are met: 
1.  Horses, cows, ponies, donkeys and other domestic livestock may be kept, raised or bred for home use and enjoyment; provided that only three such animals shall be permitted for each 50,000 square feet of land area, not to include the front yard of the principal dwelling, and all livestock shall be adequately fenced within the property. 
2.  Ducks, quail, chickens, turkeys, pigeons, pheasants, etc., may be raised for home use and enjoyment provided that such fowl are adequately contained within the property. 
3.  The keeping, breeding or training of any animals for monetary gain or profit shall be deemed a commercial business and is expressly prohibited except where such operation may qualify as a home occupation or as a nonconforming use. 
4.  No animal or fowl of any kind shall be kept on a lot in this district when there is no principal dwelling on the lot. 
I.  Single-family, detached dwelling, including manufactured home. 
Sec. 8.03. - Conditional uses. 
The following are conditional uses in the RR district: 
A.  Bed and breakfast inn. 
B.  Nursery school, kindergarten or day care facility provided all state licensing requirements are met. 
C.  Privately owned outdoor recreational facility such as skeet ranges, golf and county club, hunting preserve, swimming or tennis club and other similar use. 
D.  Public cemetery provided a complete site development sketch is submitted with the application (five-acre minimum site size with an adequate buffer).

(Ord. of 4-19-16(1), § 1) 
Sec. 11.04. - Conflicts. 
By their very nature, some agricultural activities generate noises, odors and insect pests which are detrimental to nearby land uses/occupants. To the extent they are a function of the size of the specific agricultural activity, the adverse or negative efforts of some of these noises, odors and insects can be mitigated somewhat by distance. For the purpose of mitigating said adverse and negative impacts, minimum distances between agricultural activities and surrounding land uses are hereby established (sections 11.05 and 11.06) on the basis of low and high density agricultural operations. 
Sec. 11.05. - Low density farm animal operations and row crop operations. 
A.  Farm animal operations of sizes smaller or equal to the following thresholds are classified as low density: 

 
B.  All low density farm animal operations constructed or expanded adjacent to an existing, noncompatible land use (e.g., residential) shall construct all buildings and fencing used for animal confinement (e.g., poultry house, farrowing house) at least 150 feet from the centerline of an adjoining public road, and 200 feet from the property line of the adjoining, noncompatible land use. Confinement fencing is not to be confused with boundary fencing, the latter of which may be constructed along the right-of-way and property line. The area between confinement fencing and boundary fencing may be used for row crop, vegetable or orchard production, or pasture. In the event said area is used for pasture it shall not be stocked at a rate higher than recommended by generally accepted animal husbandry practices for open grazing of the specific animal species. Where said area is grazed, fencing, as necessary, shall be erected around any surface feature, e.g., bog, to prevent livestock from congregating along boundary fencing adjacent to the property line of a noncompatible land use. Livestock catch pens shall be allowed in the grazing area, provided the specific site does not retain water. 
C.  The site(s) used for temporary storage or treatment of any waste or by-product of a low density farm animal operation shall be located at least 150 feet from the center line of an adjoining public road, and at least 200 feet from the property line of the adjoining, noncompatible land use. 
D.  Machinery and equipment used to ventilate animal confinement buildings must be installed in such a way that air removed from said buildings is directed away from nearby development(s). 
E.  Any development proposed for a site adjacent to and not compatible with an existing low density farm animal operation or row-crop operation shall be constructed at least 150 feet from the centerline of the adjoining public road when said development fronts the low density from animal operation or row-crop operation, and 200 feet from the adjoining property line, when said development is adjacent to the low density farm animal operation or row-crop operation. 
Sec. 11.06. - High density farm animal operations. 
A.  Farm animal operations of sizes greater than the thresholds identified in section 11.05 (low density farm animal operations) are classified as high density farm animal operations. 
B.  High density farm animal operations initiated, constructed or expanded adjacent to an existing, noncompatible land use (e.g., residential) shall construct farm buildings and fencing used for animal confinement (e.g., poultry house, farrowing house, feedlot) at least 1,500 feet from the center line of an adjoining public road, and 1,500 feet from the property line of the adjoining, noncompatible land use. Confinement fencing is not to be confused with boundary fencing, the latter of which may be constructed along the right-of-way and property line. The area between confinement fencing and boundary fencing may be used for row crop, vegetable or orchard production, or pasture. In the event said area is used for pasture it shall not be stocked at a rate higher than recommended by generally accepted animal husbandry practices for open grazing of the specific animal species. Where said area is grazed, fencing, as necessary, shall be erected around any surface feature, e.g., bog, to prevent livestock from congregating along boundary fencing adjacent to the property line of a noncompatible land use. Livestock catch pens shall be allowed in this grazing area provided the specific site does not retain water.

Said map is hereby declared part of and incorporated by reference into this code. The FIRM shall be maintained by the zoning administrator as part of the official zoning map of Sumter County readily available for public review and reference.
