PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Dallas, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the prior compilation of ordinances, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the Dallas City Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Michael E. Raabe, Code Attorney, and Deborah J. Heath, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Boyd L. Austin, Jr., Mayor, and Kendall Smith, City Manager, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(7)  Tie bids. If two or more bids received are for the same amount or unit price with quality, service, and delivery being equal, and if the public interest will not permit the delay for re-advertising for bids, the city council may accept the one it chooses, or accept the lowest bona fide offer by negotiation with the tie bidders at the time of the bid opening. 
(8)  Performance bonds. The purchasing agent shall have authority to require a performance bond before entering into a contract, in such amount as it shall be found reasonably necessary to protect the best interests of the city. If the purchasing agent requires a performance bond, the form and amount of the bond shall be described in the notice inviting bids.

( Ord. No. OA-2016-01, 3-7-2016 ) 
Sec. 2-235. - City of Dallas policy for competitive negotiation qualifications-based selection for projects using federal aid highway program (FAHP) funding. 
(1)  Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3) below, the city shall use the competitive negotiation method for the procurement of engineering and design related services when FAHP funds are involved in the contract (as specified in 23 USC 112(b)(2)(A)). The solicitation, evaluation, ranking, selection, and negotiation shall comply with the qualifications-based selection procurement procedures for architectural and engineering services codified under 40 USC 1101-1104, commonly referred to as the Brooks Act. 
In accordance with the requirements of the Brooks Act, the following procedures shall apply to the competitive negotiation procurement method: 
1.  Solicitation. The solicitation process shall be by public announcement, public advertisement, or any other public forum or method that assures qualified in-state and out-of-state consultants are given a fair opportunity to be considered for award of the contract. Procurement procedures may involve a single step process with issuance of a request for proposal (RFP) to all interested consultants or a multiphase process with issuance of a request for statements or letters of interest or qualifications (RFQ) whereby responding consultants are ranked based on qualifications and request for proposals are then provided to three or more of the most highly qualified consultants. Minimum qualifications of consultants to perform services under general work categories or areas of expertise may also be assessed through a prequalification process whereby statements of qualifications are submitted on an annual basis. Regardless of any process utilized for prequalification of consultants or for an initial assessment of a consultant's qualifications under an RFQ, a RFP specific to the project, task, or service is required for evaluation of a consultant's specific technical approach and qualifications. 
2.  Request for proposal (RFP). The RFP shall provide all information and requirements necessary for interested consultants to provide a response to the RFP and compete for the solicited services. The RFP shall: 
(a)  Provide a clear, accurate, and detailed description of the scope of work, technical requirements, and qualifications of consultants necessary for the services to be rendered. The scope of work should detail the purpose and description of the project, services to be performed, deliverables to be provided, estimated schedule for performance of the work, and applicable standards, specifications, and policies; 
(b)  Identify the requirements for any discussions that may be conducted with three or more of the most highly qualified consultants following submission and evaluation of proposals; 
(c)  Identify evaluation factors including their relative weight of importance in accordance with subparagraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section; 
(d)  Specify the contract type and method(s) of payment to be utilized in accordance with § 172.9; 
(e)  Identify any special provisions or contract requirements associated with the solicited services; 
(f)  Require that submission of any requested cost proposals or elements of cost be in a concealed format and separate from technical/qualifications proposals as these shall not be considered in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase; and 
(g)  Provide a schedule of key dates for the procurement process and establish a submittal deadline for responses to the RFP which provides sufficient time for interested consultants to receive notice, prepare, and submit a proposal, which except in unusual circumstances shall be not less than 14 days from the date of issuance of the RFP. 
3.  Evaluation factors. 
(a)  Criteria used for evaluation, ranking, and selection of consultants to perform engineering and design related services must assess the demonstrated competence and qualifications for the type of professional services solicited. These qualifications-based factors may include, but are not limited to, technical approach (e.g., project understanding, innovative concepts or alternatives, quality control procedures), work experience, specialized expertise, professional licensure, staff capabilities, workload capacity, and past performance. 
(b)  Price shall not be used as a factor in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase. All price or cost related items which include, but are not limited to, cost proposals, direct salaries/wage rates, indirect cost rates, and other direct costs are prohibited from being used as evaluation criteria. 
(c)  In-state or local preference shall not be used as a factor in the evaluation, ranking, and selection phase. State licensing laws are not preempted by this provision and professional licensure within a jurisdiction may be established as a requirement which attests to the minimum qualifications and competence of a consultant to perform the solicited services. 
(d)  The following non-qualifications based evaluation criteria are permitted under the specified conditions and provided the combined total of these criteria do not exceed a nominal value of ten percent of the total evaluation criteria to maintain the integrity of a qualifications-based selection: 
i.  A local presence may be used as a nominal evaluation factor where appropriate. This criterion shall not be based on political or jurisdictional boundaries and may be applied on a project-by-project basis for contracts where a need has been established for a consultant to provide a local presence, a local presence will add value to the quality and efficiency of the project, and application of this criteria leaves an appropriate number of qualified consultants, given the nature and size of the project. If a consultant outside of the locality area indicates as part of a proposal that it will satisfy the criteria in some manner, such as establishing a local project office, that commitment shall be considered to have satisfied the local presence criteria. 
ii.  The participation of qualified and certified disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE) sub-consultants may be used as a nominal evaluation criterion where appropriate in accordance with 49 CFR part 26 and the city's FHWA-approved DBE program. 
4.  Evaluation, ranking, and selection. 
(a)  Consultant proposals shall be evaluated by the city based on the criteria established and published within the public solicitation. 
(b)  While the contract will be with the prime consultant, proposal evaluations shall consider the qualifications of the prime consultant and any sub-consultants identified within the proposal with respect to the scope of work and established criteria. 
(c)  Following submission and evaluation of proposals, the city shall conduct interviews or other types of discussions determining three of the most highly qualified consultants to clarify the technical approach, qualifications, and capabilities provided in response to the RFP. Discussion requirements shall be specified within the RFP and should be based on the size and complexity of the project as defined in city written policies and procedures (as specified in § 172.5(c)). Discussions may be written, by telephone, video conference, or by oral presentation/interview. Discussions following proposal submission are not required provided proposals contain sufficient information for evaluation of technical approach and qualifications to perform the specific project, task, or service with respect to established criteria. 
(d)  From the proposal evaluation and any subsequent discussions which have been conducted, the city shall rank, in order of preference, at least three consultants determined most highly qualified to perform the solicited services based on the established and published criteria. 
(e)  Notification must be provided to responding consultants of the final ranking of the three most highly qualified consultants. 
(f)  The city shall retain acceptable documentation of the solicitation, proposal, evaluation, and selection of the consultant in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR 18.42. 
5.  Negotiation. 
(a)  Independent estimate. Prior to receipt or review of the most highly qualified consultant's cost proposal, the city shall prepare a detailed independent estimate with an appropriate breakdown of the work or labor hours, types or classifications of labor required, other direct costs, and consultant's fixed fee for the defined scope of work. The independent estimate shall serve as the basis for negotiation and ensuring the consultant services are obtained at a fair and reasonable cost. 
(b)  Elements of contract costs (e.g., indirect cost rates, direct salary or wage rates, fixed fees, and other direct costs) shall be established separately in accordance with § 172.11. 
(c)  If concealed cost proposals were submitted in conjunction with technical/qualifications proposals, only the cost proposal of the consultant with which negotiations are initiated may be considered. Concealed cost proposals of consultants with which negotiations are not initiated should be returned to the respective consultant due to the confidential nature of this data (as specified in 23 USC 112(b)(2)(E)). 
(d)  The city shall retain documentation of negotiation activities and resources used in the analysis of costs to establish elements of the contract in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR 18.42. This documentation shall include the consultant cost certification and documentation supporting the acceptance of the indirect cost rate to be applied to the contract (as specified in § 172.11(c)). 
(2)  Small purchases. The small purchase method involves procurement of engineering and design related services where an adequate number of qualified sources are reviewed and the total contract costs do not exceed an established simplified acquisition threshold. The city may use the state's small purchase procedures which reflect applicable state laws and regulations for the procurement of engineering and design related services provided the total contract costs do not exceed the federal simplified acquisition threshold (as specified in 48 CFR 2.101). When a lower threshold for use of small purchase procedures is established in state law, regulation, or policy, the lower threshold shall apply to the use of FAHP funds. The following additional requirements shall apply to the small purchase procurement method: 
1.  The scope of work, project phases, and contract requirements shall not be broken down into smaller components merely to permit the use of small purchase procedures. 
2.  A minimum of three consultants are required to satisfy the adequate number of qualified sources reviewed. 
3.  Contract costs may be negotiated in accordance with state small purchase procedures; however, the allowability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the federal cost principles. 
4.  The full amount of any contract modification or amendment that would cause the total contract amount to exceed the established simplified acquisition threshold would be ineligible for federal aid funding. The FHWA may withdraw all federal aid from a contract if it is modified or amended above the applicable established simplified acquisition threshold. 
(3)  Noncompetitive. The noncompetitive method involves procurement of engineering and design related services when it is not feasible to award the contract using competitive negotiation or small purchase procurement methods. The following requirements shall apply to the noncompetitive procurement method: 
1.  The city may use their own noncompetitive procedures which reflect applicable state and local laws and regulations and conform to applicable federal requirements. 
2.  The city shall establish a process to determine when noncompetitive procedures will be used and shall submit justification to, and receive approval from, the FHWA before using this form of contracting. 
3.  Circumstances under which a contract may be awarded by noncompetitive procedures are limited to the following: 
a.  The service is available only from a single source; 
b.  There is an emergency which will not permit the time necessary to conduct competitive negotiations; or 
c.  After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined to be inadequate. 
4.  Contract costs may be negotiated in accordance with the city noncompetitive procedures; however, the allow ability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the federal cost principles. 
(4)  Additional procurement requirements. 
1.  Common grant rule. 
i.  The city must comply with procurement requirements established in state and local laws, regulations, policies, and procedures which are not addressed by or in conflict with applicable federal laws and regulations (as specified in 49 CFR 18.36). 
ii.  When state and local procurement laws, regulations, policies, or procedures are in conflict with applicable federal laws and regulations, the city must comply with federal requirements to be eligible for federal aid reimbursement of the associated costs of the services incurred following FHWA authorization (as specified in 49 CFR 18.4). 
2.  Disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE) program. 
i.  The city shall give consideration to DBE consultants in the procurement of engineering and design related service contracts subject to 23 USC 112(b)(2) in accordance with 49 CFR part 26. When DBE program participation goals cannot be met through race-neutral measures, additional DBE participation on engineering and design related services contracts may be achieved in accordance with the city's FHWA approved DBE program through either: 
a.  Use of an evaluation criterion in the qualifications-based selection of consultants (as specified in § 172.7(a)(1)(iii)(D)); or 
b.  Establishment of a contract participation goal.

(3)  Minor repairs. Ordinary minor repairs may be made with the approval of the building official without a permit, provided that such repairs shall not violate any of the provisions of the construction codes or other city ordinances. 
(4)  Information required. Each application for a permit, with the required fee, shall be filed with the building official on a form furnished for that purpose, and shall contain a general description of the proposed work and its location. The application is signed by the contractor or owner responsible for performing the work or their authorized agent. The building permit application shall indicate the proposed occupancy of all parts of the building and of that portion of the site or lot, if any, not covered by the building or structure, and shall contain such other information as may be required by the building official. 
(5)  Time limitations. An application for a permit for any proposed work is deemed to have been abandoned six months after the date of filing for the permit, unless before then a permit has been issued.

Such refusal shall, when requested, be in writing and shall contain the reason for refusal. 
(3)  Special foundation permit. When application for a permit to erect or enlarge a building or structure has been filed and pending issuance of such permit, the building official may, at his discretion, issue a special permit for the foundation only. The holder of such a special permit is proceeding at his own risk and without assurance that a permit for the remainder of the work will be granted nor that corrections will not be required in order to meet provisions of the construction codes. 
(4)  Public right-of-way. A permit shall not be given by the building official for the construction of any building or structure, or for the alteration of any building or structure where said building or structure is to be changed and such change will affect the exterior walls, bays, balconies, or other appendages or projections fronting on any street, alley, or public lane, or for the placing on any lot or premises of any building or structure removed from another lot or premises, unless the applicant has confirmed the location of the public right-of-way lines, and it is the duty of the building official to see that the street lines are not encroached upon except as provided for by code or ordinance. 
(e)  Contractor responsibilities. It is the duty of every contractor who shall make contracts for the installation or repairs of buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical, sprinkler, or plumbing systems, for which a permit is required, to comply with state or local rules and regulations concerning licensing which the applicable governing authority may have adopted. In such case that the state requires a contractor to have obtained a state license before he is permitted to perform work, the contractor shall supply the local government with its license number before receiving a permit for work to be performed. 
(f)  Conditions of the permit. 
(1)  Permit intent. A permit issued is construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the construction codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of the construction codes. All permits expire six months after the last required inspection that has been passed, or six months after the date of issue if no required inspections have been approved. The building official may issue a six-month extension of any permit, for due cause, if requested in writing by the permit holder prior to such a permit expiring. The extension of any permit may require the payment of a fee. 
(2)  Permit issued on basis of an affidavit. Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the building official, are hazardous or complex, the building official shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations shall supervise such work. In addition, they are responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and upon completion make and file with the building official a written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the construction codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his place, a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed and approved by the building official. 
(3)  Plans. When the building official issues a permit, he shall enforce, in writing or by stamp, both sets of plans "reviewed for code compliance" or "approved" or similar. One set of drawings so reviewed is retained by the building official and the other set is returned to the applicant. The permitted drawings are to be kept at the site of work and open to inspection by the building official or his authorized representative during all times workers are present.

On all buildings, structures, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, and gas systems or alterations requiring a permit, a fee for each permit is paid as required at the time of filing application or once the permit is ready for issuance, in accordance with the fee schedules as set by the building department. 
(5)  Building permit valuations. If, in the opinion of the building official, the valuation of building, alteration, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing systems, etc. appears to be underestimated on the application, the permit shall be denied, unless the applicant can show detailed estimates to meet the approval of the building official. Permit valuations shall include the total cost of the building, electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing, equipment, and other systems, as required to erect and complete the building, dwelling or structure; including design fees, connection to utilities, site work necessary for foundation installation, materials, labor, overhead and profit. If any of the costs involved are discounted due to the use of used materials, or when labor and/or materials have been traded for some other goods or services (in whole or in part), the normal, undiscounted costs shall be used for the purpose of determining the cost (valuation) of construction in order to determine the permit fees. 
(h)  Inspections. 
(1)  Existing buildings. Before issuing a permit, the building official may examine or cause to be examined any building, electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing systems, etc. for which an application has been received for a permit to enlarge, alter, repair, move, demolish, install, or change the occupancy.

DIVISION 1. - GENERAL REGULATION OF ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS 

Sec. 10-245. - Findings; public purpose. 
Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas and Garden Grove, California, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the City of Dallas, Georgia; and based on the documentary evidence and oral testimony presented by a law enforcement professional and an expert in economic development, both of whom are familiar with conditions resulting in other localities, at the mayor and city council of Dallas, Georgia's hearing on May 3, 2012; and based on the evidence and testimony of persons who have appeared before the mayor and city council of Dallas, Georgia on other occasions including the public hearing and meeting of the mayor and city council of Dallas, Georgia conducted on May 7, 2012 and on documentary evidence and the study submitted to the Mayor and City Council of Dallas, Georgia by Scott Halter, Chief of Police of the City of Dallas, Georgia takes note of the well-known and self evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country. 
It is the finding of the mayor and city council of Dallas, Georgia that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or video graphic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community. 
Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or video graphic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or video graphic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described. The mayor and city council of Dallas, Georgia finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the city, as well. 
Furthermore, it is the finding of the mayor and city council of Dallas, Georgia that other forms of adult entertainment, including, but not limited to, adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities. 
The mayor and city council of Dallas, Georgia finds that the negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments upon the City of Dallas, Georgia are similar whether the adult entertainment establishment features live nude dancing or sells video tapes depicting sexual activities. In addition, the City of Dallas has investigated Gwinnett County, Georgia's experience with the adult bookstore located within Gwinnett County, Georgia which revealed that a substantial amount of activity at a bookstore located within that county involved booths which an individual could enter, view videos depicting sexual activity, and sexually interact with a bookstore patron in an adjoining booth through a hole strategically placed in the wall of adjoining booths. 
The mayor and the city council of Dallas, Georgia, therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and children's day care facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the mayor and city council of Dallas, Georgia finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment. The mayor and city council of Dallas, Georgia finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further finds that such will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.

Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority, the city or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority, the city or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(c)  Rules and regulations governing land disturbing activities. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this article for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require the minimum protections, at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
(15)  Except as provided in this subsection and subsection (16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq.) shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; 
c.  Nothing contained in this article shall prevent any local issuing authority or the city from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section; and 
d.  The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-20 et seq.) except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer.

(Ord. No. 06-21, § 2, 10-2-2006) 
Sec. 16-173. - Applicability. 
(a)  Generally. This article shall apply to all land development activity on property containing a stream protection area as defined in section 16-171. The following requirements are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer requirements established under state law, and approval or exemption from these requirements do not constitute approval or exemption from buffer requirements established under state law or from other applicable local, state or federal regulations: 
(1)  Grandfather provisions. This article shall not apply to the following activities: 
a.  Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land that is zoned and approved for such use on or before the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
b.  Existing development and ongoing land disturbance activities including, but not limited to, existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance, except that new development or land disturbance activities on such properties will be subject to all applicable buffer requirements. 
c.  Any land development activity that is under construction, fully approved for development, scheduled for permit approval or has been submitted for approval as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
d.  Land development activity that has not been submitted for approval, but that is part of a larger master development plan, such as for an office park or other phased development that has been previously approved within two years of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
(2)  Exemptions. Exemption of the activities set forth in this subsection does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property. The following specific activities are exempt from this article: 
a.  Activities for the purpose of building one of the following: 
1.  A stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route or utility line; 
2.  Public water supply intake or public wastewater outfall structures;

4.  Public access facilities that must be on the water including boat ramps, docks, foot trails leading directly to the river, fishing platforms and overlooks; 
5.  Unpaved foot trails and paths; 
6.  Activities to restore and enhance stream bank stability, vegetation, water quality and/or aquatic habitat, so long as native vegetation and bioengineering techniques are used. 
b.  Public sewer line easements paralleling the creek, except that all easements (permanent and construction) and land disturbance should be at least 25 feet from the top of the bank. This includes such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including, but not limited to, manholes, vents and valve structures. This exemption shall not be construed as allowing the construction of roads, bike paths or other transportation routes in such easements, regardless of paving material, except for access for the uses specifically cited in subsection (a)(2)a of this section. 
c.  Land development activities within a right-of-way existing at the time this article takes effect or approved under the terms of this article. 
d.  Within an easement of any utility existing at the time this article takes effect or approved under the terms of this article, land disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including, but not limited to, manholes, vents and valve structures. 
e.  Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report such work to the city manager or his designee on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within ten days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the city manager or his designee to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability or water quality of the protection area. 
f.  Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural uses and are not incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer. 
(b)  Prohibited activities. After the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, it shall apply to new subdividing and platting activities. Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to section 16-174(b). 
(Ord. No. 06-21, § 4, 10-2-2006)

(2)  An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback. 
(3)  No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback. 
(b)  Variance procedures. Variances from the buffer and setback requirements set forth in subsection (a) of this section may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
(1)  Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the city manager or his designee finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the board of zoning appeals of the city may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
(2)  Except as provided in subsection (b)(1) of this section, the city manager or his designee shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote by the board of zoning appeals of the city. The city manager or his designee shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The city manager or his designee shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
a.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this article prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
b.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements of this article would create an extreme hardship. 
Variances will not be considered when, following the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property.

b.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
c.  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
e.  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and 
h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
(4)  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; 
d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
e.  The longterm and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; and 
f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note— An ordinance adopted July 10, 2006, did not specifically amend the Code. Hence, inclusion as Ch. 16, Art. VI., Div. 4, §§ 16-286—16-293 was at the discretion of the editor. 

Sec. 16-286. - Introduction. 
It is hereby determined that: 
Discharges to the city separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
These nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the city separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. 
These nonstormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. 
The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the city separate storm sewer system; 
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the city separate storm sewer system; 
Therefore, the city adopts this division to prohibit such nonstormwater discharges to the city separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the city separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.

(1)  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
(2)  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity; 
(3)  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or 
(4)  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
(b)  Any development within the future-conditions floodplain allowed under subsection (a) of this section shall also meet the following conditions: 
(1)  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average groundwater table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average groundwater table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided by means of bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (predevelopment) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
(2)  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
(3)  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased;

Sec. 18-61. - Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. 
An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of section 18-88 apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the state and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the city prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
(1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
(2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the city. Cross sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available.

Sec. 18-62. - Floodway encroachments. 
Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (2) of this section; 
(2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
(3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the city until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the city.

After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner.

Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
(4)  The city may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county or municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property of the dwelling, building or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.

Sec. 24-102. - Findings/nuisance. 
The city council of the city further finds and declares that: 
(1)  Criminal street gang activity is present within the city and such presence creates a serious and continuing public safety concern to the citizens of the city; 
(2)  Criminal trespass and criminal damage to property in the second degree caused by graffiti being placed unlawfully upon private property are crimes frequently associated with criminal street gang activity; and 
(3)  It is in the public interest, not only in the pursuit of justice but also as a means of combating such criminal street gang activity and of contributing to the general public welfare by improving the esthetics of public views, to compensate as provided in this article those private property owners who are the innocent victims of such criminal trespass or criminal damage to property in the second degree by using inmate labor to remove or obliterate graffiti unlawfully placed on the private properties when such graffiti is visible from public roads or other public property. 
The city council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive of the rights and values of public and private property located in the city. The city council is enacting this article to help prevent the spread of graffiti and to establish a program for the removal of graffiti from public and private property. The city council for the city is authorized by its' charter and its' other enacted ordinances to enact such an ordinance as this to provide for the removal of such graffiti. Unless the city acts quickly to remove graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. 
The city council of the city further finds that there are buildings and other improvements within the city limits of the city upon which graffiti has been recently placed. The city council of the city also finds that the placing of graffiti on property, buildings and improvements within the city causes such neighborhoods and locations to become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city. Further, the city finds that rapid or prompt removal serves as a deterrent to future placement of graffiti and such graffiti is less likely to reappear. 
The city council intends through the adoption of this article to provide for additional enforcement tools to protect public and private property from acts of graffiti. The city of council does not intend for this article to conflict with any existing state laws concerning graffiti.

Sec. 28-1. - Purpose and findings. 
Be it ordained by the mayor and the city council of the City of Dallas that: 
(1)  The City of Dallas's population has grown substantially in recent years. With the increase in population has come a drastic and dramatic increase in the volume of traffic in the city. Uniform regulation of signage providing directional, commercial, and noncommercial information to the motoring public, to promote public safety, is essential. 
(2)  Various and diverse businesses are located within the City of Dallas. The need to advertise products and services must be balanced by the city's obligation to restrict clutter, maintain an aesthetically pleasing environment, protect property values, and enhance public safety. 
(3)  Regulation of the location, size, placement, and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services, and facilities in the city without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the community, to take advantage of the beauty of the community's natural environment, and to protect property values therein. Such regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of businesses in the city in the event of police, fire, or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies. Accordingly, it is the intention of the city to establish regulations governing the display of signs which will: 
a.  Promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare; 
b.  Enhance the economy and the business and industry of the city by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs; 
c.  Restrict signs and lights which increase clutter or which increase the probability of traffic accidents by obstructing vision; 
d.  Promote signs which are compatible with their surroundings; 
e.  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; 
f.  Maintain the historical image of the city; 
g.  Promote economic development; and 
h.  Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
(4)  It is also the purpose of this chapter to insure proper maintenance, for safety and structural soundness, as well as the appearance and attractiveness of signs. 
(5)  Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
(6)  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations.

State Law reference— Plat approval procedures for subdivisions near a part of the state highway system are regulated by, O.C.G.A. § 32-6-150; standards for maps and plats recorded in the office of the clerk of superior court are set in, O.C.G.A. § 15-6-67. 
Sec. 34-24. - Minimum design standards. 
(a)  Relationship to comprehensive plan for the city. In considering any development plan or final plat, the planning commission shall give consideration to the city comprehensive plan, as adopted or amended, as well as any existing land use plans that may have been approved by the mayor and city council that may affect the area in which the subdivision is to be located. 
(b)  Streets. The location and width of all streets and roads shall conform to this article, chapter 44, pertaining to zoning, the city comprehensive plan and any other adopted transportation plan that the city has adopted or will adopt in the future. All streets established in connection with the development of a subdivision shall comply with the following requirements: 
(1)  Continuation of existing street pattern. Whenever topography will permit, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall provide for the alignment and continuation or projection of adjoining areas at the same or greater width, but in no case, less than the required minimum width. 
(2)  Access restrictions. 
a.  When a subdivision fronts on an arterial street or highway, the city manager may limit access on double frontage lots to an interior street with no access to the arterial street. The subdivider must consult and receive approval from the state department of transportation for any access upon any street or road that is on the state DOT road system. 
b.  Where, in the opinion of the planning commission, it is essential to provide for street access to an adjoining tract or parcel of land, street right-of-way shall be extended to the boundary of such tract or parcel of land. 
c.  Every lot established shall front or abut on a street which is to be dedicated to the public and/or conforms to the provisions of this article. When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots (larger than one acre), such parcels shall be arranged so as not to landlock any parcel. 
(3)  Private streets. Private streets are only permitted within a private subdivision as defined in section 34-19. 
(4)  Cul-de-sac requirements. Cul-de-sacs shall terminate in a circular turnaround having a minimum right-of-way of 100 feet in diameter and a paved turnaround with a minimum outside diameter of 80 feet. Maximum street length with a cul-de-sac shall not be greater in length than 1,600 feet from the centerline of the access street to the point of radius, unless topographic conditions necessitate no alternative for access. A variance on any additional length of a cul-de-sac must be approved by the planning commission. 
(5)  Temporary dead-end streets. Temporary dead-end streets which extend for a distance greater than the depth of one abutting lot shall be provided with a paved temporary turnaround having a diameter of 80 feet, or other suitable turnaround. 
(6)  Half streets. Half streets are prohibited. Whenever a street is planned adjacent to the proposed subdivision tract boundary, the entire street right-of-way shall be platted within the proposed subdivision. 
(7)  Split level streets and one-way streets. Streets which are construed so as to have two traffic ways, each at a different level within the right-of-way, shall provide a paved traffic surface of at least 20 feet on each level and a slope between the two traffic ways of not less than three to one (3:1). One-way streets and split level streets will be allowed when: 
a.  Topographic conditions are so that alternatives to the typical street design and construction would be more desirable; 
b.  Shape and size of the parcel could be more efficiently developed. 
In either case, approval must be obtained from the planning commission with assistance from the city manager or a qualified engineer. 
(8)  Alleys. Alleys shall not be provided in residential blocks except where the subdivider produces evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of the need for alleys. Where alleys are permitted, they shall be graded and surfaced to specifications approved by the city manager. 
(9)  Intersections. 
a.  The centerline of no more than two streets may intersect at any one point. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible to right angles (90 degrees) and no street shall intersect any other street at an angle of less than 60 degrees. The angle of intersection is to be measured at the intersection of the street centerlines. Curved streets shall have a minimum tangent of 100 feet at intersections as measured from the centerline of the cross street. 
b.  Whenever necessary to permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radius without curtailing the sidewalk at a street corner to less than normal width, the property line at such street corners shall be round or otherwise set back sufficiently to permit sidewalk construction. 
c.  Islands at intersections shall be subject to individual approval by the city manager. In no case shall anything extend more than three feet above the back of the curb within the right-of-way of the intersecting street. 
d.  Adjoining street intersections shall be spaced at least 200 feet apart measured from edge of right-of-way to edge of opposing right-of-way. Street jogs at intersections shall have a centerline offset of not less than 150 feet. 
(10)  Street grade and curve design. Horizontal and vertical curve design shall be consistent with the city standard design specifications set forth in section 34-26. 
(11)  Street names and property address. 
a.  Streets or roads that are extensions of, or obviously in alignment with, existing named streets shall bear that same name. The names of new streets and roads, except in the same subdivision, shall not duplicate or be similar in sound to existing names, irrespective of the use of the suffix street, avenue, circle, way, boulevard, drive, place or court, or however otherwise designated. 
b.  All street names are subject to the approval of the city manager and/or the city post office. 
c.  Property address numbers shall be provided by the city manager and recorded on final plats. 
(12)  Additional right-of-way. Subdivisions which include an existing platted street or road that does not conform to the minimum right-of-way requirements of this article shall provide additional width along one or both sides of such street or road so that the minimum right-of-way required by this article is established, but only if the individual lots along said right-of-way have not been constructed upon. Subdivisions abutting only one side of such a street or road shall provide a minimum of one-half measured from the center of the existing right-of-way, of the right-of-way required by this article. 
(13)  Minimum right-of-way and pavement widths. Minimum right-of-way and pavement widths shall be as follows: 

 
Note— 
(1) Measured between face of the curbs. 
(2) To be determined by anticipated traffic loading. 
(14)  Preexisting right-of-way. Preexisting rights-of-way of at least 30 feet, either recorded in the county clerk's office or maintained by the city, are accepted as meeting the minimum width requirements of streets under this article. All other criteria for the roadway shall be met. This applies only to that portion of the tract from a public roadway to the main body of the property where the property on each side of the access is owned by a different individual and not the subdivider. 
(c)  Blocks. The planning commission shall examine every proposed subdivision as to its compliance with the following provisions: 
(1)  Nonresidential. Blocks for other than residential use shall be of such length and width as may be suitable for their prospective use, including adequate provision for off-street parking and service. 
(2)  Residential—Length. In order that there may be convenient access between various parts of a subdivision and between the subdivision and surrounding areas, and in order to help prevent traffic congestion and undue inconvenience, and to serve the efficient use of land or desired features of street patterns; the length of blocks hereafter established shall not exceed 1,800 feet nor be less than 600 feet; provided, however, such length requirements may be granted a variance by the planning commission when appropriate due to the topography or physical shape of the property being subdivided. 
(3)  Same—Width. The width of any residential block shall be sufficient to permit two tiers of lots of minimum depth except where prevented by topographical conditions or size of the property, in which case the planning commission may approve a single tier of lots of minimum dimensions. 
(d)  Lots. All lots which shall hereafter be established in connection with the development of a subdivision, shall comply with the following design standards: 
(1)  Authority of the health department, if public sewers not available. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed as preventing the health department, after a study of the conditions existing in a proposed subdivision, from requiring that all or any portion of the area of such subdivision: 
a.  Shall not be built upon; or 
b.  That the minimum lot sizes set forth in this article are inadequate and must be increased to ensure the protection of the public health. 
The developer is encouraged to consult with the health department regarding lot sizes prior to submitting a development plan. 
(2)  Building lines. All building lines and setbacks distances shall conform to chapter 44, pertaining to zoning. 
(3)  Within city limits. Lots shall not be divided by corporate boundary lines. 
(4)  Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently large to permit the location of buildings so as to conform with the building lines on both streets. All corner lots, regardless of zoning, shall have not less than 100 feet of road frontage on each street. The street side yard shall not be less than 25 feet measured from the street right-of-way line. No driveway shall be located within 60 feet of the street intersection. 
(5)  Side lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles (;pm;90 degrees) to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines on which the lot faces. Side lot lines shall be radial to the radius points of all cul-de-sacs. 
(6)  Minimum dimensions and area. Minimum lot dimensions and areas shall be in conformity with chapter 44, pertaining to zoning. 
(7)  Health requirements. Percolation tests and/or soil data as provided by a registered soil scientist shall be required and shall be approved by the health department, which may require additional lot area depending on soil and slope conditions. The minimum lot size for a septic tank sewer system shall be one-half acre. No septic tank sewer system will be allowed if public sewer can be made available with reasonable cost to the developer. All dwellings shall connect to public sewer if such sewer is within 300 feet of the property being subdivided. The cost of providing public sewer to the property shall be negotiated between the developer and the appropriate utility owner. 
(8)  Minimum frontage on five acre or more tracts. Lots that contain five acres or more must have a minimum frontage width of 60 feet upon a publicly maintained street or road. The city manager must certify that the topography of this 60 feet is suitable for the construction of a public road. 
(9)  Flood damage prevention. Each lot must have a suitable home site that is above the 100-year floodplain. The final plat must have a certification from the proper authority that this provision is complied with. 
(e)  Easements. Easements shall be required pursuant to the table set forth in this subsection for the following purposes: 
(1)  Utility. When it is found to be necessary and desirable to locate public utility lines in other than street rights-of-way, easements shall be shown on the plat for such purposes. The easements shall not be less than 15 feet in width and, whenever possible, shall be centered on rear and side lot lines. 
(2)  Watercourse and drainage. 
a.  Where a proposed subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, stream or channel, drainage easements shall be made to accommodate stormwater and drainage through and from the proposed subdivision. 
b.  Drainage easements shall conform substantially with the lines of the watercourse and shall be of sufficient width or construction to be adequate for the purpose and as necessary to accommodate future construction as recommended by the city manager. Drainage easements may be altered within the proposed site, but shall conform to points of discharge to and from the site upon approval of the city manager and the soil erosion and sedimentation plan. 
c.  Drainage easements shall be opened at the time of development to control surface water runoff. 
d.  Drainage easements off the street right-of-way shall be clearly defined on the plat and deed of the individual property owner and said property owner shall keep the easement free of obstructions and maintain that part of the easement within the property owner's boundary line so that free and maximum flow is maintained at all times. 
(3)  Water and sanitary sewer. Permanent water and sanitary sewer easements shall be a minimum of 20 feet in width and shall be provided for necessary lines. Sewer easements shall be ten feet on each side of the sewer main. 
(4)  Overlapping. Easements for water and sanitary sewer easements and drainage purposes shall not overlap unless approved by the city manager. 
(5)  Clearing and cover. All easements shall be cleared of debris, excess dirt and other materials. The ground shall be smoothed down and grassed within ten days of completing construction work. The use of sediment control measures may be required to protect the area until a vegetative cover is obtained. 
(6)  Identified. All easements shall be noted on the development plan, preliminary and final plats. 

 
(f)  Innovative land developments. 
(1)  General. Recognizing that beneficial change often comes from experimental design and developers' response to consumer demand, the mayor and city council and the city planning commission will consider innovative subdivision proposals which may deviate from approved subdivision regulations and standard design specifications as adopted by the city. The purpose and intent is to provide developers the flexibility of meeting consumer demand through innovative land developments and to ensure that the city remain competitive with other development markets. 
(2)  Requirements. 
a.  Preapplication review. Prior to the submittal of a development plan for an innovative subdivision, the developer shall meet with the city manager for a review of the location, scope and nature of the proposed development. The developer shall submit sketch plans showing how the property is to be developed. 
b.  Review of plats. The procedures of plat review shall be the same as outlined in this article for any development plan. 
c.  Water and sewer. All innovative land development proposals shall have public water and sanitary sewers available. 
(Comp. Ords. 2005, § 5-1605) 
Sec. 34-25. - Required improvements. 
(a)  Subdivider's responsibility. A well-designed subdivision means little to a prospective lot buyer until he can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise, a well-designed subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get usable products and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community, the subdivider shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by this article necessary to serve his subdivision. 
(b)  Monuments. Concrete monuments with aluminum or brass marking shall be placed at all corners of the exterior boundaries of the subdivision being developed and shall be set flush or up to six inches above finished grade. Existing permanent monuments which, in the professional opinion of a registered land surveyor or the city manager, are of sufficiently durable construction, may be maintained in lieu of a new concrete monument as described in this subsection. All other street or lot corners or at angle points and points of curve in each street shall be marked with an iron pipe or surveyor's marker at least 24 inches long and driven no less than one inch nor more than six inches above the finished grade. All such monuments shall be properly set in the ground and approved by a registered land surveyor prior to the time of final plat approval by the planning commission. 
(c)  Water supply. Where public water is available at the property being subdivided, the subdivider shall install water mains and fire hydrants according to plans and specifications approved by the city manager and/or other local, state, or federal regulations, specifications, or agencies. Fire protection systems shall be installed to current state insurance services office specifications and requirements. When the water main is located in the street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lot, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street. 
(d)  Sanitary sewerage. Where public sewerage is available within 300 feet of the property being subdivided and the topography is such that extension is feasible, the subdivider shall install public sanitary sewers to plans and specifications approved by the city manager and/or other local, state or federal agencies. When the sewer is located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line (terminating with a cleanout that will be set at finish grade upon landscaping) to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street. 
(e)  Private sewer disposal systems. Prior to the construction of any private community sewage disposal system such as an oxidation pond, land application system, or other type facility, the location, size, plans and specifications must be approved by the city manager and the state department of natural resources, environmental protection division. 
(f)  Sidewalks, curb and gutter. Sidewalks with a minimum width of five feet shall be installed on both sides of the street along all subdivision streets to provide a safe and convenient means for pedestrian movement. Developers shall also be required to construct sidewalks along existing public streets adjacent to the development property. Curbs and gutters shall be installed on all subdivision streets within the city. 
(g)  Street grading and surfacing. Streets shall be graded and surfaced according to plans and specifications approved by the city. 
(h)  Storm drainage and utilities. An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, storm sewers, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges and other necessary appurtenances shall be installed by the subdivider and shall conform to the standard design drawings and specifications as contained in this article. 
(i)  Street name signs. Street name signs shall be installed at all intersections within a subdivision. The location and design of such signs shall be approved by the city manager. 
(j)  Utility strips. The street right-of-way shall be graded at least six feet measured from the back of the curb or edge of pavement, on both sides of the street, to provide space for installation of utilities, to prevent the encroachment of driveways into the street surface, to provide walkways off the paved vehicular surface, and to provide space for the future installation of sidewalks; provided, however, the planning commission may waive this requirement in cases where the subdivider can demonstrate that the topography of the land being subdivided is such that compliance with this provision would be impractical. 
(k)  Street trees. The planting of street trees is not required; however, if the subdivider chooses to plant trees along the street to enhance the appearance of a subdivision, such trees shall not be planted on any street right-of-way to ensure that there will be no future conflict with utility lines either above or below the ground surface. Certain trees, however, are permitted on right-of-way subject to approval by the city manager if such species demonstrate growth characteristics which will not interfere with utilities. 
(l)  Street addresses. Numerals or letters indicating the official street address of each principal residence or business (as shown on the final plat), shall be installed by the subdividers of any subdivision either on a mailbox, mailbox post or other prominent place on the property so as to be visible to any emergency response unit trying to locate said residence or business. The numerals/letters shall be made of a durable reflective material, shall contrast in color with the background, and be at least three inches high for residences and four inches high for businesses. 
(m)  Streetlights. Prior to the sale of the first residence/business within any phase of the subdivision, there shall be street lights installed by the subdividers of any subdivision or by the electric utility company for that area, and the installation costs as well as the monthly charges shall be borne by the subdivider until 50 percent of the total residences/business within that phase have been sold. At that time the subdivider shall so notify the city manager who will in turn notify the respective electric utility company and transfer responsibility for payment to the city for that particular phase. 
(n)  Two-year warranty and final inspection. Developers of nonprivate subdivisions within the city shall provide the city with a two year warranty on the infrastructures (streets, curb and gutter, water, sanitary sewer, storm sewers, signage, etc.) that is required to be installed by this article. The developers shall be required to compensate the city for the cost of performing a final acceptance and public dedication inspection of the infrastructure improvements set forth in this article. The compensation shall be based on a fee of $50.00 per lot with a minimum fee of $2,500.00 and must be paid prior to the final acceptance and dedication inspection. The city shall have the right to use its own employees or to hire a certified engineering firm to perform the final acceptance and dedication inspection.

Construction plans for all facilities covered by this article shall conform to article IV of chapter 16, pertaining to erosion and sedimentation control. 
(c)  Administration and enforcement. 
(1)  Permits required. All phases of construction are guided by a permit process. Before obtaining a permit for the construction phases of subdivision improvement, a development plan must have been approved by the planning commission in accordance with this article. Plans for all other construction must be approved by the city manager. Permits will only be issued to the property owner, developer, or their authorized agent. The following types of construction are required to be reviewed: 
a.  Grading and storm drainage; 
b.  Water and sewer line construction; 
c.  Curb construction; 
d.  Base and paving construction. 
One permit shall be issued at the beginning of each construction activity. After inspection and approval of each phase, the developer may proceed with each subsequent phase. 
(2)  Field inspections. 
a.  Advance notice to city for inspection. Authorized representatives of the city shall access to the work site for inspection at any time. When an inspection for approval of the work is needed, the permittee shall notify the city manager at least eight hours in advance. After notification to the city and expiration of the eight-hour period, the work may proceed with or without the inspection. However, the city reserves the right to require modifications or corrections if said work does not conform to city regulations, specifications or ordinances. 
b.  Final inspection. Each type of construction identified in subsection (c)(1) of this section shall be inspected at the time of completion. In addition, each phase of construction shall be inspected before it is covered, built over, or otherwise hidden for inspection purposes by subsequent work. For example, subgrade preparation shall be inspected before any placement of base material, and base shall be inspected prior to the laying of pavement. When all construction has been completed, the developer or his agent shall meet with a representative from the city on the job site. All work will be examined at this time to ensure the work has been accepted and the construction plans checked against what has been constructed to ensure that the work is complete and proper. A final field inspection of all improvements shall be held before acceptance of the work. Nothing in this provision shall prevent the completion of a job pending inspection so long as the developer has given 24 hours' notice to the city that the work is to be completed at a given date and time. 
(3)  Letter of acceptance. If all work has been completed and is approved, a letter of acceptance will be issued by the city manager and/or the final plat be certified. Permits are not required when the work to be performed is by a city, county or state agency. 
(4)  Stop work order. Any work not having the proper permit or not conforming to the requirements of this article or any other city or state requirement must be brought into compliance. Should the work not be permitted or corrected after notification by the city manager, a stop work order shall be issued by the city manager. Further failure by the property owner or developer to comply shall make him liable for a $500.00 per day fine and charges of a misdemeanor. 
(d)  Earthwork. 
(1)  Clearing and grubbing. The entire area within the typical grading section shall be cleared and grubbed of all trees, bushes, stumps and debris. Such debris shall be disposed of in a satisfactory manner. 
(2)  Grading. Grading shall be accurately done to the lines and grades shown on the approved plans. Embankments shall be placed in uniform layers not to exceed six inches and compacted to a density of 95 percent of the maximum dry weight per cubic foot as determined by an approved method. Proof-rolling shall be accomplished prior to placement of embankments to detect soft spots. 

 
The depth of cut referenced in the table in this subsection shall be construed to be the maximum cut or fill occurring in any one section of cut or fill. The slope on cut or fill shall be uniform throughout for each section of cut or fill. When a cut is made in rock that requires blasting, slope may be changed to vertical slope upon the written approval of the city manager. 
(3)  Subgrade. After the earth work has been completed, all storm drainage and other underground utilities have been installed under the roadbed, and the backfill in all ditches thoroughly compacted, the subgrade shall be brought to the lines, grades and cross section shown on the plans. 
a.  If any sections of the subgrade are composed of unsuitable or unstable material, such material shall be removed to the depth directed by the city manager and replaced with suitable, thoroughly compacted material. 
b.  When the street is to be used for construction traffic before the paving work is completed, a layer of No. 5 stone can be laid as a traffic surface if the developer desires under the following provisions: 
1.  This material shall not be used as part of the base material; 
2.  It may be worked into the subgrade or it shall be removed before the base course is set up for paving; 
3.  Provision shall be made to drain low points in road construction when the final paving surface is delayed. 
(e)  Storm drainage. 
(1)  Standards. The following standards are to be used in designing the system: 
a.  Stormwater discharge rate. The development shall comply with the current best management practices for stormwater management as contained in engineering standards. 
b.  Size and location of drainage structures. The sizing and location of all drainage structures shall be the responsibility of a registered professional engineer or land surveyor, subject to the approval of the city manager. 
c.  Minimum velocity. Storm drainage pipes shall be sloped so as to maintain a minimum velocity of three feet per second so that sediment will not collect. 
d.  Gauge of pipe, backfill and installation. State department of transportation standard 1030D (or most current) shall be used in determining class (concrete) or gauge of pipe under fill, method of backfilling and pipe installation, unless otherwise specified and approved by the city manager. 
e.  Drainage formula. Unless specified otherwise, the drainage formula used in determining the size of the drainage structure shall be determined by the development's engineer or surveyor.

Sec. 34-28. - Roadway and infrastructure project improvements. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Infrastructure project improvement means a site improvement required to provide water distribution, sewer collection, stormwater management, or street lights within a specifically identified residential development that are necessary to bring the development into compliance with the standards set forth in the City of Dallas Development Regulations. Such an improvement is intended for the use and convenience of the occupants or users of the residential development alone and is not designed to provide service to the community at large. 
Infrastructure means the water distribution, sewer collection, stormwater management, and street light systems contained within the final plat for a residential development recorded with the Office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Paulding County. 
Roadway means the roadway contained within the final plat for a residential development recorded with the Office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Paulding County. 
Roadway project improvement means a site improvement to a substandard roadway contained within a specifically identified residential development that is necessary to bring the roadway into compliance with the standards set forth in the City of Dallas Development Regulations. Such an improvement is intended for the use and convenience of the occupants or users of the residential development alone and is not designed to provide service to the community at large. 
System improvement means an improvement designed to provide service to the community at large, in contrast to a roadway project improvement or an infrastructure project improvement. 
Vacant lot means a lot within a residential subdivision upon which no residential structure has been constructed or for which no certificate of occupancy has been issued by the city. 
(b)  Applicability. This article shall apply to those residential developments meeting the following criteria: 
(1)  A final plat for the development has been lawfully recorded in Office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Paulding County, but all or a portion of the roadways or infrastructure therein have not been accepted by the city for perpetual maintenance; 
(2)  All or a portion of the roadways or infrastructure shown on the final plat do not comply with the development regulations; and 
(3)  The bonds or other security instruments posted or which should have been posted for the residential development have failed to provide sufficient funds to the city for proper completion of the roadways and associated infrastructure within the residential development. 
(c)  Roadway and infrastructure project improvement fee. 
(1)  Where the city determines that a residential development meets the criteria set forth in subsection (b), the community development director may condition issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy for the remaining vacant lots within the development upon payment of a roadway and infrastructure project improvement fee. 
(2)  The roadway and infrastructure project improvement fee shall be determined by the community development director by dividing the anticipated costs to complete the residential development in compliance with the development regulations by the number of vacant lots existing within the residential development. Once the first roadway and infrastructure project improvement fee for a specific residential development is determined, the fee will remain constant for the remaining vacant lots within that residential development. 
(3)  No roadway and infrastructure project improvement fee may exceed $2,500.00. 
(d)  Expenditure of roadway and infrastructure project improvement fees. 
(1)  Roadway and infrastructure project improvement fees shall be used solely to pay for expenses incurred by the city in bringing the roadways and associated infrastructure of the specific residential development for which they were assessed into compliance with the development regulations. No such fees may be utilized for system improvements. 
(2)  Roadway and infrastructure project improvement fees shall be accounted for and categorized separately for each individual residential development for which they were assessed. 
(3)  Upon collection of sufficient roadway and infrastructure project improvement fees to bring the roadways and associated infrastructure of a residential development into compliance with the development regulations, the city may commence construction of the improvements; however this provision does not preclude the city from commencing such construction at an earlier date.

Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM C12, latest revision, except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected and approved. 
(5)  All joints and connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Push-on joints for cast-iron soil pipe shall have neoprene gaskets and be installed according to the manufacturer's recommendation. PVC pipe joint material shall be of the bell and spigot type, sealed with a rubber O-ring gasket, having a composition and texture which is resistant to the common ingredients of sewage, industrial wastes (including oils), and groundwater, and which will endure permanently under the conditions likely to be imposed by this use. Installation of gasket shall be done in accordance with the pipe manufacture's instructions using all the necessary materials, lubricants, and equipment recommended by the manufacturer. Other jointing materials may be used only when approved by the superintendent. 
(6)  The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the Y-branch, if such a branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less, and no properly located Y-branch is available, the city shall, at the owner's expense, cut a neat hole into the public sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45 degrees, and install a 45-degree elbow with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at an elevation of at least one-tenth foot above the invert of the public sewer. A neat smooth joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fittings may be use for the connection only when approved by the superintendent.

Contamination means any impairment of the quality of the city's potable water by the introduction or admission of any foreign substance, including, but not limited to, sewage, industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds or other materials, to a degree which degrades the quality of the potable water and creates an actual or potential hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of disease. 
Cross connection means any actual or potential physical connection or arrangement of piping or fixtures between two otherwise separate piping systems, one of which contains potable water and the other nonpotable water or industrial fluids of questionable safety, through which, or because of which, backflow may occur into the potable water system. Alternatively, it is a connection or potential connection between any part of a potable water system and any other environment containing other substances in a manner that might allow such substances (such as gasses, liquids, or solids) to enter the potable water system and to affect the water's taste, color or odor. This term includes, but is not limited to, any temporary connections, such as swing connections, removable sections, four-way plug valves, spools, dummy sections of pipe, swivel or changeover devices or sliding multiport tubes. 
Cross connection control by containment means any of the following: 
(1)  At service connection. The installation of one approved backflow prevention device at the water service connection to any customer's premises where it is physically and economically infeasible to find and permanently eliminate or control any or all actual or potential cross connections within the customer's water system. 
(2)  After service connection. The installation of an approved backflow prevention device on the service line leading to and supplying all or a portion of a customer's water system where there are actual or potential cross connections within the customer's premises which cannot be effectively eliminated or controlled at the point of the cross connection. 
Cross connections, controlled means a cross connection that has an approved backflow prevention device properly installed and maintained so that it will continuously afford protection commensurate with the degree of hazard. 
Customer means any owner of premises receiving city water system service or any end-user thereof, including any and all persons, natural or artificial, including any individual firm, association or trust and any municipal or private corporation organized or existing under the laws of this or any other state or country. 
Department means the city's water system. 
Double-check valve assembly means an assembly of two independently operating approved check valves with tightly closing shutoff valves on each end of the check valves, plus properly located test cocks for the testing of each check valve. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance specifications as determined by a laboratory and field evaluation program resulting in current approval of a recognized and approved testing agency for backflow prevention assemblies. To be approved, these devices must be readily accessible for inline testing and maintenance.

(6)  Contaminated natural waters emanating from wells, springs, streams, rivers, bays, harbors, seas, irrigation canals or systems. 
Pollution or polluted means the presence of any foreign substance (organic, inorganic, or biological) in water which tends to degrade the water's quality so as to constitute a hazard or to impair the usefulness or quality of the water to a degree which does not create an actual hazard to the public health, but which does adversely and unreasonably affect such water's domestic use. 
Reduced pressure principle device means an assembly of two independently-acting, approved check valves together with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent pressure relief valve located between the check valves and at the same time below the first check valve. The unit shall include properly located test cocks and tightly closing shutoff valves at each end of the assembly. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance specifications as determined by a laboratory and a field evaluation program resulting in current approval by a recognized and approved testing agency for backflow prevention assemblies. The assembly shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two check valves at an acceptable level less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the device. At cessation of normal flow the pressure between the two check valves shall be less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the device. In the event that either of the check valves leak, the differential relief valve shall operate to maintain the reduced pressure in the zone between the check valves by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two pounds per square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere. To be approved, these devices must be readily accessible for in-line testing and maintenance and be installed in a location where no part of the device will be submerged. 
Water, nonpotable, means water which is not safe for human consumption or which is of questionable potability.

Water purveyor means a supplier of water, including property owners supplying water for their own use. 
Water service connection means the terminal end of a service connection from the public potable water system (i.e., where the water purveyor loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the customer's water system). If a meter is installed at the end of the service connection, then the service connection shall mean the downstream end of the meter. The term "service connection" also includes the water service connection from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency water service connections from the public potable water system. 
Water system means the city water system and the customer's water system, where not specifically limited as such. The department system shall consist of the source facilities and the distribution system and shall include all those facilities of the water system under the complete control of the department, up to the point where the customer's system begins (at and including the water meter and any required backflow prevention devices used in conjunction therewith). The source facilities shall include all components of the facilities used in the production, treatment, storage, and delivery of water to the distribution system. The distribution system shall include the network of conduits used for the delivery of water from the source to the customer's system. The customer's system shall include those parts of the facilities beyond the termination of the department's distribution system which are used in conveying department-delivered domestic water to points of use. 
Water, used, means any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public potable water system to a consumer's water system after it has passed through the point of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary control of the water purveyor.

Secs. 44-172—44-195. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 4. - NEW TOWN OVERLAY DISTRICT 

Sec. 44-196. - Purpose, intent and authority. 
(a)  Title. This division shall be known as the "New Town Overlay District." 
(b)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this district to establish standards for the design of sites, buildings, structures, plantings, signs, street hardware and such other improvements that are visible to the public and affect the physical development of land within the designated New Town Overlay District in keeping with the city livable centers initiative (LCI) plan and the city's comprehensive plan. The following standards shall be considered in evaluating projects proposed within the New Town Overlay District: 
(1)  All structures will be evaluated on the overall appearance of the project and shall be based on the quality of its design and its relationship to the surrounding area. 
(2)  The quality of design goes beyond the materials of construction to include scale, mass, color, proportion, and compatibility with adjoining developments. 
(3)  Colors shall be harmonious and only the use of compatible accents shall be permitted. 
(4)  Building components, such as windows, doors, eaves, and parapets, shall have good proportions and relationships to one another. 
(5)  For any design in which the structure frame is exposed to view, the structural materials shall be compatible within themselves and harmonious with their surroundings. 
(6)  Monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be avoided. Variation of detail, form, and siting shall be used to provide visual interest. In multiple building projects, variable siting of individual buildings may be used to prevent a monotonous appearance. 
(c)  Statement of intent. These standards are intended to promote imagination and innovation to encourage the development of high quality, integrated, walkable developments with variety in the appearance of buildings and sites within the overlay district. These standards are further intended to preserve and enhance the character, quality, and longterm sustainability of development in the city and to promote the public health, safety and welfare by providing for consistent and coordinated treatment of the property encompassed within the overlay district. The city LCI report (2006) identified a strong community preference for the city to grow in a more cohesive, sustainable pattern. The overlay district regulations include controls regarding the design of buildings, sites, structures, parking areas, signage, transportation facilities (pedestrian and vehicular), open space/greenspace, and landscaping (trees and vegetation).

(3)  Structures longer than 100 feet in length shall create variations in the facade through varying the cornice height, facade depth, materials, textures, colors, and/or window and door patterns to provide visual interest and avoid imposing or monotonous facades. 
(4)  Exterior metal walls shall be prohibited on all buildings erected, constructed, altered, repaired or used in this New Town Overlay Zone, which abut, are adjacent to or are visible from any of the roadway corridors that define the district's boundaries. 
(5)  Building facades may be constructed from masonry (including brick), glass, and/or wood as defined below, or other materials or products which provide the same desired stability and quality. (Please note: Building facades to be regulated by this district include all building sides which are visible from any public street or sidewalk within the district.) Products other than the following listed products must be approved by the city: 
a.  Masonry construction. Masonry construction shall include all masonry construction that is composed of solid, faced, or veneered-wall construction (excluding masonry boards, concrete masonry units (CMU) and/or cinder blocks, unless otherwise approved by the city) with standard brick size. 
1.  Stone material used for masonry construction may consist of granite, sandstone, slate, limestone, marble, or other hard or durable all-weather stone. Ashlar, cut stone, and dimensioned stone construction techniques are acceptable. 
2.  Brick material used for masonry construction shall be composed of hard fired (kiln-fired) all weather standard size brick or other all weather facing brick. 
b.  Glass walls. Glass walls shall include glass curtain walls construction. Glass curtain wall shall be defined as an exterior wall which carries no floor or roof loads, and which may consist of a combination of glass and other surfacing materials supported in a metal framework. 
c.  Wood construction. Wood construction shall include wood siding, board and baton, and other traditional wood construction. Fiberboard (Hardiplank and/or similar products) may be allowed with approval of the city. Other synthetic siding material including vinyl siding and metal siding are prohibited as a facade material within the overlay district. 
(6)  The materials and finishes of exposed roofs shall compliment those used for the exterior walls. Exposed roofs shall be defined as that portion of a roof visible from ground level of any public roadway or public area (sidewalk and/or parking area) or residentially zoned or used area. 
(7)  Roof-mounted equipment (mechanical and all other) shall be screened from view. The appearance, materials, and color of roof screens shall be coordinated with the building to maintain a unified appearance. 
(8)  All building mechanical and electrical equipment located adjacent to the building and visible from any public roadway, public area (including sidewalks and/or parking areas), or a residentially zoned or used area shall be screened from view. Such screens and enclosures shall be treated as an integral element of the building's appearance and shall thus consist of materials and colors that are compatible with the building facade and/or dense landscaping. 
(9)  The exposed walls and roofs of buildings shall be maintained in a clean, orderly, and attractive condition; free of cracks, dents, punctures, breakage, and other forms of visible marring. Materials that become excessively faded, chalked or otherwise deteriorated shall be refinished, repainted or replaced. 
(10)  Refuse and waste removal areas, loading berths, service yards, storage yards, and exterior work areas shall be screened from view from public ways. 
(11)  Screening of service yards, ground mounted mechanical and electrical equipment, refuse/waste areas and other places that tend to be unsightly shall be accomplished by use of walls, fencing, planting, or combinations of these. Walls or fencing may be comprised of brick, stone, wrought iron or wood. No barbed wire, razor wire, chain link fence or similar elements shall be visible from any public area (roadway, sidewalk or parking area). Screening shall be equally effective in winter and summer. 
(b)  Relationship of buildings to site. 
(1)  Buildings shall be placed in close proximity to public roadways, shall relate to roadways and pedestrian sidewalk areas, and shall promote easy access from sidewalks into buildings. 
(2)  Setbacks and building edges shall be varied from building to building (up to ten feet in variation) to enhance visual interest and to prevent consistent building edges longer than 100 linear feet.

(4)  Pedestrian paths along public roadways may not be interrupted for more than 30 continuous linear feet by driveways. Pedestrian sidewalks/paths over driveways must be differentiated from driveway pavement through the use of another material or the same material with a different color and texture. 
(5)  Shared driveways serving multiple properties and inter-parcel access are strongly encouraged to minimize the number of driveways through pedestrian areas/sidewalks and the number of access points for each individual development and along major roadways. 
(6)  Deceleration lanes, except for those required by the department of transportation on federal or state controlled roadways, are not allowed within the New Town Overlay District. 
(7)  All new developments shall preserve a minimum of 15 percent of the development parcel as open space (natural or publicly accessible open space). The term "open space," as it relates to this requirement, does not include impervious surfaces with the sole exceptions of pedestrian sidewalks and multiuse trails. 
(8)  Plans for new developments and exterior alterations to any existing structures must include a detailed site plan that shows all sidewalks areas, parking areas, building footprints and entries, pedestrian paths from sidewalks and parking areas to building entries, clear transitions of the streetscape (sidewalks, landscaping and lighting) with adjacent parcels along all public roadways, and calculation of required open space. 
(9)  Parking areas shall be treated with decorative elements, building wall extensions, plantings, berms, or other innovative means so as to attractively landscape and/or screen parking areas from the view of public ways. 
(10)  Within the permissible limits of the applicable zoning district, the height and scale of each building shall be compatible with its site and existing (or anticipated) adjoining buildings. 
(11)  Newly installed utility services, and service revisions necessitated by exterior alterations shall be underground.

Sec. 44-218. - Parking requirements. 
Parking is to be discouraged between the required Greenbelt and the building(s) when other suitable areas for parking exist on the property; however, a maximum of 20 percent private parking may be permitted in the area between the Greenbelt and the planting on the periphery of the property. Efforts to break up large expanse of pavement are to be encourage[d] by the interspersing of appropriate planting areas wherever possible. The number of parking spaces required is established in the City of Dallas Zoning Ordinance, depending upon the zoning and the intended land use. Alternatives to the established parking requirements may be granted to developments which have a mixture of uses whose peak parking requirements do no[t] coincide in time and thereby may share parking spaces. The applicant shall provide expertly prepared justification for seeking such exception (i.e. a reference such as "share parking," Urban Land Institute). There shall be an appropriate number of parking spaces, accessible to the building(s) and identification as reserved for use by handicapped individuals, and these spaces shall be of sufficient width to accommodate their needs. All parking standards shall comply with the zoning ordinance. 
(Ord. No. OA-2012-04, 3-19-2012) 
Sec. 44-219. - Lighting requirements. 
In reviewing the lighting plan for a lot proposed to be developed in the corridor overlay district, factors to be considered by the city shall include but are not limited to: 
(1)  Safety provided by the lighting; 
(2)  Security provided by the lighting; 
(3)  Possible light spillage or glare onto adjoining properties or streets. (Down-shielding is encouraged and spillage or glare onto adjoining properties is prohibited); 
(4)  Attractiveness of the lighting standards and their compatibility with the overall treatment of the property; 
(5)  Height amid placement of lighting standards considering the use (maximum height of 30 feet); and 
(6)  Exterior lighting, when used, shall enhance the building and the adjoining landscape. Lighting standards and building fixtures shall be of a design and size compatible with the building and adjacent areas. Lighting shall be restrained in design and excessive brightness avoided. 
(Ord. No. OA-2012-04, 3-19-2012) 
Sec. 44-220. - Access to individual sites. 
The Corridor streets by their functional nature as primary thoroughfares, must have reasonable restrictions as to the number and location of access points within the overlay districts. 
State Road 6 (Jimmy Campbell Parkway) represents a major thoroughfares, which must be controlled as to the number of access points ('curb cuts') permitted. 
Therefore, in order to provide safe and sufficient traffic movement to and from adjacent lands and to protect the functional integrity of the corridors primary thoroughfares, in many cases frontage roads, access roads and distributors roads, will have to be built. Such roads shall be coordinated with those of continuous lots and designed to preserve the aesthetic benefits provided by the greenbelt areas. Access at the side or rear of buildings is encouraged. New access points onto the primary thoroughfares in the corridor shall be coordinated with existing access points whenever possible. The following curb cut policy shall apply throughout all corridors: 
Access to proposed developments shall be provided per Georgia Department of Transportation and the City of Dallas access management standards, policies, guidelines and regulation. 
(Ord. No. OA-2012-04, 3-19-2012)

(b)  Loading berth requirements. Loading berth requirements shall be a[s] specified in the underlying zone district(s) except that any loading or unloading berth or bay shall be screened from view beyond the site by landscaping or other screening. 
(c)  Accessory buildings and uses. All accessory buildings and uses which are permitted in the underlying zoning district(s) shall be permitted within the corridor overlay districts, except that any detached accessory building on any lot shall be designed to be architecturally designed and constructed with the same material as the principle building and to be compatible with the principle building which it is associated. All accessory buildings shall have a roof. 
(d)  Paving requirements. All parking areas shall be finished with a hard surface such as asphalt, concrete or other materials approved by the city.

(Comp. Ords. 2005, § 5-1805; Ord. No. 96-17, 8-5-1996) 
Sec. 44-239. - Off-street parking and loading requirements.

Sec. 44-240. - Conditional zoning. 
(a)  Policy and definition. The city recognizes that in certain instances, in order to provide compatibility of land use with the use of surrounding property and/or to provide buffer zones between dissimilar property uses, it is desirable that a change of property use from one use district to another (hereinafter referred to as a "rezoning") is subject to certain conditions which would limit the use to which such property could otherwise be put. For such reason, any rezoning of a tract of land from one use district to another may be made contingent upon certain conditions as may be deemed appropriate by the mayor and council. Such contingent rezoning shall be known as "conditional zoning." 
(b)  Procedure. Conditional zoning may take place at the request of the property owner or at the instance of the mayor and council, as hereinafter set forth: 
(1)  Whenever any application for rezoning is supported by specific plans and/or designs for a particular development and/or use, such application shall be deemed to be an application for conditional zoning. The mayor and council may, after public hearing and recommendation by the city planning commission, approve such rezoning as a conditional zoning. If such conditional zoning is granted, the building inspector shall issue a building permit for the development of such property only in strict compliance with the plans and/or designs submitted. 
a.  Whenever such conditional zoning is granted, the applicant shall furnish two copies of such specific plans and/or designs, one of which shall be made a part of the ordinance or resolution granting such conditional zoning, and the other of which shall be furnished to the building inspector for his use. 
b.  If for any reason the development and/or use of the subject property in accordance with the submitted plans and/or designs cannot be accomplished, such plans and/or designs shall not be altered, changed, or varied except after the express authority of the mayor and council. 
c.  Unless substantial progress has been made toward the development and/or use of the subject property within 12 months of the granting of the conditional zoning, the zoning classification of such property shall revert to its status immediately prior to the granting of the conditional zoning. 
(2)  Whenever any application for rezoning is made, whether or not accompanied or supported by specific plans and/or designs, the mayor and council shall have the right to condition the grant of such application on such reasonable conditions as it may deem necessary to ensure the compatibility of the use of such land with the use of surrounding land, and to ensure the use of such land in conformity with the overall land use scheme within the city. The conditions which may be placed upon the use of such property may be as follows: 
a.  The requirement of buffer zones or strips, as well as the size of such buffer zones and use of certain plants or fencing on such buffer zones; 
b.  Limitation as to the portion of the lot or tract upon which a building or buildings may be constructed; 
c.  The size of the building or buildings to be constructed thereon; 
d.  The density of land use; 
e.  Architectural design of the building or buildings to be constructed thereon; 
f.  Setback requirements; 
g.  Specific use to which the property may be put; 
h.  Limitation on the size, number, or design of signs which may be placed on such property. 
(3)  Whenever the mayor and council shall grant an application for rezoning and shall place conditions upon such rezoning, the rezoning shall be deemed to be a conditional zoning, and the subject property may be developed only in strict compliance with such conditions. Any such conditions placed thereon shall be made a part of the ordinance or resolution by which such conditional zoning is granted.
