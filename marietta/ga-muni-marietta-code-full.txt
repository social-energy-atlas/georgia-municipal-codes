PREFACE 
This volume contains the City Charter, Related Laws and the Code of Ordiances of the City of Marietta, Georgia. The Code of Ordinances is an entirely new codification of all ordinances of a general and permanent nature. All obsolete, illegal, or superseded ordinances have been repealed as part of the codification. The Code has been adopted by the mayor and council through the enactment of a single ordinance and thus constitutes the general body of ordinance enactments of the city. 
The Code includes several features that will facilitate its use. The various chapters and articles of the Code follow one another in a natural, logical order. The table of contents, with a complete outline of this order, will often provide sufficient reference points for the reader, in addition, the reader may consult the index at the end of the volume. At the beginning of each Part there is a section analysis of chapters and articles within the Part. 
Non-textual provisions such as severability clauses, repeal, and enacting clauses are omitted from the text but are covered in Part 1 of this Code that applies to the entire Code of Ordinances. In most instances, references to "this ordinance" in the text of an ordinance have been changed to "this chapter" or "this article" as deemed appropriate. Various editorial notes such as state law references and cross references have been included throughout the Code to clarify its provisions. 
This Code is designed to serve as a complete compilation of ordinances and as a reliable reference guide. The citations included at the end of sections refer to the official source and date of former code sections and original ordinances. Sections of the Code which do not have a citation represent new ordinances that have been added to fill gaps or to replace ordinances which have become outdated. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a part of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the part. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
The 1996 codification was published by Book Publishing Company, Seattle, Washington. In February, 1999, Municipal Code Corporation, republished the Code of Marietta, Georgia and assumed supplementation.

The ordinance authorizing the paving, repaving, improving or reimproving of any sidewalk, street, avenue, alley or other public place under the provisions of this division shall describe the general character of improvement to be made, the material to be used and such other matters as shall be necessary to enable the preparation of the proper plans and specifications for the improvement proposed to be made; and pending the consideration of such ordinance an advertisement shall be inserted at least one (1) time in the newspaper in which the advertisement of sheriff sales in the county are published before the final passage of such ordinance, such advertisement giving notice of the introduction of such ordinance, the sidewalk, street, avenue, public alley, public place or portion thereof to be paved, repaved or improved, the estimated cost per front foot; and it shall set forth that the property owners or others interested are notified to appear at a meeting of the council to be held at a time stated in said advertisement and make any objection that they may desire to urge against the passage of such ordinance; a copy of said advertisement shall be mailed to each person whose post office address is known 15 days before said meeting for hearing objections. At the time named in said advertisement, if any property owner or other person desires to make objection to the passage of such ordinance, full opportunity shall be given at said meeting and after hearing objections, if any are made to the passage of such ordinance, said council shall have the right and power, in its discretion, to order such pavement, repavement or other improvement to be made, or it may decline to pass said ordinance. After the passage of such ordinance any person subject to assessment for the cost of such improvement who does not, within 15 days thereafter, begin legal proceedings to prevent said assessment being made shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the terms of said ordinance, and shall have agreed that the assessment provided for may be made. Thereupon it shall be the duty of said council to forthwith cause said improvement to be made in accordance with the plans and specifications as prepared. When completed an ordinance shall be passed, assessing the cost of said improvement as provided in this division. The assessing ordinance shall thereupon assert a lien upon each portion of the property abutting upon such paving, repaving or improvement for the amount of the assessment, against the owner thereof, to date back to the approval of the original ordinance and declare the same at the time said ordinance is passed. 
(Ga. L. 1977, p. 3541, Sec. 7.35) 
Section 7.36 - Assessment notice, payments. 
After the adoption of the ordinance assessing the cost a written statement shall be furnished by the clerk of the city to each abutting owner subject to the assessment, herein provided for, showing his pro rata part of such assessment and it shall be the duty of such person, so notified, to pay said clerk within 30 days after the receipt of such statement, the entire amount of the assessment against such person; provided that any person so notified shall have the right to pay the assessment so levied in five (5) installments to be paid as follows: 20 percent within 30 days after the receipt of said notice and the remaining 80 percent in four (4) annual installments of 20 percent each, such deferred payments to be evidenced by promissory notes bearing interest from date until paid at the rate of seven percent (7%) per annum, payable annually, and to said council or order. The benefit of the payment by installment may be taken advantage of by any such property owner by giving notes for the deferred payments as herein provided at the time of making the cash payment. In the event any property owner shall desire to pay the balance due under such assessment after exercising the option to pay installments as hereinbefore provided at any time before the maturity of such installments, such party so wishing and offering to pay shall pay the principal and interest due up to date of payment. 
The notice for assessment herein provided for shall be served personally upon each of said property owners (each agent of such company or corporation) residing within the limits of said city, and where such owner or agent is a nonresident of said city it will be sufficient service that said notice or statement be mailed to said property owner or agent at the last post office address of said owner or agent known to said clerk. In the event such owner or agent is not known it will be sufficient to serve said notice upon any person in possession of the property by reason of which such assessment is made.

Section 7.37 - Execution; levy; sale.

Said execution when issued, shall be delivered to the chief of police, who shall execute the same by levying and selling the property described therein for the amount due, together with all costs that may accrue thereon. The law applicable to sales under other executions issued by said city shall apply as to the levy, notice, advertisement and sale made under said execution, and said chief shall have authority to execute deeds when the property is sold, and deliver the immediate possession thereof to the purchaser.

When the chief of police shall receive said affidavit of illegality as herein provided for, he shall return the same to the clerk of the superior court where it shall be tried at the first term of the court under the law of this state that is applicable to the trial of illegalities, and subject to the penalties provided by statute where affidavits of illegality are filed for delay.

Section 3.206 - Proceeds of bonds. 
The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, which unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund hereinafter provided for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds. 
(Ga. L. 1951, p. 497, Sec. 10)

Any resolution, providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the authority by a majority of its members. 
(Ga. L. 1951, p. 497, Sec. 13) 
Section 3.210 - Credit not pledged. 
Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of Cobb County or the City of Marietta or a pledge of the faith and credit of either subdivision, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not indirectly or contingently obligate either the said county or city to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for the payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. 
(Ga. L. 1951, p. 497, Sec. 14) 
Section 3.211 - Trust indenture as security. 
In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefore [therefor] and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depositary of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depositary and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
(Ga. L. 1951, p. 497, Sec. 15) 
Section 3.212 - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
The authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who or any agency, bank or trust company which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. 
(Ga. L. 1951, p. 497, Sec. 16) 
Section 3.213 - Sinking fund. 
The revenues, fees, tolls and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture, into a sinking fund which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payments of (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of paying agents for paying principal and interest, and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued. 
(Ga. L. 1951, p. 497, Sec. 17) 
Section 3.214 - Remedies of bondholders. 
Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished. 
(Ga. L. 1951, p. 497, Sec. 18) 
Section 3.215 - Refunding bonds. 
The authority is hereby authorized to provide by resolution for the issue of revenue refunding bonds of the authority for the purpose of refunding any revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act and then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon. The issuance of such revenue refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority in respect to the same, shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this act insofar as the same may be applicable. 
(Ga. L. 1951, p. 497, Sec. 19) 
Section 3.216 - Venue and jurisdiction. 
Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this act or any suit or action against such authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Cobb County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions. 
(Ga. L. 1951, p. 497, Sec. 20) 
Section 3.217 - Validation.

The bonds when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds, against the authority issuing the same, and any municipality, county, authority, subdivision or instrumentality contracting with the said Cobb County-Marietta Water Authority. 
(Ga. L. 1951, p. 497, Sec. 21) 
Section 3.218 - Interests of bondholders protected. 
While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties or existence of said authority or of its officers, employees or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interests and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. The provisions of this act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds, and upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions hereof, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.

Section 4.202 - Members; terms; election; recall. 
(a)  The authority shall be composed of eight (8) members to be appointed and elected as hereinafter provided. One (1) member of the authority shall be the ex officio Mayor of the City of Marietta and one (1) member of the authority shall be ex officio Chairman of the Board of Commissioners of Cobb County. Three (3) members of the authority shall be elected by the owners of the property which is subject to the tax provided for in section 4[4.204] of this act. The remaining three (3) members of the authority shall be elected by the owners of business establishments with a licensed place of business located within the Downtown Marietta District. The initial three (3) members of the authority elected by each group of such owners, as provided above, shall serve for terms of office of one (1), two (2) and three (3) years, respectively. Thereafter, all terms of office of members of the authority shall be for three (3) years, except for the mayor and the Chairman of the Board of Commissioners of Cobb County. 
(b)  (1) The initial members of the authority to be elected by the property owners and owners of businesses, as provided above, shall be elected in a caucus of each respective owner group, which caucus shall be held within 60 days after this act becomes law and at such time and place as the Mayor of the City of Marietta shall designate after due notice thereof shall have been given to the respective owners. Thereafter, there shall be conducted annually a caucus of each owner group at such time and place as the authority shall designate after having given due notice thereof to the participants for the purpose of electing successors to the initially elected members of the authority. The due notice requirement in this subsection may be met by giving written notice mailed to the last address shown, (1) on the ad valorem tax records of the City of Marietta for the preceding year for owners of property in the Downtown Marietta District, and (2) on the business license records of the City of Marietta for the preceding year for owners of businesses in the Downtown Marietta District with a licensed place of business located within the Downtown Marietta District, at least 10 days prior to the caucus of the owner group given such notice, together with notice published once a week during the two (2) calendar weeks immediately preceding said caucus in the newspaper in Cobb County in which sheriff's advertisements appear. Fifteen percent of the members of each owner group caucus shall constitute a quorum, and any action may be approved by a majority of those present and voting. The lack of a quorum of one owner group shall not prohibit the other owner group from electing a successor, provided that group has a quorum. 
(2)  Each property owner shall have one (1) vote regardless of the number of parcels of property owned by such owner, except as otherwise set forth in this subsection. If a parcel of property is owned by more than one (1) person, the vote of the "owner" of that property shall be the vote of the majority of owners; provided, however, that if one of the owners is voting due to his ownership of another parcel, the vote of the "owner" of that property shall be the vote of the majority of the remaining owners. If a parcel of property is owned by a partnership or association, the vote of the "owner" of the property shall be the vote of a majority of the partners or members. A partner or member of an association is the only person empowered to vote for the partnership or association and the partner or member shall not be able to vote for more than one (1) partnership or association. If a parcel of property is owned by a life tenant and remainderman, they shall be considered a partnership for voting purposes. If a parcel of property is owned by a minor or in trust for a minor, the parent, guardian, or trustee shall be empowered to cast the vote for the minor or trust. If a parcel of property is owned by a person who has been adjudicated incompetent, the guardian shall be entitled to cast the vote for said person. If the property is owned by an estate, the vote of the estate shall be exercised by an executor or administrator of the estate. If the property is owned by a corporation, the vote of the corporation shall be exercised by the president or, in his absence, such other officer as may be empowered to vote by the president or the board of directors of the corporation upon proof thereof being submitted to the authority. Should the name of the individual who is voting not appear on the property owner list furnished by the city, the person conducting the election may require proof of ownership of property within the district by presentation of a copy of the owner's deed and, if the entity is a partnership, association, or corporation, a copy of the partnership agreement or minutes of the meeting designating such person as the voting owner, member, or officer. 
(3)  The owner of a business establishment with a licensed place of business located within the Downtown Marietta District shall have one (1) vote regardless of the number of places of business located therein. If a business is owned by more than one (1) person, the vote of the "owner" of that business shall be the vote of the majority of owners. If the business is owned by an association or a partnership, the vote of the "owner" of that business shall be the vote of the majority of the partners or members of the association. If the business is owned by an estate, the vote of the "owner" of that business shall be cast by an executor or administrator of the estate. If the business is owned by a corporation, the vote of the "owner" of that business shall be exercised by its president or such other officer as may be empowered to vote by the corporation's president or board of directors upon proof thereof being submitted to the authority. If the name of the individual who is voting does not appear on the business owner list provided by the city, the person conducting the election may require that business owner to submit a copy of his, her, or its business license or a receipt from the purchase of the business and, if there is more than one (1) owner, minutes of the meeting designating such person as the voting owner, member, or officer, provided this list shall not authorize a vote for one on said list who does not hold a current valid business license in the Downtown Marietta District. 
(4)  All votes shall be exercised in person by owners whether individuals, designated voting partners, designated voting members of an association, guardians, trustees, parents of a minor, or officers of a corporation, and no votes by proxy shall be permitted. 
(5)  To be qualified to be an elected member of the authority, an individual must be eligible to vote in the owner group by which he is elected. If an elected member of the authority is no longer an eligible voter in the group which he is elected to represent, such ineligibility shall automatically vacate the position he holds. A special election to fill any vacancy shall be held at the next annual caucus of owners or earlier if a date for the special election is set by a majority of the remaining members of the authority. Alternatively, any vacancies in office on the board of the authority may be filled by vote of the remaining members of the board at any meeting, such appointed member to serve until the next annual caucus of owners, when the vacancy shall then be filled by a special election held simultaneously with the regular election to fill the unexpired term. 
(c)  In the event that 20 percent of the total number of the members of any owner group shall petition the authority, the authority shall call a caucus for the purpose of recalling any member named to the authority by such group. At such a caucus, if a majority of those owners present and voting shall vote to recall any such member of the authority, such owner group shall elect a successor to such recalled member to serve out the term of office formerly occupied by the recalled member. No petition for the recall of any single member of the authority shall be filed within a 12 month period subsequent to the filing of any previous referendum for the recall of such member. 
(d)  All persons required to give notice of meeting and caucus dates shall exercise reasonable care so that as nearly as practical all persons entitled to notice of such meeting shall be apprised of such times and places. 
(e)  Any four (4) members of the authority shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of the ordinary business of the authority; however, any resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds, notes or other obligations for any project of the authority must be approved by a majority vote of the members of the authority.

CHAPTER 3-8 - REVENUE AND TAXATION 
ARTICLE 3-8-2 - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

3-8-2-010 - Collection of taxes and other revenue. 
All taxes, fees, penalties, fines or other revenue due the city shall be paid to the office of the city manager or a designee of the city manager. Any city employee collecting any moneys due the city or receiving such moneys for any reason shall promptly deliver such moneys to the office of the city manager or a designee of the city manager. 
(Code 1978, § 3-3001; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96) 
3-8-2-020 - Taxation. 
A.  Administration. 
1.  Except as otherwise provided, the finance director or his or her designee shall be charged with the duty to administer the imposition, collection and enforcement of all taxes and special assessments levied or imposed by the city in accordance with the administrative procedures hereinafter set forth. To the extent this code section fails to provide a designated procedure, said officer shall act in the manner established, if any, for county tax collectors under applicable state law. 
2.  In determining the fair market value of property within its taxing jurisdiction, the city shall use the fair market value as finally determined for the property for county ad valorem tax purposes. 
3.  Following adoption of its current fiscal year budget, the mayor and council shall, by ordinance, adopt a millage rate upon which property subject to ad valorem tax will be billed. Prior to adoption of said millage rate, the governing body shall publish the notice of proposed ad valorem tax rate as required by O.C.G.A. Section 48-5-32. Millage rates shall be calculated using forty (40) percent of the assessed fair market value of the property upon which the tax is levied. 
4.  The finance director shall issue a bill to be sent to all taxpayers at the address last shown on the county tax digest by regular U.S. mail, with adequate postage thereon; provided, however, failure by the taxpayer to receive a bill shall not constitute grounds for nonpayment or late payment of the tax. The bill shall state the location or description of the property taxed, the fair market value of the property one hundred (100) percent and its taxable value (forty (40) percent of fair market value), and the amount of tax due thereon. The bill shall also state the due date after which taxes shall be in default. The bill may also contain such additional information as allowed by law or authorized by the mayor and council. 
B.  Due Date; Payment; Interest on Past Due Taxes. 
1.  All ad valorem taxes shall be due and payable in full within sixty (60) days after notice, unless the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which case it shall be postponed until the first day following which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday. Supplemental ad valorem taxes and special assessments shall be due and payable on the date set forth in the ordinance imposing the tax or assessment. 
2.  All taxes and assessments imposed by the city shall be paid in full in legal tender of the United States, including electronic payments via credit and debit cards; except where specifically authorized by law or ordinance of the mayor and council, no partial payments shall be accepted. 
(a)  The cost associated with the acceptance of electronic payment(s) shall be processed and received by a third-party vendor via convenience and/or service fees and shall be sufficient to cover such costs. 
3.  Taxes and special assessments shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month from the date the tax or assessment is due until the date the tax or assessment is paid. For purposes of this section, any period of less than one month shall be considered to be one full month. The finance director may waive the collection of any interest, in whole or in part, due the city on unpaid taxes or assessments whenever or to the extent that he or she reasonably determines that the delay in payment was attributable to the action or inaction of his or her department. 
C.  Penalties. 
1.  All penalties imposed herein are part of the tax or assessment and are to be collected as such. The proceedings to collect the original tax, the tax constituted from penalties imposed, and the interest shall all be conducted in the same manner. Any provision of law for criminal prosecution shall not operate to relieve any taxpayer of any tax, penalty, or interest imposed herein. 
2.  In any instance in which any taxpayer fails to pay a tax or assessment within ninety (90) days of the due date, he shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax due, together with interest as specified herein. 
3.  The mayor and council may waive, in whole or in part, the collection of any amount due as a penalty under this code section to the extent said body finds and determines the default giving rise to the penalty was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect or disregard of this code section. 
D.  Executions on Delinquent Taxes and Assessments. 
1.  As soon as the last day for the payment of taxes and assessments has arrived, the finance director shall notify in writing the taxpayer of the fact that the taxes have not been paid and that, unless paid within thirty (30) days, an execution shall be issued. 
2.  The finance director shall issue executions for the nonpayment of taxes and assessments at any time after thirty (30) days have elapsed since giving notice as provided in subsection (D)(1) of this section. The execution shall identify the defendant in fi. fa., (taxpayer), the year(s) for which delinquent taxes are being executed, and the amount thereof. Executions shall be directed to "all and singular sheriffs and constables of the state". 
3.  The finance director shall cause all executions issued to be recorded on the general execution docket of the county where the property is located, in the case of real property, and, in the case of personal property, in the county of the taxpayer's residence if a resident of the state, otherwise in the county where any real or personal property of the taxpayer may be found. If the taxpayer is not a resident of the state and has no known real or personal property within the state, the execution shall be recorded in the county in which the act or activity giving rise to tax liability took place. 
4.  All executions issued shall continue to bear interest and penalties at the rates established in this ordinance for past due taxes and assessments. 
5.  The finance director shall cause all executions issued to be placed in the hands of the police chief for collection or levy and sale of property. The police chief shall exercise his best efforts to collect the full amount of taxes and assessments due, together with all interest, penalties, and any costs due thereon, from the defendant in fi. fa. In the event he is unable to do so, the police chief shall levy the execution on a sufficient amount of the defendant in fi. fa.'s property, whether real or personal, to satisfy the obligations due at a sale to be held and conducted in accordance with this code section. 
E.  Levy of Executions; Sale of Property. 
1.  The police chief is hereby designated as the marshal of the City of Marietta and delegated the duties set forth herein. The police chief shall be subject to being ruled for money in his hands arising from the public sale of any property pursuant to process issued by the municipality. After first paying the finance director the amount due on the process under which the sale was made, the marshal shall pay any surplus to any lawful claimant holding an interest subordinate to the lien for taxes, else to the defendant in fi. fa. 
2.  In all cases of levying on real property, within five days written notice of the levy must be given personally, or delivered by certified mail, to the defendant in fi. fa. and to any tenants in possession. If the land is unoccupied, a copy of the notice of levy shall also be conspicuously posted on the land. In the case of personal property, the marshal enter the same on the execution and plainly describe the property levied on and the amount of the interest of the defendant in fi. fa. therein. 
3.  Whenever any real property is levied upon for taxes or assessments, it shall be the marshal's duty before proceeding to advertise the property for sale to give twenty (20) days' written notice of the levy to the record owner(s) of the property and the holder of each security deed of record. The twenty (20) day period shall begin to run from the time the notice is personally delivered or, when delivered by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, from the date of mailing. The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the owner of the land, the year or years for which the taxes were assessed, and a statement of the amount of the taxes due, together with accrued costs. The marshal shall keep a copy of the notice on which he shall enter the date the notice was delivered or mailed and how, where, and to whom the notice was delivered. The marshal shall file the copy with the finance director. 
4.  When a levy is made upon real or personal property, the property shall be advertised and sold by the marshal in the same manner as provided for executions and judicial sales; provided, however, in addition to such other notice as may be required by law, the defendant in fi. fa. shall be given at least ten days written notice of such sale by registered or certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the taxpayer at the last known address listed in the records of the county tax commissioner. In addition, if the United States has a claim or lien on the property subject to being sold and such lien was filed or recorded more than thirty (30) days before the proposed sale, the marshal shall cause written notice of the sale to be given to the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate not less than twenty-five (25) days before the sale. Notice may be given either by personal service or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. 
5.  The police chief shall publish weekly for four weeks in the official legal organ of the county in which the sale will be conducted an advertisement of the date, place, and hours during which the sale will be conducted, together with a full and complete description of the property to be sold, making known the names of the property owner(s) of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state the property is being sold for collection of taxes due to the City of Marietta and the year(s) for which taxes have been executed. 
6.  Sales of property under execution shall be made by the marshal before the city hall on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. eastern standard time or eastern daylight savings time, which is applicable, and at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash; provided, however, should the first Tuesday of the month fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sales shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. The purchaser shall look for himself as to the title and soundness of all property sold under tax executions and neither the marshal conducting the sale, nor the City of Marietta, make any representations or warranty of title, condition, or fitness for a particular purpose, expressed or implied. 
7.  The marshal shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash and, upon collection of the sales price, make a deed or bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who becomes the purchaser of any property sold at the sale, who fails or refuses to comply with the terms of sale when requested by the marshal to do so, shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money. It shall be the option of the marshal either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and then proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. A tax deed for real property, or bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered as evidence of a sale for taxes conducted pursuant to this code section shall convey the title as effectually as if the sale were made by the person against whom the process was issued. Sales of personal property shall be final; real property sold by virtue of an execution issued for the collection of taxes or for any special assessments is subject to redemption rights of the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property at the time of levy or sale. Recitals in a deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the instrument. The marshal shall put the purchaser in possession of the property so sold; provided, however, the purchaser of real property is not entitled to be placed in possession until after the time for redemption has expired. 
8.  Whenever no bids are forthcoming on property sold for taxes after the property has been offered a reasonable time, the marshal may either re-advertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The marshal shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and exposed for sale has been abandoned due to lack of bids. 
F.  Bidding by City at Tax Sales; Disposition of Property Acquired. 
1.  If, during any sale of property for taxes and after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no one present at the sale bids an amount for the property being sold which is as much as the total of the taxes due (including any priority liens for taxes due the state, county and school and other special tax districts of the state) plus the marshal's cost due on the sale, then the city manager, or his designee, may purchase the property for the City of Marietta. If the city purchases property at a sale, the marshal shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city manager. The marshal shall put the city in possession of the property so sold. 
2.  Property acquired by the city pursuant to a sale for taxes or assessments may be divested or alienated by the city only by public sale of the property to the highest bidder, however, when the city has not parted with title to the property, the city may quitclaim the property to the owner at the time of the tax sale, or to the owner's administrators, executors, heirs, or assigns, upon full payment of the redemption price provided in herein. 
3.  The right of redemption in real property purchased by the city at a tax sale shall be foreclosed in the manner set forth herein. 
G.  Accounting by Marshal; Final Return or Settlement. 
1.  The marshal shall make a prompt accounting to the finance director for all executions placed in his hands for collection or levy and sale. He shall pay to the finance director all amounts due the city for taxes and assessments, interest, penalties, and costs, and shall file a final written return or settlement showing the amounts so paid, together with disposition of any excess proceeds derived from the sale. If there is any excess after paying taxes, costs, and all expenses of a sale, it shall be immediately paid to the person authorized to receive the excess. 
2.  In any event, within ninety (90) days from the date executions are placed in his hands, the marshal finds an execution to be either uncollectible or not collectable in full, he shall so notify the finance director in writing. It shall be the duty of the finance director to cause cancellation of executions on the general execution docket of the county upon their final payment or collection. 
H.  Garnishments by City; Reduction of Executions to Judgment. 
1.  Whenever the marshal can find no property belonging to a defendant in fi. fa. on which to levy any tax execution in his hands, he shall make an entry to that effect on the execution. The finance director, in the name of the City of Marietta, may then petition any court of competent jurisdiction to issue a summons of garnishment against any person whom he or she believes to be indebted to the defendant in fi. fa. or who has property, money, or effects in his hands belonging to the defendant in fi. fa. The finance director shall enter upon the execution the names of the persons garnished and the court and file number of the action where the garnishment is filed. All subsequent proceedings shall be the same as provided by law in other cases where judgments have been obtained or execution issued. 
2.  When an execution for taxes remains unsatisfied and an entry of "nulla bona" has been duly entered by the marshal on the execution within the immediately preceding thirty (30) day period and the finance director has reason to believe the defendant in fi. fa. may have or may come into ownership of assets outside the state, the finance director, in the name of the City of Marietta, may petition the superior court of the county in this state in which the defendant in fi. fa. maintains a known residence, place of business, or agent to receive service, to reduce the execution to judgment. If the defendant in fi. fa. does not maintain a known residence in this state, the action may be brought in the county where the tax obligation arose. This and all subsequent proceedings shall be brought in accordance with Chapter 3 of Title 48 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
I.  Redemption Rights of Defendant in fi. fa.; Vesting of Title in Grantee. 
1.  Whenever real property is sold for taxes or any special assessment, the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property may redeem the property from the sale by the payment of the redemption price or the amount required for redemption as fixed by O.C.G.A. Section 48-5-42, at any time within twelve (12) months from the date of sale, and at any time after the sale until the right to redeem is foreclosed by the giving of the notice provided for in O.C.G.A. Section 48-5-45, which code sections by reference are incorporated herein as a part of the code. 
2.  Where notice of foreclosure of the right to redeem real property sold at a tax sale has not been given as required in subsection (A) of this section, title shall ripen by prescription after a period of four years from the date of recording of the deed in the county where the property is situated, provided the defendant in fi. fa. was not laboring under any legal disability at the time of sale. Unless the tax deed indicates a lesser interest was levied upon and sold, a fee simple title to the property shall vest absolutely in the grantee in the deed or in the grantee's heirs or assigns. In the event the defendant in fi. fa. is laboring under any legal disability, the prescriptive term shall begin from the time the disabilities are removed or abated. 
J.  Costs. 
1.  For issuing executions, the city shall receive only an amount equal to any filing fees charged by the Clerk of Superior Court for recording and cancellations of the tax fi. fa. 
2.  Once a levy is made or posted on the property of a defendant in fi. fa., in addition to all taxes, interest, penalties and cost heretofore accrued, the marshal shall collect a levy administration fee of five percent of the taxes due or two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00), whichever is the lesser; however, no levy administration fee shall be less than fifty dollars ($50.00). 
3.  In addition to the levy administration fees, after levy but prior to the sale, the marshal shall collect his actual cost for advertising the sale, postage and service fees actually incurred, and any attorney's fees incurred in examination of title to property, plus a commission for conducting the sale, not to exceed eight percent on sums of fifty dollars ($50.00) or less, six percent on sums above fifty dollars ($50.00) up to five hundred fifty dollars ($550.00), and three percent on all sums exceeding five hundred fifty dollars ($550.00). 
4.  The costs provided in this section shall be cumulative and in addition to any statutory premiums allowed as a part of the redemption price.

The human resources director and the department head or their designees will develop a plan to either open the position competitively to the public and employees or to open the position promotionally to employees only. The request to fill the position must include class title, assigned pay grade, and current minimum job requirements. 
2.  The human resources director or designee shall review the information submitted by the department head or designee to ensure that information necessary for recruitment, selection, appointment or promotion is provided, and to ensure that suggested employment standards are consistent with equal employment opportunity laws and regulations. All requests must be approved by the human resources director and the city manager or BLW general manager or their designees. 
B.  Posting and Advertisement. 
1.  All vacancies should be announced on the city/BLW employee bulletin boards. If the position is also to be open to the public, the announcement will also be advertised publicly on the city/BLW website and telephonic job line message system and sent to a listing of appropriate organizations and individuals and such other organizations and websites on file in the human resources department that might attract potential candidates. Employees are encouraged to refer qualified applicants to the human resources department.

B.  Applications for positions with the city/BLW shall be made through the human resources department on application forms which require information covering training, experience, skills, and such other job related information as may be necessary to determine the abilities of the applicant to meet the requirements of the position or by resume for certain designated positions. 
C.  All applications and letters of interest must be signed by the applicant. If, at any time, the applicant's information is, in the sole discretion of the city/BLW determined to be materially false, the applicant or employee is subject to either elimination from further consideration or disciplinary action up to and including discharge. The human resources director or the department head may disqualify an applicant who practices or attempts to practice fraud or deception in the application or selection process. 
D.  The human resources director or applicable department head may require the applicant to submit proof of education, military service, necessary certifications or licenses or any other job related documentation deemed necessary. 
E.  Applicants are considered for advertised positions for which they specifically apply. Should the same or similar position become open in the same department within 30 days of the closing date of the first announcement, or longer at the discretion of the human resources director, the same applicant pool or group will be used without further announcement or advertisement. In order to utilize this applicant pool or group in this manner, the department hiring manager should create and send to the human resources department an eligibility list of other candidates deemed best qualified at the time the original vacancy is filled. 
F.  Applications may be updated to be considered for a new vacancy at the request of the applicant if the applicant can provide the title of the position that he previously applied for and the request for update is within three months of the previous application. 
G.  Individuals with passing scores on police and fire entrance examinations will be listed in ranking order by score on an eligibility list. These candidates are eligible for further selection processing for a minimum time period of six months to a maximum time period of two years. The duration of each list, within these parameters, will be at the discretion of the respective chief of each department after approval by the human resources director. 
H.  The police chief or fire chief may waive their respective police officer/firefighter entrance examination requirement as described above for eligible former employees. Eligibility at a minimum will include:

If the police or fire chiefs choose to waive the entrance examination for eligible former employees, they will advise the human resources director in writing of such candidates prior to the date of the scheduled entrance examination. 
The police and fire department may issue more restrictive eligibility requirements than the above listing. However, no such supplemental rule or policy will be effective without the approval of the city council. In the event of a conflict, the more restrictive rule will be enforced. 
Rehired former employees are to be treated as new employees in all other respects including but not limited to working test period, benefits, eligibility for promotion/special assignments and eligibility for performance-based pay raises.

4-4-6-030 - Selection process. 
A.  Screening Process, Human Resources Department. The human resources department staff will evaluate and screen each application for an advertised position for the purpose of determining whether the applicant meets the established employment standards. Applicants may be requested to furnish information or evidence as is necessary to make such a determination including, but not limited to written, oral, physical or performance tests or any combination of these as determined by the hiring department and the human resources department. Applicants best meeting employment standards will be referred to the employing department head or his designee for further review and personal interview. 
B.  Screening Process, Department Level. The department head or designee will review referred applications for skill needs and interview at least three of the referred candidates for each vacant position. The department head or his designee may request interviews with additional candidates. However, the department head or his designee may either select an employee from among applicants referred or choose not to select from the provided applicant pool and request that the position be readvertised. The department head shall inform the human resources director or designee of his recommendation for hire as soon as possible after he makes a decision. 
C.  Basis of Employment. Employment with the city/BLW shall be based on the ability to perform the essential job functions described for each position, with or without a reasonable accommodation, merit, and moral fitness as evidenced by: 
1.  Training, experience, education and skill level as reflected by the application form and other requested documentation; 
2.  Written examination or performance tests when applicable; 
3.  Drug screening examination for all jobs; 
4.  References and background investigations; 
5.  Minimum physical agility standards for non-civilian members of the police and fire departments; and 
6.  Post-offer medical examinations. 
D.  Examinations and Interviews. All applicants are subject to the requirements of the standard examinations and/or performance testing procedures which are currently in practice for the position for which they have applied. Written examinations used by the city/BLW will be validated for job relevancy based on legally acceptable validation methodologies. Interview questions used as a basis for making hiring decisions will be uniformly applied to each applicant for a position and will be job-related to determine the merit and fitness of the applicant for the particular position for which they have applied. However, no hiring authority is restricted from following up with additional related questions based on an applicant's response to any standard interview question or from deleting a standard question if the answer is obvious or well-known to the hiring authority. 
E.  References and Background Investigations. The human resources department, the department head or their designee may perform, depending on the nature of the job: reference checks, criminal history checks, credit history checks, education and other asserted credentials verification or other background investigations including polygraph testing and driving history checks as part of the preemployment procedure. 
F.  Post-Employment Offer Physical Examinations and Drug Screening. For certain designated positions, individuals who have received a conditional offer of employment or offer of promotion, transfer or demotion to such designated positions shall receive a physical and/or psychological examination that is job-related and is consistent with business necessity and/or drug screening test prior to their first day of employment or service in the new position. If a current employee who is seeking a promotion, transfer or demotion to a position in a different department fails the drug screen for the new position; the employee's current department head as well as the prospective department head will be notified of such failure. 
G.  Selection Decision. The authority for making the final decision as to which applicant will be hired rests with the department head. No offer of employment shall be made until a completed City of Marietta/BLW employment application is on file with the human resources department and the results of all preemployment tests, reference checks and background information are completed and analyzed. All appointments and conditions of employment will be reviewed and approved by the department head and the human resources director. 
H.  Establishment of Trainee Position. If, in the judgment of the department head and the human resources director, there appear to be no qualified candidates as a result of a recruitment effort, a position may be temporarily reclassified as a trainee position. The trainee position will be readvertised with lower qualification requirements and starting wage. If the trainee position becomes vacant or the occupant of the position fully meets the requirements of the original position, the trainee position reverts to the original, budgeted classification. 
I.  Establishment of Apprenticeship Programs. The city council may establish certain career apprenticeship programs, for example: apprentice electrical lineworker. The purpose of this type of program is to recruit and train individuals with little or no previous experience or training in order to provide an adequate stream of qualified individuals into a high skilled trade or profession. Any individual employed on or after July 1, 2007, in such apprenticeship program is designated as an "at-will" employee. Employment in such an apprenticeship program does not in any way grant, imply, or create a contract of employment for any specific period of time. A program designated as a formal apprenticeship program is a specific training program and success will depend on the ability of the participant to learn and apply specific skills. Employment may be terminated by the city/BLW or the employee for any or no reason whatsoever. However, in consideration of such training opportunity, if the apprentice employee terminates his/her employment, in order to leave the city/BLW's service in good standing, he/she must inform his/her department head of his/her resignation, in writing, at least 14 calendar days in advance of the date of resignation. Failure to comply with this procedure may be cause for denying such individual future employment with the city/BLW. Further, employees serving a formal apprenticeship program do not have the right to administrative appeal, grievance procedures or hearing rights except that such employees have the right to utilize the procedure outlined in Section 4-4-4-030 to file complaints of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex, disability and political affiliation in accordance with Article 4-4-4 herein. A post-employment name-clearing hearing for such apprentice workers may be conducted if deemed appropriate at the discretion of the city manager. 
J.  Reasonable Accommodation Policy. 
1.  It is the policy of the city/BLW to provide reasonable accommodation to the known physical and/or mental limitations of qualified applicants or employees with disabilities, when to do so does not result in undue hardship. The policy is implemented to: 
a.  Ensure equal opportunity in the application process; 
b.  Enable a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of a job; and 
c.  Enable a qualified employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment. 
2.  It is the obligation of an individual with a disability to request a reasonable accommodation unless the qualified employee has an obvious or otherwise known disability and it appears that he cannot perform an essential function of the job. 
3.  A qualified individual with a disability has the right to refuse a reasonable accommodation. However, after refusing a reasonable accommodation, if the individual cannot perform the essential functions of the job, he can be considered unqualified for the job. 
4.  The following process will be followed to identify the kind of accommodation best suited for the activity: 
a.  The activity or job will be examined to determine its purpose and essential functions. 
b.  The ADA coordinator in the human resources department will consult with the individual with the disability to determine their specific physical and/or mental abilities and limitations as they relate to the essential job functions. 
c.  The ADA coordinator in consultation with the individual and/or sources providing technical assistance for reasonable accommodations, will identify potential reasonable accommodations and assess how effective each would be in enabling the individual to perform essential job functions. 
K.  The chiefs of the fire and police departments shall establish bona fide occupational qualifications for non-civilian members of their departments in order to assure the initial and continued fitness and ability of such members to perform their duties. These qualifications shall include, but are not limited to, mental and physical qualifications. In addition, all individuals hired as police officers and firefighters after the date of approval of this ordinance are required, with or without a reasonable accommodation, to meet minimum physical agility standards, established by the city and as may be amended, in order to be initially employed and shall continue to meet these minimum physical agility standards throughout their career with the city. Failure to meet minimum physical agility standards will constitute a failure to meet minimum fitness for duty requirements and as such will be cause for separation from employment in accordance with Section 4-4-8-030. 
L.  When vacancies occur in non-civilian positions in the police and fire departments above entry level and below a deputy chief appointment, the chiefs of the fire and police departments shall have authority to select individuals to fill such vacancies in the following manner: 
1.  The chief will post or cause to be posted a notice on all employee bulletin boards within their respective departments soliciting applications for the promotional process from eligible candidates. 
2.  The selection process may include, but is not limited to: 
a.  A written examination; 
b.  An assessment center; 
c.  A review of the candidates' departmental employment history; 
d.  An evaluation of the candidates' promotional potential by all ranking officers and/or supervisors in the candidates' chain of command below the rank of chief; 
e.  A background investigation including, but not limited to, criminal history, credit history and driving history; 
f.  An alcohol and illegal drug screen; 
g.  For those employees hired after October 12, 1994, either successful completion of a physical agility test or successful completion of a physical agility test within the previous 12 months provided the employee is not participating in any physical agility remediation program at the time of application to participate in the promotional process; and 
h.  Oral interviews may, at the discretion of the chief, be conducted with the chief or his designee. Failure to successfully complete or pass any portion of the selection process as outlined herein will eliminate such employee from further consideration for the duration of the eligibility list. The specific selection instruments will be periodically reviewed and validated for job relevancy. All selection procedures will be uniformly applied to all eligible candidates to determine the merit and fitness of the candidate for the particular position for which they have applied. 
3.  The authority for making the final decision as to which candidate will be promoted rests with the chiefs of each department. No offer of promotion shall be made until the results of all of the selection procedures have been completed and analyzed. 
4.  Individuals who have successfully completed the selection process as described in subsection (K)(2) of this section will be listed in ranking order by total score on an eligibility list. These candidates are eligible for promotion for a minimum time period of one year to a maximum time period of three years. The duration of each list, within these parameters, will be at the discretion of the respective chief of each department.

A.  No relative of the mayor, any council member, the city manager, the BLW general manager, any BLW board member, any civil service board member, or any staff member of the human resources department shall be employed in any position with the city. In addition, relatives of city employees shall not be employed if such employment will result in one relative supervising another relative, or where one relative occupies a position which has an influence over the other relative's employment, promotion, salary administration, or other related management or personnel considerations.

C.  In the event of a marriage between two employees of the same department in which there is a supervisory influence or relationship, one employee is required to make arrangements for a transfer or submit his or her resignation within 30 calendar days of such event. If no prior arrangements are made with the human resources department, the employee hired last will forfeit their position. 
D.  Any person who is a relative of the mayor, city council member, BLW general manager, BLW board member, civil service board member, or the city manager, or a staff member of the human resources department who is employed by the city at the time such mayor, council member, BLW general manager, BLW board member, civil service board member, city manager or human resources department staff member is elected or appointed to office or hired may continue in his employment with the city/BLW. 
E.  The foregoing section shall not apply to employees of the city/BLW hired or who became related prior to February 13, 1985 (the effective date of adoption of the original relative limitation policy), but shall apply to all employees hired or who became related thereafter.

ARTICLE 4-4-11 - COMPUTER AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USAGE 

4-4-11-010 - Internet and electronic mail acceptable use policy. 
A.  General Principles. This statement sets forth the policy of the City of Marietta (city) and Marietta Board of Lights and Water (BLW) with regard to access to and disclosure of electronic mail (E-mail), instant messaging (IM), and other electronic records sent or received by employees, utilizing city/BLW-provided technology and Internet technology. 
Internet, instant messaging (IM), and E-mail services are provided by the city/BLW to support open communications and exchange of information and the opportunity for collaborative government-related work. The city/BLW encourages the use of electronic communications by its agencies and employees. Although access to information and information technology is essential to the missions of government agencies and their users, use of Internet, instant messaging (IM), and E-mail services is a revocable privilege. Conformance with acceptable use, as expressed in this policy statement is required. Departments of the city/BLW are expected to maintain and enforce this policy. 
Internet, instant messaging (IM), and E-mail communications to and from city/BLW employees are presumed to be work-related. City/BLW computers and any data stored in them are the property of the city/BLW, and may be accessed at any time by authorized officials of the city/BLW. Employees shall not expect privacy in the use of city/BLW computers. The city/BLW may, without notice, monitor Internet, instant messaging (IM), and/or E-mail to ensure it is being used only for business purposes. 
At a minimum, users of Internet, instant messaging (IM), and E-mail services provided by the city/BLW are expected to: 
1.  Inform themselves of this acceptable use policy and acceptable and unacceptable uses on the Internet, instant messaging (IM), and with E-mail used both internally to the city/BLW and externally to the world at large. The burden of responsibility is on the user to abide by the acceptable and unacceptable uses, or prior to use, inquire about uses not cited. Compliance with applicable acceptance use restrictions is mandatory. 
2.  Use city/BLW-provided Internet, instant messaging (IM), and E-mail services for city/BLW government-related activities and not for personal business. 
3.  Abide by the legal protection provided by copyright and license to programs and data. 
4.  Know and follow the generally accepted etiquette of the Internet. For example, use civil forms of communication when using E-mail, instant messaging (IM), and/or the Internet. 
5.  Avoid uses of the network E-mail, instant messaging (IM), blogging, and/or the Internet that reflect poorly on their department or on the city/BLW. Statements on E-mail, instant messaging (IM), and/or the Internet should reflect the same language used in the presence of a department head or the city manager. City/BLW Conflict of Interest Code and other existing and evolving rules, regulations, and guidelines on ethical behavior of government employees and the appropriate use of government resources apply to the use of electronic communications systems supplied by the city/BLW. 
6.  Make each electronic communication truthful and accurate.

This includes messaging software such as AOL, Yahoo, and MSN. Some games that help teach, illustrate, train, or simulate agency-related issues may be acceptable. 
7.  Use city/BLW-provided Internet, instant messaging (IM), and/or E-mail services so as to interfere with or disrupt network users, services, or equipment. 
8.  Intentionally seek out information on, obtain copies of, or modify files and other data, which are confidential under federal, state, or local law, unless specifically authorized to do so once the legal conditions for release are satisfied. 
9.  No intentional copy is to be made of any software, electronic file, program, music, or data using city/BLW-provided Internet, instant messaging (IM), and/or E-mail services without a prior, good faith determination that such copying is, in fact, permissible. Any efforts to obtain permission should be adequately documented. Copyrighted materials include text and pictures, video, and audio (to include music). 
10.  Intentionally seeking information on, obtaining copies of, or modifying files or data belonging to others without authorization of the file owner. Seeking passwords of others or the exchange of passwords is specifically prohibited.

City Code Section 44-20-040, Rule Z, requires disciplinary action for improper or inappropriate use of the city/BLW computer hardware or software or communications systems and, specifically, violations of this section of the Code of Ordinances. 
D.  Additional Guidelines. 
1.  Computer Viruses on Downloaded Software. Any software obtained from outside the city/BLW government shall be virus checked prior to use. 
2.  Use by Contractors. Contractors and other non-city/BLW employees may be granted access to city/BLW-provided Internet services at the discretion of the city manager. Acceptable use by contractors and other non-city/BLW employees working for the city/BLW is the responsibility of the city/BLW contract administrator. The city/BLW contract administrator is expected to provide contractors who use city/BLW Internet, instant messaging (IM), and/or E-mail services with this policy. 
3.  Passwords. Use passwords associated with a city/BLW information system only on that system. When setting up an account at a different information system that will be accessed using the Internet, choose a password that is different from ones used on city/BLW information systems. Do not use the same password for both local and remote Internet-accessed systems. If the password used at the remote, Internet-accessed remote site were to be compromised, the different password used locally would still be secure. Passwords should not be so obvious so that others could easily guess them, and passwords shall be changed at least every 60 days. 
4.  Logoff (Exiting). Always make a reasonable attempt to complete the logoff or other termination procedure when finished using a remote, Internet-accessed system or resource. This will help prevent potential breaches of security. 
5.  E-mail and Instant Messaging (IM) Security. Unencrypted electronic mail and instant messages (IM) sent or received outside any department and on the Internet cannot be expected to be secure. 
6.  Large File Transfers and Internet Capacity. The Internet connection is a shared resource. While routine E-mail, instant messaging (IM), and file transfer activities won't impact other users much, large file transfers and intensive multimedia activities will impact the service levels of other users. Users contemplating file transfers of over ten megabytes per transfer or interactive video activities shall, to be considerate of other users, schedule these activities early or late in the day or, better, after business hours. 
7.  Disclaimers. Users shall avoid being drawn into discussions where disclaimers like "this represents my personal opinion and not that of my department of the city/BLW" need to be used. When you are using Internet, instant messaging (IM), and or E-mail services provided by the city/BLW, users shall remember that they are representing the city/BLW and shall act accordingly. 
8.  Retention. Only essential E-mail and/or instant messages shall be saved. The IT department will delete E-mail transactions greater than 60 days old. It is the responsibility of the department head to establish retention criteria in compliance with federal and state law for essential E-mail and other electronic records within his/her department. 
9.  Open Records Act. All public departments are subject to the Open Records Act. All records, including computer-based or generated information fall under this Act. Therefore, users of the city/BLW information systems should treat computer-based information as they would written communications. All information on the city/BLW computer system is confidential. Such information may not be shared with other users internally or externally except through the procedures outlined in the Georgia Open Records Act. Department heads will be responsible for determining what information is appropriate for dissemination via E-mail, instant messaging, and other forms of electronic dissemination. 
10.  Permanence. Users shall exercise the same care in drafting E-mail and instant messages that would be applied to any other written communication. E-mail is more permanent than paper communications. Anything said in E-mail and instant messaging may be discovered by an opponent in litigation. 
11.  Enforcement. All provisions of this policy are deemed rules of the city/BLW and violation of any could result in disciplinary action up to and including termination under the City Code (Section 4-4-20-040). 
E.  Procedures. The department head, or their delegated representative is responsible for their employees' compliance with the provisions of this policy and for investigating noncompliance. When an instance of noncompliance with this policy is discovered or suspected, the agency shall proceed in accord with departmental and city/BLW personnel policies. Complaints about inappropriate or offensive E-mail, instant messaging, and/or other forms of electronic communication should be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor. Such reports shall be taken seriously by the supervisor and carefully investigated. Suspension of service to users may occur when deemed necessary to maintain the operation and integrity of the city/BLW network.

4-4-11-030 - Information security policy. 
A.  Purpose: This document is designed to provide the city/BLW minimum security policies for protection of city/BLW assets inclusive of information, computers and networks. 
B.  Information Custodianship: Information, such as data, electronic mail, documents and software, are city/BLW assets. By placing information on a city/BLW system, employees grant the city/BLW the right to edit, delete, copy, republish, and/or distribute such information. The city/BLW at all times retains the right to access, search, and monitor all directories, electronic mail messages, instant messages, voice mail messages, Internet sites visited by employees, chat groups and newsgroups, material downloaded or uploaded by users of the Internet, or any other electronic or telephonic transmissions contained in or used in conjunction with the city/BLW's computer, electronic mail, instant messaging, and voice systems and equipment with no prior notice. This right applies both during employees' employment by the city/BLW and after its cessation for any reason or no reason, including whether the cessation was voluntary or involuntary. In determining the value of an asset, consideration shall be given not only to the sensitivity of the information, but also to the consequences of unauthorized disclosure, modification, destruction, or unavailability of the information. The value of these assets will determine the level of controls needed to provide adequate safeguards, backup and access controls. However, ownership, custodial responsibility and rights to these assets are herein established. 
1.  Records. A "record" includes any information kept, held, filed, produced or reproduced by, with or for a department in any form or media including, but not limited to, reports, statements, examinations, memoranda, opinions, folders, files, books, manuals, pamphlets, forms, papers, designs, drawings, maps, images, photos, letters, microfilms, computer tapes or discs, rules, regulations or codes. 
2.  Property of a Department. All records, software, and hardware that are part of a department's information system are considered property of the city/BLW and shall be used for city/BLW business purposes only. 
3.  Designation of Responsibility. Department heads, or their designee, have the responsibility to ensure that all city/BLW information resources, regardless of medium, are used, maintained, disclosed and disposed of according to law, regulation or policy. 
4.  Copyright and Licensing of Vendor Hardware and Software. Departments shall adhere to copyright laws and licensing agreements. 
5.  Records Retention and Destruction. City/BLW information shall be retained and/or destroyed in accordance with records retention schedules developed in cooperation with the State Archives and Records Administration (SARA) and policies and procedures established by the city/BLW, unless required otherwise by applicable laws. 
6.  State and Federal Access, Privacy and Confidentiality Laws. All information, regardless of the medium in which it is maintained or communicated, is subject to pertinent state and federal laws governing access, the protection of privacy and prohibitions against unauthorized disclosure. 
7.  Access Categories—Classification of Information. Information classification provides a means for separating information into categories with different protective requirements. The city/BLW determines, in advance, the extent to which information shall be disclosed to specified users. Determinations shall be made based on the nature of the information and the duties of city/BLW employees. The following general categories of information serve to provide guidance in identifying appropriate users or recipients: 
a.  "Public information" is information accessible under Freedom of Information Law and the Georgia Open Records Act and is available to any person, notwithstanding one's status or interest within the limitations as provided in those laws. 
b.  "Restricted information" pertains to information that is not public information, but can be disclosed to or used by city/BLW representatives to carry out their duties, so long as there is no legal bar to disclosure. 
c.  "Confidential information" including protected health information (PHI) is information that is protected by law. Access to confidential information is prohibited unless permitted by an exception in law. 
C.  Physical Access Security: The department head shall put into place appropriate safeguards to limit physical access to any radio, computer, or computer-related device. 
1.  Secure Locations. Mainframe, servers and other essential computer devices shall be stored in a location that protects them from unauthorized physical access. Physical access to such equipment potentially provides access to information stored therein. 
2.  Location Selection. Physical locations for all computer-related equipment shall be selected to protect against equipment and information loss by flood, fire, and other disasters, natural or manmade. 
3.  Review of New Connections to Outside Sources. Proposed access to or from a network external to the city/BLW shall be reviewed and approved by the department head or designee prior to establishment of the connection. Final approval shall be obtained from the director of IT. 
4.  Review of Installation. Installation, upgrades, changes and/or repairs of radios, computer equipment, or computer-related devices (hardware, software, firmware) are to be reviewed by the IT department for potential physical security risks. 
5.  Platform-Specific Physical Security. Platform-specific physical security shall be established, implemented and periodically reviewed and revised as necessary to address physical vulnerabilities of that platform. 
6.  City/BLW Laptop, Notebook, PDA, Cell Phone, and Portable Computer Devices. Portable computing devices shall not be left unattended at any time unless the device has been secured. When traveling, portable computers and PDAs shall remain with the employee's carry-on hand luggage. 
D.  Information Security: The security officer (IT director or designee) is responsible for the security of all electronic information resources. Specific procedures will be developed and disseminated by the security officer to conform to the following policies. These procedures will be reviewed frequently to reflect changes in personnel and technology. 
E.  Information Security Administration Functions: The security officer will formally delegate responsibility for information security matters. Multiple individuals across organizational lines may be involved as long as there is a clear separation of duties and responsibilities which provide effective checks, balances and accountability. 
F.  Logon Security: Access to computer systems requires identification and authentication. Any exceptions to this rule require approval of the security officer or designee. 
G.  Remote Access to City/BLW Information: Remote external access to a city/BLW network, which contains restricted or confidential information, requires extended authentication procedures. Any method for providing this remote access (e.g., modem, firewall) requires Security Officer or designee approval prior to its installation. 
H.  External Network Access to City/BLW Information: External network access to a city/BLW network that contains restricted or confidential information including PHI requires at least a firewall. Firewalls provide network security similar to the installation of a perimeter security system on a building by blocking or permitting traffic. 
I.  Transaction Controls and Database Security: Transactions entered into the city/BLW production databases shall be checked for accuracy and authenticity. Database management systems (DBMS) shall implement security and authorization subsystems adequate to protect against unauthorized access and modification. 
J.  Downloading Software: The security officer, upon request of a department head, will determine whether downloading of software from an external site will be permitted. 
K.  City/BLW Owned IT Components: City/BLW hardware shall be reviewed and cleansed (sanitized) before being reassigned or discarded. The security officer shall work with IT department staff to ensure compliance with this policy. Department heads shall maintain adequate documentation of hardware/software taken off city/BLW premises by employees. 
L.  Electronic Communications: When transmitting confidential information, such as protected health information (PHI), on an external network (outside the firewall), city/BLW shall employ a secure technology rendering the information unusable to an unauthorized or intercepting third party. 
M.  Virus Protection: All city/BLW computers shall be equipped with up-to-date virus protection software. The IT department will ensure that all network attached PCs are virus protected. 
N.  City/BLW Security Management: Accountability and appropriate separation of duties and responsibilities are essential elements of security administration. Departments shall develop security awareness among all staff. 
1.  Security Training. All employees, agents and others who access city/BLW computer systems shall be provided with sufficient training and/or supporting reference materials to allow them to properly protect city/BLW information. 
2.  Employment Changes. Department heads or their designees shall report changes in employment status of their staff to the security officer and/or systems administrator in the IT department. 
3.  Audit Trails. The department head shall maintain audit trail records of individuals accessing city/BLW records sufficient to meet the requirements of the law, the city/BLW internal controls and audit requirements, and as necessary, disaster recovery requirements. 
O.  Information Recovery: All business applications shall have backup and recovery procedures that are documented, maintained and the backup media stored off site. The city/BLW shall test these procedures on an annual basis. 
P.  Data Exchange Agreements; Third Party Agreements: All agreements with third parties such as vendors, other government agencies, or contractors shall include requirements to adhere to city/BLW information security policies. 
Q.  Vendor/Contractor Agreements: All vendor agreements shall contain a requirement that any city/BLW information obtained as a result of such an agreement shall be the property of the city/BLW and shall not be utilized, including but not limited to, secondary release or disclosure, without written authorization of the city/BLW. 
R.  Employee/Agent Responsibilities: As a condition of continued employment, all employees/agents by signature of the city/BLW's Personnel Policies and Procedures, as may be amended, indicate that they have read and understand the city/BLW's policies and procedures regarding information security, and agree to comply in all respects to those policies and procedures. 
1.  Password Protection. Employees/agents shall not post or share their personal passwords, and shall develop secure passwords according to IT department security guidelines. 
2.  Use of Automatic Logons. Employees/agents shall not facilitate any logon procedure with local programming such as keyboard programming or scripting. 
3.  Unattended Computers. Unattended computers shall be logged off or protected in such a way as to protect the computer and network from unauthorized access. 
S.  Reporting Suspicious Events: Any observations of suspicious activity shall be reported to the appropriate department head and/or the information security officer. Suspicious activity can include: signs of unauthorized equipment usage during evenings and weekends, phone requests from unidentifiable callers for access to PHI, unidentifiable files found on file servers, and unusual activity recorded in log files.

ARTICLE 4-4-12 - OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT 

4-4-12-010 - Limitations and approval requirement. 
A.  City employment shall be considered to be the primary employment of all full-time employees. No employee may engage in outside employment which will interfere with the interests of city service. Standards by which some employment is not acceptable include, but is not limited to:

B.  Prior to beginning any regularly scheduled outside employment, employees will obtain specific written approval from their department head or his designee on request forms which indicate the name of the outside employer, the nature of the work, hours of work, address and telephone number where the employee can be reached. Such information will become a part of the employee's official personnel record. Employees are required to obtain approval from their department head or his designee for any change in a previously approved outside employment request.

D.  Employees sustaining injuries while engaged in outside employment are normally ineligible to receive benefits under the city's worker's compensation program. If an employee sustains an injury while engaged in outside employment, but is performing duties within the scope of his city responsibilities (i.e., a police arrest), he may be eligible for partial city worker's compensation benefits. 
E.  Failure to comply with the provisions of this section will result in disciplinary action.

ARTICLE 4-4-14 - UNIFORMS, APPEARANCE AND ISSUED EQUIPMENT POLICY 

4-4-14-010 - General appearance.

4-4-14-020 - Uniforms. 
A.  As the nature of the city's work varies greatly, it is recognized that what is appropriate for employees in one department may not be appropriate for another. Work clothes and/or uniforms provided for some departments generally set the standard for their functions. Determination of any employee's specific dress and appearance is a supervisory responsibility and will be treated as such; but any such dress or appearance standards prescribed by any department must be relevant to the work to be accomplished. 
B.  All uniforms issued, including all required equipment such as clothing, hats, gloves, safety shoes/boots, etc. shall be worn on duty unless excused in writing by a licensed physician and approved in writing by the department head. Such excuse may be verified by an individual or entity appointed by the city/BLW. Such excuse shall be presented to the employee's supervisor. Nevertheless, employees will still be required to perform the essential functions of their position with or without a reasonable accommodation. If the wearing of safety equipment and/or the uniform are essential functions of the position, and the employee cannot, by physician's statement, wear the equipment and/or uniform, then the employee will be separated from employment. See Section 4-4-8-040. No part of the uniform or equipment issued by the city/BLW shall be utilized in any manner while off duty unless permission is granted by the appropriate department head. It is the employee's responsibility to maintain and protect issued uniforms and equipment. 
C.  All uniforms and any issued equipment, tools, keys, etc., will be returned to the city/BLW upon separation from employment.

Incomplete or partial completion of the base period voids this benefit. The base period shall include no part of the initial six months of employment. 
I.  Exhausted Sick Leave. No sick leave in excess of that accumulated may be granted. For an extended illness, an employee may elect to use his vacation leave or, if applicable, accrued compensatory time. If all accrued sick, vacation and compensatory time is used, the employee may be granted a leave of absence without pay as provided under Section 4-4-16-090 of these policies and procedures or released from employment. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1095; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 6547, 8/13/2003, § 1; Ord. No. 6704, 8/11/2004, § 1; Ord. No. 7028, 4/11/2007, §§ 5, 6; Ord. No. 7393, 10/14/2009, § 1) 
4-4-16-060 - Military leave. 
These provisions are intended to comply with federal and state laws regarding military leave and are not intended to add to or detract from those regulations. See the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA), 38 U.S.C. Section 4301 et seq., commonly known as the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2004, the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2008, O.C.G.A. § 38-2-54, and O.C.G.A. § 38-2-279. The city/BLW specifically reserves the right to add to, change, or abolish the provisions of this section, in whole or in part, based upon pertinent action by any appropriate legislative, judicial or regulatory authority. 
In accordance with these laws, the city/BLW will not discriminate against any employee or job applicant in initial employment, reemployment, retention, promotion, or any benefit of employment on the basis of their membership, application for membership, performance of military service, application for service, or obligation to the uniformed service. 
A.  Eligibility. Any regular employee who is a member of a uniformed service, or any current employee who is drafted or joins a uniformed service may be granted a leave of absence for the purpose of service, including travel to and from same. Such service may be voluntary or involuntary, in time of peace or war. The "uniformed services" are defined as the U.S. Army or U.S. Army Reserve, U.S. Navy or U.S. Navy Reserve, U.S. Air Force or U.S. Air Force Reserve, U.S. Marines or U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, U.S. Coast Guard or U.S. Coast Guard Reserve, National Guard, Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service, State Defense Force, or the National Disaster Medical System. 
B.  Advance Notice. An employee, or an appropriate officer of the uniformed service in which his service is to be performed, must notify the city/BLW that the employee intends to leave his position to perform uniformed service. An "appropriate officer" is a commissioned, warrant, or noncommissioned officer authorized to give such notice by the uniformed service concerned. Although verbal notice is acceptable, employees should make every effort to provide written notice at least 30 days prior to departure. No advance notice is required if the notice is precluded by military necessity or the giving of notice is impossible or unreasonable. 
C.  Health Benefits. All full-time employees on military leave are entitled to continue their health insurance under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) for up to 24 months. The city/BLW can charge the employee 102 percent of the full premium for this coverage if the military leave exceeds 31 calendar days. If the leave is 31 calendar days or less, the employee can continue to pay the employee portion of the premium and the city/BLW will continue to pay the employer portion until the end of the 31st calendar day. 
Employees who do not elect to continue coverage during military leave will have their coverage reinstated upon reemployment without any exclusions or waiting periods except to the extent the exclusion would have applied even if coverage had not been terminated as a result of such service. However, some exclusions or waiting periods could apply to medical problems or conditions that the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs determines to be the result of a service-connected disability. 
D.  Pension Benefits. 
1.  Supplemental Pension. The city/BLW will retroactively contribute to the account of returning employees, an amount that would have been contributed had the employee not left for military duty. Allocations will not include earnings or forfeitures. 
2.  Regular Pension. Time spent in the uniformed service will be credited to all employees toward meeting length of service requirements for eligibility for participating in a retirement plan, for vesting in the retirement plan or in the calculation of benefits under the retirement plan. The city/BLW will suspend pension contributions during uniformed service because the employee is not in pay status. However, upon such employee's return, the city/BLW will retroactively contribute an amount that would have been contributed had the employee not left for duty. Earnings for pension purposes will be computed at the hourly or salary rate at which it would have been earned if the employee were not on leave. The break in service provision of the retirement plans shall not affect an employee on military leave. 
E.  Reemployment. Employees on a leave of absence for uniformed service or training have varying time limits within which to report to work or apply for reemployment after service has ended, depending on the length of the period of service or training. For service of 30 days or less, employees must notify the city/BLW verbally or in writing of their intent to return to a position of employment no later than the first regularly scheduled work period on the first full calendar day after the service plus eight hours to return home. For service from 31 to 180 days, an application for reemployment must be filed within 14 days after completion of the service. For service for 181 days or more, an application for reemployment must be submitted not later than 90 days after completion of the service. All of these deadlines can be extended for up to two years if the individual is hospitalized or convalescing from a service-connected injury or illness. Such discharge from service must not be disqualifying and the employee must be physically and mentally capable of performing the essential functions of the work involved in his previous or similar position with or without a reasonable accommodation. An examination by an individual or entity appointed by the city BLW at city/BLW expense will be utilized to aid in determining fitness for duty and/or the ability to perform the essential functions of the position with or without a reasonable accommodation. An "application for reemployment" is defined as an employee notifying the department of human resources verbally or in writing that he or she is returning from duty and seeks reemployment. For any period of service that exceeds 30 days, employees must also submit acceptable documentation that establishes a timely reemployment application, shows that the employee has not exceeded the five-year total time limit on the duration of service, and shows that the employee's separation or discharge from service was not disqualifying. Examples of acceptable documentation include the Department of Defense Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty), military orders carrying an endorsement indicating completion of required service, or copies of payroll documents showing periods of service. 
The city/BLW is not required to reinstate returning employees under the following conditions: 
1.  The city/BLW's circumstances have so changed as to make reemployment impossible or unreasonable; 
2.  The employment from which the person leaves to serve in the uniformed services is for a brief, nonrecurring period and there is no reasonable expectation that such employment will continue indefinitely or for a significant period; 
3.  The returning employee is no longer qualified (i.e., no longer has the ability to perform the essential functions of the position) despite the city/BLW's reasonable efforts to requalify such individual (including retraining) and reemployment would cause the city/BLW undue hardship; 
4.  The returning employee was not released from service under honorable conditions (see 38 U.S.C. Section 4304). Note: Reemployment rights are restored upon upgrade of discharge to service under honorable conditions. 
F.  Reemployment Rights. All regular employees on military leave will retain a right to reemployment for up to five years of cumulative service, with exceptions listed in 38 U.S.C. Section 4312. 
1.  An employee who is called to active service for less than 90 days is entitled to: 
a.  Reemployment in the position in which the employee would have been employed if the continuous employment of such person with the city/BLW had not been interrupted by such service, the duties of which the person is qualified to perform; or 
b.  Reemployment in the position in which the employee was employed on the date of the commencement of the service in the uniformed services, but only if the employee is not qualified to perform the duties of the position referred to above after reasonable efforts by the city/BLW to qualify the employee. 
2.  An employee who is called to active service for more than 90 days is entitled to: 
a.  Reemployment in the position of employment in which the person would have been employed if the continuous employment of such person with the city/BLW had not been interrupted by such service, or a position of like seniority, status or pay, the duties of which the person is qualified to perform; or 
b.  Reemployment in the position in which the person was employed on the date of the commencement of the service in the uniformed services, or a position of like seniority, status, and pay, the duties of which the person is qualified to perform, only if the person is not qualified to perform the duties of a position referred to above after reasonable efforts by the city/BLW to qualify the person. 
3.  In the case of a person who has a disability incurred in, or aggravated during such service, and who, after reasonable efforts by the city/BLW to accommodate the disability, is not qualified due to such disability to be employed in the position of employment in which the person would have been employed, the employee is entitled to: 
a.  Reemployment in any other position which is equivalent in seniority, status and pay, the duties of which the employee is qualified to perform or would become qualified to perform with reasonable efforts by the city/BLW; or 
b.  Reemployment in a position which is the nearest approximation to a position referred to above in terms of seniority, status and pay consistent with circumstances of such person's case. 
4.  The employee will not be penalized for having been on duty and shall be entitled to the seniority and other rights and benefits determined by seniority that the employee had on the date of the commencement of service in the uniformed services plus the additional seniority and rights and benefits that such person would have attained if the person had remained continuously employed. The returning employee shall also be entitled to any increase in base salary accorded his position, excluding performance increases, which would normally be accorded to the incumbent in the position. 
5.  Reemployment will not be dependent upon the laying off of another person who was hired at an earlier date than the date of the person returning from military leave in the same or similar position. 
6.  The city/BLW will make reasonable efforts to refresh or update the skills of the returning employees from military leave by providing refresher training and any training the employee would have received if he or she would have remained on the job. 
G.  Paid Leaves of Absence. 
1.  All employees are entitled to leave of absence without loss of pay, leave benefits, or service time on all days which they are engaged in ordered military duty up to a maximum of 18 working days in any one federal fiscal year (October 1—September 30). A shift of 12 hours or less constitutes one workday for the purposes of this policy. For fire personnel who work a 24-hour shift, a maximum of nine shifts or 216 hours will be allowable for paid military leave during any one federal fiscal year. In the event the governor declares an emergency and orders any employee to ordered military duty as a member of the National Guard, any such employee, while performing such duty, shall be paid his salary or other compensation as an employee for a period not exceeding 30 days in any one federal fiscal year (October 1—September 30). 
2.  Leaves of absence exceeding 18 working days (or 216 hours for fire personnel) in any one federal fiscal year shall be granted for assignment to duty functions of a military character, without pay, but not less in service time. For National Guard members who are ordered by the governor to perform military duty for a declared emergency, leaves of absence exceeding 30 working days (or 360 hours for fire personnel) in any one federal fiscal year shall be granted, without pay, but not less in service time. 
3.  Employees will be paid the difference between their city salary and their military basic pay for any or all periods of absence while engaged in the performance of ordered military duty after expiration of the payment periods provided for in paragraphs 1. and 2. Employees must submit proof of military pay to the director of human resources and risk management to justify payment. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1096; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 6787, 3/9/2005, §§ 1—3; Ord. No. 7844, 10/14/2015, § 1; Ord. No. 7891, 6/8/2016, § 1) 
4-4-16-070 - Court leave. 
A.  An employee called for jury duty or subpoenaed as a witness, except on cases in which the witness is a plaintiff, cross-complainant or counter complainant, shall be granted court leave and shall be excused from work upon presentation of a court notice to the department head to that effect. Employees called to court for the purposes of this policy shall promptly notify their immediate supervisor so that arrangements can be made for their absence from work. The employee will be paid his regular pay provided he submits evidence of the actual days spent in court. Monies received or which could be received for said service from any court (except actual receipted expense) shall be endorsed to the city/BLW. Only the number of actual days or hours spent in court will be considered in granting leave and the employee must return to duty promptly when released by the court. 
B.  Employees who become plaintiffs or defendants are not eligible for court leave with pay. 
(Code 1978, Sec. 4-1097; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96) 
4-4-16-080 - Funeral leave. 
A.  All full-time, regular employees may be granted upon approval of the department head or their designee, time off with pay not to exceed three consecutive workdays or 36 hours for 24-hour shift fire personnel in the event of a death in their family. Two additional workdays or 20 hours for 24-hour fire personnel may be granted at the discretion of the department head. 
B.  The maximum allowed funeral leave in one calendar year is five workdays or 56 hours for 24-hour shift fire personnel. Such time is not chargeable to vacation or sick leave. 
C.  The employee may be required to provide the department head with proof of death in the family before compensation is approved. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1098; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7133, 2/13/2008, § 1) 
4-4-16-085 - Maternity leave.

C.  Maternity leave provided in this section shall run concurrently with Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave as provided in Section 4-4-16-090. 
(Ord. No. 7892, 6/8/2016, § 1) 
4-4-16-090 - Family and medical leave of absence without pay. 
The provisions of this section are regulated by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-3) and pertinent Department of Labor regulations as they may be promulgated. The city/BLW specifically reserves the right to add to, change or abolish the provisions of this section, in whole or in part, based upon pertinent action by any appropriate legislative, judicial or regulatory authority. 
A.  Eligibility and Reasons Granted. The provisions of this section apply only to those employees who have been employed for at least 12 months (such 12 months of employment does not have to be consecutive) and who have provided at least 1,250 hours of service during the 12 months before any leave is requested. In determining the hours worked, paid leave, such as vacation, sick or compensatory leave is not included. 
The city manager or a department head will grant up to a total of 12 workweeks of Family and Medical Leave Act (hereinafter FMLA) leave to any eligible employee during any 12-month period for one or more of the reasons listed below. The 12-month period for purposes of this section shall be measured forward from the beginning date of an employee's first approved FMLA leave. Employees are required to first use any accrued vacation, sick, holiday or compensatory leave for all or any part of this 12-week period. When an employee uses paid leave in lieu of unpaid FMLA leave, the city/BLW will only provide sufficient unpaid leave to total 12 workweeks in the designated 12-month period of time in accordance with FMLA regulations. 
1.  Reasons. 
a.  Birth of a child and to care for that child if requested within one year after birth of the child. Employees are required to give at least 30 days notice for a request for this reason and specify the amount of time requested. If, due to unforeseeable circumstances, some adjustment must be made to the requested leave, employees are required to provide the city/BLW with reasonable notice of such adjustment. Failure to comply with this notice requirement may be grounds for postponement of the requested leave. 
b.  Placement for adoption or foster care of a child if requested within one year after placement of the child. Employees are required to give at least 30 days notice for a request for this reason and specify the amount of time requested. If, due to unforeseeable circumstances, notice is not able to be given within the 30-day time period, employees are required to provide reasonable notice within two business days of learning of the need for leave. Failure to comply with this notice requirement may be grounds for postponement of the requested leave. 
c.  Serious personal health condition making the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his job. Employees are required to give notice as soon as practicable after the need for FMLA leave becomes known to the employee, and specify the amount of time requested. 
d.  Care for a parent, spouse, or child with a serious health condition. A qualifying child must be under 18 years of age, or if older, incapable of self care because of a mental or physical disability. Employees are required to give notice as soon as practicable after the need for FMLA leave becomes known to the employee, and specify the amount of time requested. For purposes of this policy, a parent includes only a biological parent or an individual who stands or stood in loco parentis to the employee when the employee was a child. Parents-in-law are not included. For purposes of this policy, child includes biological children, adopted children, foster children, step children, legal wards or a child of an employee standing in loco parentis and the child is either under age 18 or age 18 or older and incapable of self care because of a mental or physical disability. For purposes of this policy, spouse means a husband or wife as defined or recognized under state law for purposes of marriage in the state where the employee resides, including common law marriage in states where it is recognized. Domestic partners are not eligible for the provisions of this section. Leave for care of any other relatives or for any other individuals who may be a part of an employee's household is not authorized by this section. 
e.  Military Family Leave: The National Authorization Act for FY 2008 amended the FMLA to provide eligible employees working for the city/BLW additional leave rights related to military service. 
(1)  Eligible employees are entitles to up to 12 weeks of leave because of "any qualifying exigency" arising out of the fact that the spouse, son, daughter, or parent of the employee is on active duty, or has been notified of an impending call to active duty status, in support of contingency operation. 
(2)  An eligible employee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of a covered service member who is recovering from a serious illness or injury sustained in the line of duty on active duty is entitled to up to 26 weeks of leave in a single 12-month period to care for the service member. The military caregiver leave is available during "a single 12-month period" during which an eligible employee is entitled to combined total of 26 weeks of all types of FMLA leave. 
2.  For the purposes of this section, a serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition that involves one of the following: 
a.  Hospital Care. Inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility, including any period of incapacity or subsequent treatment in connection with, or as a consequence of, such inpatient care. Incapacity for the purposes of FMLA is defined to mean inability to work, attend schools, or perform other regular daily activities due to the serious health condition, treatment for it, or recovery from it. 
b.  Absence Plus Treatment. A period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days (including any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition) that also involves: 
(1)  Treatment two or more times by a health care provider, a nurse, or physician's assistant under direct supervision of a health care provider or by a provider of health care services (e.g., physical therapist) under orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider; or 
(2)  Treatment by a health care provider on at least one occasion that results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care provider. 
c.  Due to Pregnancy, or for Prenatal Care. Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal care. 
d.  Chronic Conditions Requiring Treatments. A chronic condition that: 
(1)  Requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care provider or a nurse or physician's assistant under the direct supervision of a health care provider; 
(2)  Continues over an extended period of time (including recurring episodes of a single underlying condition); and 
(3)  May cause episodic incapacity rather than a continuing period of incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.) 
e.  Permanent/Long-Term Conditions Requiring Supervision. A period of incapacity that is permanent or long term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective. The employee or family member must be under the continuing supervision of but need not be receiving active treatment from a health care provider. Examples include Alzheimer's, a severe stroke, or the terminal stages of a disease. 
f.  Multiple Treatments (Non-chronic Conditions). Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments (including any period of recovery from them) by a health care provider or a provider of health care services under orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider, either for restorative surgery after an accident or other injury or for a condition that would be likely to result in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days in the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as cancer, chemotherapy, radiation, etc., severe arthritis (physical therapy) or kidney disease (dialysis). 
Employees must give 30 days notice for all requests for leaves of absence for any planned medical treatment. If the employee fails to give 30 days notice, when requested, for foreseeable leave, with no reasonable excuse for the delay, the city manager or department head may deny the taking of FMLA leave until at least 30 days after the date the employee provides notice to the city manager or department head of the need for FMLA leave. 
All requests for FMLA leave for the serious medical condition of the employee, spouse, parent or child must be substantiated by a health care provider's certification of the existence of such medical condition. The initial certification must be provided within 15 days after the city/BLW requests such certification. The city/BLW'S request for certification shall be written and addressed to the employee. 
The employee is required to provide his department head on the beginning day of the sixth and twelfth week of FMLA leave, a recertification by the health care provider of the status of the employee's, spouse's, parent's or child's serious medical condition, and a written statement by the employee as to his intention to return to work. If the employee's FMLA leave is intermittent or a reduced schedule of work, the employee shall provide the required recertification and written statement of intent at such time as the employee's accumulated FMLA leave totals six weeks and 12 weeks. 
Intermittent leave or a reduced schedule of work may be taken whenever medically necessary to care for a seriously ill family member or because the employee is seriously ill and unable to work. Employees needing intermittent leave or leave on a reduced schedule must attempt to schedule their leave so as not to disrupt the department's operations. Intermittent leave or a reduced work schedule will not be approved for birth of a child, placement for adoption or foster care of a child. The city/BLW reserves the right to temporarily transfer an employee on intermittent leave or a reduced schedule of work to an alternative position, with equivalent pay and benefits, that better accommodates the recurring periods of leave than the employee's regular position. 
3.  If a husband and wife are employed by the city/BLW, they are limited to a combined total of 12 work weeks of FMLA leave during any 12-month period for the following reasons only: 
a.  Birth of a child, and to care for the newborn child; or 
b.  Placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care. 
B.  Employee Benefits During Leave. 
1.  Health Insurance. The city/BLW will provide and pay for the same group health care coverage during the FMLA leave in the same manner as for active employees. The city/BLW will notify the employee on FMLA to pay the employee portion of any health insurance premium owed to the city/BLW during his absence. If the employee elects not to return to work after the FMLA leave, the city/BLW will initiate proceedings to collect the city/BLW's portion of the premium paid during the leave of absence. The city/BLW will not collect such premiums if the employee fails to return to work after the FMLA leave due to a continuation, recurrence or onset of the medical condition or other circumstances affecting the employee or other family members which are clearly beyond the employee's control. 
2.  Life Insurance. The employee may elect to continue coverage of the city/BLW's life insurance benefit. The employee is responsible for timely payment of all premiums, including the city/BLW's portion, during his absence. The employee is responsible for timely payment of all premiums for any supplemental policies the employee wishes to continue. Failure to pay the monthly premiums within 30 days of the due date will result in termination of the coverage. 
3.  Vacation and Sick Leave. No vacation or sick leave will be earned by an employee on leave of absence without pay status. 
4.  Pension Plans. No contributions will be made to the employee's supplemental pension fund while on leave without pay status. However, credit for service time for the employee's regular pension plan will be credited to an employee while on leave without pay status for family and medical leave purposes only. 
5.  Performance Evaluations, Performance Awards and Longevity Bonuses. Any leave of absence without pay for four or more work weeks will result in a corresponding adjustment of evaluation date and, if eligible, the effective date of award of any eligible performance raise or bonus or longevity bonus will also be adjusted. 
C.  Return to Work. An employee is expected to return to work no later than the first work day of the week following the expiration of the FMLA leave for the above reasons. Failure to do so for any reason will constitute abandonment of city/BLW employment by the employee. 
Upon return from FMLA leave, an employee will be restored to his original job, or to an equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms and conditions. 
If the employee's absence is due to personal illness, the employee may return to work at any time upon providing a fitness for duty certification by his health care provider. Employees who desire to return to work prior to the end of their leave must give the city/BLW notice as soon as possible, but no later than two work days prior to their return. 
If an employee who requests leave under this section is identified as a key employee (a salaried employee who is compensated among the highest ten percent of all city/BLW employees at the time of the request) when he requests such leave, then such employee may be denied restoration to his employment with the city/BLW under the following conditions: 
1.  The restoration of the employee to employment will cause substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the city/BLW; 
2.  The city manager or department head gives written notice to the employee of his status as a "key" employee in response to the employee's notice of intent to take FMLA leave, and informs the employee of the potential consequences with respect to reinstatement and maintenance of health benefits if the city/BLW determines that substantial and grievous economic injury to the city/BLW's operations will result if the employee is reinstated from FMLA leave; 
3.  The city manager or department head gives the employee written notice as soon as a decision is made to deny job restoration and explains the reasons for the decision; 
4.  The city manager or department head offers the employee a reasonable opportunity to return to work from FMLA leave after giving notice; and 
5.  The city manager or department head makes a final determination as to whether reinstatement will be denied at the end of the FMLA leave period if the employee then requests restoration. 
D.  Procedure. 
1.  Employee's Responsibilities. The employee requesting family/medical leave should complete a request form as provided by the human resources department. Such request form should be submitted to the employee's department head and forwarded to the human resources department. The employee should meet with a human resources department staff member to explain the circumstances of the leave and for the personnel staff member to explain the employee's rights and obligations under this Act. The employee is also responsible for providing all information required on the form, notice of absence when required and for all certifications by any treating health care provider. An employee must work cooperatively with supervisors and department managers to work out a treatment schedule which best suits the needs of both the city/BLW and the employee. 
2.  Department Responsibilities. The department head is required to approve leave as outlined in this section for eligible employees. Department heads or supervisors are prohibited from discriminating against employees who take family and medical leave in employment decisions such as performance evaluations, promotions or disciplinary actions. Department and division managers are required to maintain the departmental and/or division poster notifying employees of the provisions of the FMLA. If an employee verbally notifies a supervisor, division manager or department head of the need for leave which may be eligible under this policy, such supervisor should inquire further of the employee of the need to have more information about whether FMLA leave is being sought by the employee, and to obtain the necessary details of the leave to be taken. 
3.  Human Resources Department. The human resources department will serve as advisor to employees and supervisors on the requirements of eligibility for family/medical leave and the provisions of the FMLA. All records pertaining to family and medical leave will be maintained in the employee's confidential medical file in the custody of the human resources department. The human resources department will be responsible for notification of any premiums due from the employee and the collection of same. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1099; Ord. No. 5198, 8/11/93; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7028, 4/11/2007, § 7; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, §§ 1, 7; Ord. No. 7545, 7/13/2011, § 3) 
4-4-16-100 - Leave of absence for religious holidays, education or special work. 
The city manager may grant a regular full-time employee a leave of absence without pay for a period of one day up to but not to exceed 12 calendar months for reasons of celebrations of religious holidays, education or special work which will permit the city/BLW to profit by the experience gained or the work performed. 
No benefits will be provided to any employee while on a leave of absence without pay for these reasons unless discontinuance and reinstatement of any such benefit is impractical due to the short length of the absence in the discretion of the human resources director. 
Performance Evaluations, Performance Awards and Longevity Bonuses. Any leave of absence without pay for four or more work weeks will result in a corresponding adjustment of evaluation date and, if eligible and funded by the city/BLW, the award of any performance raise or bonus or longevity bonus. 
The employee is required to keep the human resources department (payroll section) advised of his current address at all times. 
An employee is expected to return to work no later than the first work day of the week following the end of the requested leave of absence. Failure to do so will constitute abandonment of city/BLW employment.

A.  A department head, with the concurrence of the human resources director, shall have the right to direct any employee within such department to be examined by an individual or entity, including, but not limited to, a physician, psychologist, or any appropriate medical care provider, designated by the city/BLW at city/BLW expense to aid in determining fitness for duty and/or the ability to perform the essential functions of the position with or without a reasonable accommodation and/or whether the employee poses a direct threat to the health or safety of himself or others. Upon the discovery of a disability of any kind which, with or without a reasonable accommodation, precludes the ability to perform the essential functions of the position or results in the employee becoming a direct threat to the health and/or safety of himself or others, the employee will be allowed sick leave, pursuant to city/BLW policy, until able, by certification of the designated individual or entity, to perform the duties of his position, or if sick leave is exhausted, he may apply for a leave of absence without pay as provided under Section 4-4-16-090 of these policies and procedures. If the city/BLW concludes that the employee is not disabled, but cannot meet or satisfy the minimum fitness for duty requirements, it may take any appropriate action including, but not limited to termination of employment as provided under Section 4-4-8-040. 
B.  It is the policy of the city/BLW to make all employment decisions without regard to any disability status unless required as a bona fide job qualification. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1043; Ord. No. 5139, 3/10/93; Ord. No. 5362, 10/12/94; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1) 
ARTICLE 4-4-18 - SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR CONDUCT 

4-4-18-010 - Policy. 
A.  Sexual harassment is a form of employee misconduct which undermines the integrity of the work environment. Sexual harassment is also a form of sex discrimination in violation of various federal and state civil rights laws. 
B.  It is the policy of the city/BLW to seek prevention of sexual harassment of its employees and applicants for employment. 
(Code 1978, § 4-111; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96) 
4-4-18-020 - Rights and responsibilities. 
In order to preserve the rights of all employees to work in an environment free from sexual harassment and, also, to protect the legitimate privacy interests of innocent parties, the city/BLW will provide a method for the confidential resolution of sexual harassment complaints. All parties should but are not required to exhaust the informal remedies described herein before they resort to the formal grievance procedure. 
A.  Supervisory Responsibilities. Supervisors are responsible for maintaining a positive work environment, setting a good example for others and promptly investigating all complaints of sexual harassment to determine what, if any, remedial action may be warranted. In resolving sexual harassment complaints, supervisors should seek advice and guidance from the human resources director and cooperate fully with his efforts to resolve any complaints referred to the human resources director by other parties. Supervisors should strive first and foremost to prevent any recurrence of prohibited activities or retaliation against victims. 
B.  Aggrieved Employee/Applicant Responsibilities. 
1.  An aggrieved party should try to tell the aggressor directly that his behavior is unwelcome, harmful or offensive to the aggrieved party. Some offenders may be genuinely oblivious to the effect of their words or conduct on other people and would be willing to change if only they knew they were hurting or offending someone. Aggrieved parties are strongly encouraged to promptly report the incident to the offender's supervisor or department head, or alternatively to the human resources department, so as to minimize the risk of repeated incidents or retaliation by the aggressor. Although supervisors and managers of the city/BLW are to take appropriate action when they have reason to suspect that harassment has occurred, employees should not assume that the city/BLW is aware of any problem. It is also the employee's responsibility to bring any complaint to the attention of the management of the city/BLW so that the problem may be resolved. 
2.  Aggrieved parties should make reasonable, good faith efforts to resolve their complaints before they resort to the formal grievance process. However, failure to do so does not preclude resorting to the formal grievance procedure and/or disciplinary action or any other resolution by the appropriate manager as a result of such grievance. 
C.  Human Resources Director Responsibilities. 
1.  The human resources director shall facilitate the resolution of any complaints brought to his attention. Upon request, the human resources director will provide counseling and support to victims, supervisors and other involved parties. The human resources director shall serve as expert advisor to any supervisor who is part of the reviewing procedure in the formal grievance process. In this capacity, the director shall offer his best professional judgment as to whether certain allegations, if true, would constitute sexual harassment. 
2.  The human resources director is responsible for providing training to city/BLW supervisors and managers on the subject of sexual harassment. The training should provide supervisors with current information on applicable laws, rules, regulations and procedures and provide techniques for the careful investigation and mediation of sexual harassment allegations. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1112; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7028, 4/11/2007, § 8; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1) 
4-4-18-030 - Definitions. 
A.  "Sexual harassment" includes, but is not limited to, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature where: 
1.  Submission to said conduct is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition of an individual's employment; or 
2.  Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment or continued employment; or 
3.  Such conduct has the purpose or necessary effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating a hostile, intimidating or offensive work environment; or 
4.  Such conduct or behavior was known by the aggressor to be unwelcome, harmful or offensive; or 
5.  A person of average sensibilities would clearly have understood that the behavior or conduct was unwelcome, harmful or offensive. 
B.  "Work environment" is defined as any place where the business of the city/BLW is conducted in the name of the city/BLW or any department or division thereof. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1113; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96) 
4-4-18-040 - Resolution procedure. 
A.  Any employee or applicant for employment who, in good faith, believes that he may be a victim of sexual harassment should: 
1.  Immediately ask the alleged offender to stop doing the unwelcome, harmful or offensive conduct; and 
2.  Promptly contact the offending party's supervisor, department head or the human resources director for support and guidance. Successful resolution efforts will be greatly facilitated by the timely reporting of complaints. 
B.  The supervisor of the alleged offender and department head will promptly investigate the complaint and if the complaint is founded, will take appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. 
C.  The aggrieved party may also file a formal grievance as outlined in Article 4-4-20 of the personnel rules and regulations. Time limits for filing a formal grievance of sexual harassment are extended to 30 calendar days from the date of a specific alleged occurrence. If the alleged issue relates to on-going conditions, the employee may file a written grievance at any time. 
D.  The human resources director will advise all supervisors/managers regarding the substance of the formal charges. 
E.  If a complaint is filed against the human resources director, the city manager or his designee shall fulfill the role ascribed to the director of human resources. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1114; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7028, 4/11/2007, § 9; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1) 
4-4-18-050 - Remedial action. 
A.  In determining what remedial action may be appropriate, supervisors should consider the extent to which the offender knew or reasonably should have known that his conduct was unwelcome, harmful or offensive. Any person who: 
1.  Commits sexual harassment; or 
2.  Shirks his investigatory or supervisory responsibilities; or 
3.  Provides false witness against another; 
shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action including, but not limited to, referral to professional counseling at the offending party's expense; oral and written reprimands, performance probation, suspension or termination. 
B.  Some coercive behavior, such as threats or promises that employment reprisals or wards will follow the refusal or granting of sexual favors, constitutes gross misconduct and may provide just cause of immediate termination. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1115; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96) 
ARTICLE 4-4-20 - DISCIPLINARY ACTION POLICY AND PROCEDURE 

4-4-20-010 - Goal and purpose. 
A.  The goal of the city/BLW is to provide quality public services to the citizens and customers of the city/BLW. The establishment and maintenance of a cooperative and goal oriented work atmosphere is a responsibility of all employees and will go a long way toward eliminating serious disciplinary problems. If, however, disciplinary problems do arise, supervisors and department heads should make every effort to ensure that employees have a thorough understanding of city/BLW policies and an awareness of what is expected in job behavior and performance. 
B.  The purpose of this policy is to provide a means to encourage employees to change their behavior through disciplinary action. The application of these guidelines must be consistent and equitable among all employees and departments so that employees receive like treatment for similar offenses. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1121; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96) 
4-4-20-020 - Definitions. 
A.  Adverse Action. An adverse action is an action taken by the appointing authority or his designee that results in monetary loss due to disciplinary suspension without pay, disciplinary demotion or disciplinary dismissal. 
B.  Conduct Undermining the Operations of the City/BLW. Any conduct or actions on the part of any employee which tends to jeopardize or reduce the efficient operation of the city/BLW in the delivery of services to the public, including the interference with the performance or duties of any other employee, through harassment or other methods, on or off the job. 
C.  Delinquency. Vandalism; nonpayment of debts owed to the city; or absences or tardiness to work. 
D.  Disciplinary Demotion. An employee may be demoted from one pay range (grade) to a lower range (grade) for disciplinary reasons. A disciplinary demotion will include a decrease in salary. 
E.  Insubordination: The refusal by an employee to perform work assigned or comply with the written or verbal instructions of any supervisor who is entitled to give such direction and have it obeyed. 
F.  Negligence. The failure to exercise reasonable and ordinary care under the circumstances. 
G.  Sexual Harassment. See Article 4-4-18. 
H.  Unauthorized Absence. An absence from work either not authorized by an employee's supervisor or not covered under the paid leave or leave of absence policies; see Article 4-4-16. 
I.  Under the Influence of Alcohol. Under the influence of alcohol shall mean any measurable amount of alcohol as measured by blood, breath or urine tests while the employee is on duty or subject to be called back to duty in a paid stand-by status, unless such measurement of alcohol is the result of consumption of alcohol or an alcohol related product that is prescribed by a licensed physician. Employees will be subject for testing who have the smell of alcohol on their breath which is capable of being smelled by another, or visible impairment of their normal abilities. Departments may have requirements more restrictive than the above limitations (see Article 4-4-26). 
J.  Under the Influence of Illegal Drugs (including the combination of drugs and alcohol). Under the influence of illegal drugs shall mean any measurable amount of illegal drugs as measured by blood or urine tests while the employee is on duty or subject to be called back to duty in a paid stand-by status.

(Code 1978, § 4-1122; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96) 
4-4-20-030 - Procedure. 
A.  The procedure listed below is intended to assist supervisors and department heads in determining a proper course of action when discipline is needed. Any employee who violates any of the established personnel policies, a directives or operational, safety or departmental rules shall be disciplined depending on the severity and/or frequency of the violation. 
B.  Severity can generally be interpreted in the following manner: 
1.  Minor. Not a threat to the safety or well-being of persons (employees, citizens, customers), property or the organization. 
2.  Serious. A threat to the safety or well-being of persons (employees, citizens, customers), property or the organization. 
3.  Major. Matters that cannot be tolerated. (Example: Fighting on the job; sale of illegal drugs, etc.). 
C.  The city/BLW will utilize a corrective or progressive system of discipline to encourage employees to change their behavior in matters that can be described a "minor" in severity level. However, matters described as "serious" or "major" will be handled on a case by case basis. 
D.  Supervisory staff has the right and responsibility to correct employee behavior by recommending disciplinary action. The department head and/or their designee, subject to the appeal rights of regular employees, shall have the following alternatives for taking disciplinary action, again depending upon the severity and/or frequency of the incident or like occurrences: 
1.  Verbal Reprimand. An employee may be called in for private counseling by his supervisor, division manager or department head regarding unacceptable behavioral patterns or work performance standards. The department head or designee should record the giving of such verbal reprimand by documenting on a notice of counseling form which shall indicate the date of the counseling session, subject matter, and remedial action to be taken and timeframe, if any. The employee should, but is not required to acknowledge receipt of the notice of counseling form by their signature. Signing of the notice of counseling form does not indicate agreement with the action taken and failure to sign does not negate the disciplinary action. The notice of counseling is a departmental record and does not need to be sent to the human resources department unless it is to support subsequent disciplinary action(s). Verbal reprimands can be neither grieved nor appealed. 
2.  Written Reprimand. A written reprimand may be given to an employee by his department head or specified designee when: 
a.  A verbal reprimand has not resulted in the desired improvement; or 
b.  When the initial actions required greater discipline than a verbal warning. 
An employee should, but is not required to, acknowledge receipt of all written disciplinary actions by their signature. Signing of the disciplinary action form does not indicate agreement with the action taken and failure to sign does not negate the disciplinary action. A copy of notice of written reprimand shall be filed in the employee's personnel file in the human resources department. All supporting documentation should be attached to the disciplinary action form. Written reprimands can be neither grieved nor appealed. However, the employee has the right to: a) discuss the written reprimand with the department head or specified designee and/or b) submit a written statement to be attached to the written reprimand and with any copy of such reprimand. 
3.  Suspension Without Pay. Prior to a final decision regarding a suspension without pay, a regular status employee (who has successfully completed his work test period) will be given a hearing before the department head. Written notice of that hearing will be submitted to the employee by the department head or their designee at least 24 hours before the time of the hearing. Notice shall be hand delivered to the employee or personally delivered to the employee's home, leaving it with the employee or with a person of suitable age and discretion residing therein. If the employee cannot, after due diligence, be located, notice shall be sent by regular and certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice will specifically state the alleged grounds for which the suspension without pay is being considered, including a summary of the incident(s) from which the proposed disciplinary action arose. The employee will then have an opportunity at the hearing to explain, rebut or otherwise respond to the information upon which the proposed action is being taken. 
A department head may suspend an employee without pay for up to 56 hours for fire personnel and 40 hours for all other personnel. A department head may suspend an employee without pay for periods exceeding 56 hours for fire personnel and 40 hours for all other personnel up to a maximum of 112 hours for fire personnel and 80 hours for all other personnel after informing the city manager and human resources director of the proposed disciplinary action. Failure to inform the city manager and human resources director shall not invalidate such disciplinary action. 
4.  Administrative Leave With Pay. During the investigation, hearing, or trial of an employee on a criminal charge or during the course of a civil action involving an employee, when allowing the employee to continue to perform his regular duties would be, in the opinion of the department head and the human resources director, detrimental to the city's legitimate interests, the department head may authorize administrative leave with pay of the employee for the duration of the proceedings as a nondisciplinary action. The department head may also authorize administrative leave with pay for non-disciplinary reasons pending investigation by the city of a suspected disciplinary infraction. 
5.  Demotion. Prior to a final decision to demote an employee, a regular status employee (who has successfully completed his work test period) will be given a hearing before the department head. Written notice of that hearing will be submitted to the employee by the department head or their designee at least 24 hours before the time of the hearing. Notice shall be hand delivered to the employee or personally delivered to the employee's home, leaving it with the employee or with a person of suitable age and discretion residing therein. If the employee cannot, after due diligence, be located, notice shall be sent by regular and certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice will specifically state the alleged grounds for which the demotion is being considered, including a summary of the incident(s) from which the proposed disciplinary action arose. The employee will then have an opportunity at the hearing to explain, rebut or otherwise respond to the information upon which the proposed action is being taken. 
An employee who is unsatisfactory in his present position may be demoted for disciplinary reasons if, in the opinion of his department head or specified designee, he shows reasonable promise of becoming a satisfactory employee in another position. An employee who is demoted for disciplinary reasons shall be relieved of his present duties and responsibilities and assigned new duties and responsibilities which are less difficult and demanding and which will provide the employee a lower salary. This option is only available if a lower level authorized position is vacant or is created by the authorization of the city manager to downgrade an authorized position. 
6.  Transfers that involve no reduction in salary or benefits do not constitute a demotion and can neither be grieved nor appealed, even if the transfer involves a change of duties, responsibilities and authority. 
7.  Dismissal. 
a.  A department head may dismiss an employee for cause after informing the city manager and human resources director of the proposed disciplinary action. Failure to inform the city manager and human resources director shall not invalidate the dismissal. The human resources director shall serve as expert advisor to the department head regarding all dismissal actions. Prior to a final decision regarding dismissal, a regular status employee (who has successfully completed his work test period) will be given a hearing before the department head. Written notice of that hearing will be submitted to the employee by the department head or their designee at least 24 hours before the time of the hearing. Notice shall be hand delivered to the employee or personally delivered to the employee's home, leaving it with the employee or with a person of suitable age and discretion residing therein. If the employee cannot, after due diligence, be located, notice shall be sent by regular and certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice will specifically state the alleged grounds for which termination is being considered, including a summary of the incident(s) from which the proposed dismissal action arose. The employee will then have an opportunity at the hearing to explain, rebut or otherwise respond to the information upon which the proposed action is being taken. 
b.  If discharge action is taken subsequent to the departmental hearing, the employee shall be furnished notice of the discharge in writing stating the reasons and his rights to appeal the dismissal, if applicable. The notice and attachments become a permanent record unless modified by appeal action. 
c.  Employees classified, as department heads who are employed in that capacity after February 9, 1994 are at-will employees of the city/BLW. However, any police chief and fire chief are exempted from these provisions and will be hired and may be terminated in compliance with the City Charter Section 4-12-1. Any other such department head may be discharged at any time within the discretion of the city manager, with or without cause. Prior to discharging a department head without cause or for cause deemed by the city manager to be beyond the department heads control as defined below, the city manager shall advise the city council in executive session of this intent; provided, that his omission to do so shall not affect the effectiveness of the discharge. 
d.  Upon his discharge, a department head hired after February 9, 1994, may be eligible for severance benefits as follows: (1) severance pay equal to an amount up to four times his most recent gross weekly salary, the amount of which is dependent upon whether or not such executive finds other employment within four weeks after the effective date of the discharge; and (2) continued participation in the city/BLW health insurance program at full predischarge levels at the expense of the city/BLW for a period up to four weeks from the date of separation, or until covered by another health insurance program, whichever occurs first. To qualify for these severance benefits, an otherwise eligible executive, as defined below, shall, in writing and in a form approved by the city attorney, release the city/BLW and its elected and appointed officials, officers and employees in both their official capacity and personally, from any and all claims relating to his employment or the termination thereof, and shall likewise relinquish rights to a grievance/appeal hearing as provided herein. 
e.  Only a department head hired after February 9, 1994, is eligible for the above described severance benefits if and only if he is discharged without cause or for cause deemed by the city manager within his discretion to be beyond the department head's control (for example—reductions in force; elimination of a department; inability to perform job requirements at acceptable levels despite consistent demonstrable attempts to do so, etc.). Additionally, an eligible department head, upon being notified by the city manager that discharge is imminent, may choose instead to resign his employment voluntarily without loss of eligibility for severance benefits. A department head hired after February 9, 1994, who is discharged for cause as set forth in subparagraphs 1. through 24. of Section 4-4-20-040 of this chapter or other provisions of these rules and regulations or for any cause deemed by the city manager within his discretion to be contrary to the interests of the city/BLW shall not be eligible for severance benefits. 
E.  At each level up to discharge action, employees will be warned that failure to correct their behavior, will result in specific, more severe disciplinary action. 
F.  Notification of Disciplinary Suspension, Demotion or Dismissal. When an employee is suspended, demoted or dismissed by his department head, the department head shall immediately provide the employee with written notice of the action taken, the effective date, the reasons for the action and the recourse available to the employee under the provisions of these rules and regulations. A copy of such notice shall be furnished to the human resources director with copies of all supporting documentation. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1123; Ord. No. 5140, 3/10/93, §§ 1, 2; Ord. No. 5262, 2/9/94; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7028, 4/11/2007, § 10; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, §§ 1, 8)

The human resources director and the city manager shall review proposed personnel or safety rules and regulations.

It is the policy of the city/BLW to resolve grievances informally if at all possible. Supervisors and managers are expected to make every effort to discuss and resolve problems as they arise. However, there may be grievances or appeals of disciplinary actions which can only be resolved after a formal review. This review process is outlined below.

Temporary and part-time and employees serving an initial working test period may grieve discriminatory matters as provided under Article 4-4-4, equal employment opportunity policy of these rules and regulations. 
2.  Police and fire personnel serving under civil service rules and regulations may utilize the provisions of this article only if they make an affirmative written waiver of their grievance and/or appeal rights to the civil service board. 
3.  If any eligible employee is denied the opportunity to present a complaint, grievance or appeal, as prescribed by this article, or if the employee is threatened or subjected to harassment or duress when presenting the complaint, the employee should notify the aggressor's department head, or in case of the department head as the aggressor, the city manager, and the human resources director in writing who will jointly initiate an investigation of any such complaint. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1142; Ord. No. 5262, 2/9/94; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1) 
4-4-22-030 - Formal grievance procedure. 
A.  Regular Employees Department Heads Hired Prior to February 9, 1994. 
1.  If a grievance arises from the action of an official higher than the immediate supervisor, the grievance may be initiated at Step 2 or 3, as appropriate. At no time will an employee bypass a supervisor and/or department head that were involved in the grieved or appealed action. 
2.  The human resources director shall serve as advisor of all parties involved of the correct procedural handling of each particular grievance/appeal including the determination of whether an issue is grievable. 
3.  Employees are free to seek legal counsel at their expense at any time. However, the employee may be represented by counsel at Step 3 only and such representation is limited to opening and closing statements and written documentation supporting their client's case. Otherwise, employees are required to speak for themselves. It is the intent of this provision to encourage discussion between employees and supervisory staff on matters of mutual concern. 
4.  If a grievance/appeal meeting or hearing is held during the normal work hours of any required participant, such participant shall be excused without loss of pay for that purpose. Attendance at grievance/appeal meetings or hearings held outside of normal work hours for any participant shall not be deemed as time worked. 
5.  Failure to initiate a grievance/appeal within the time limit shall be deemed a waiver of the grievance/appeal. Failure at any step of this procedure to submit a grievance/appeal to the next step within the specified time limit shall be deemed to be acceptance of the decision at that step. 
6.  Failure at any step of this procedure to communicate the decision on a grievance/appeal within the specified time limit shall permit the employee to proceed to the next step as set forth in the preceding paragraph. 
7.  Failure of the employee to cooperate, participate and meet as needed will result in dismissal of the grievance/appeal. 
8.  The time limits of the procedure maybe extended by the human resources director due to illness, vacations, business travel or other legitimate reasons. If an extension is required, involved all parties will be notified. 
9.  This procedure is the only formal process to handle employee complaints. At no time shall an employee approach the mayor or any council member or BLW board member to resolve a grievance or appeal. 
10.  The entire written portion of an employee's grievance/appeal and disposition at any level shall be kept in a separate file in the human resources department, under the jurisdiction of the human resources director, and will not be placed in any other file whatsoever. 
11.  Any employee who resigns from city/BLW shall be deemed to have waived the right to initiate or to process a grievance or appeal. 
B.  Department Heads Hired After February 9, 1994. Department heads hired after February 9, 1994, do not have the right to administrative appeal, grievance procedures or hearing rights. A post-employment name-clearing hearing for such department heads may be conducted at the discretion of the city manager. However, any police chief and fire chief are exempted from these provisions and will be hired and may be terminated in compliance with the City Charter Section 4-12.1. 
1.  Step 1: Division Level. 
a.  An employee who feels he has a valid reason for complaint should complete the city/BLW grievance/appeal form and submit the completed and signed form to his direct supervisor and/or division manager with a copy to the human resources director within seven calendar days following the incident that gave rise to the complaint. If the grievance is related to ongoing working conditions such as harassment or discrimination, the employee may file a written grievance at any time. 
b.  In filing a complaint, the employee should specifically state what action is being grieved or appealed; provide a description of the incident from the employee's perspective including persons involved, dates, time and relevant facts; specific provision(s) of the personnel rules and regulations that the incident pertains to; a statement as to why the employee feels the grievance or appeal is justified; state the remedy sought by defining the action the employee believes should be taken if the grievance or appeal is upheld. 
c.  The supervisor and/or division manager shall meet with the employee to discuss the grievance/appeal and communicate a decision in writing to the employee within seven calendar days following receipt of the grievance/appeal. A copy of the division manager's decision shall be sent to the department head and the human resources department. 
2.  Step 2: Department Level. If the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, the employee may submit the grievance form to his department head, with a copy to the human resources director within seven calendar days after receipt of the decision at Step 1. The department head shall meet with the employee to discuss the grievance and communicate a decision in writing to the employee within seven calendar days following receipt of the written grievance. A copy of the department head's decision shall be sent to the human resources department. 
3.  Step 3: City Manager Level. 
a.  This step is the final level of grievance review and/or appeal for all employees who do not report directly to the city manager. If the grievance is not resolved at Step 2, within seven calendar days of receipt of the department head's decision, the employee may submit the grievance with all supporting documents including copies of decisions rendered at Steps 1 and 2 to the city manager. 
b.  The city manager will conduct, or designate an impartial individual to conduct either: 
(1)  A separate investigation of the grievance to discuss the complaint with the grievant, including a meeting accompanied by his representative if the employee desires representation; or 
(2)  A hearing, if the grievance/appeal concerns an adverse action as defined in Section 4-4-20-020. If necessary, the city manager or his designee will conduct a hearing on the grieved or appealed issue at which all-appropriate witnesses and supporting information shall be heard. The hearing shall be recorded. The grievant or appellant may, if he so desires, obtain a copy of the recording at his own expense. The evidentiary portion of this hearing shall be open to the press and public; however, the deliberation of the findings shall occur in closed session. After the city manager or his designee has heard from all involved parties, he will close the meeting. 
After consideration of written materials and testimony given at the hearing, if the city manager has designated a hearing officer, such hearing officer will issue a recommendation to the city manager. The grievant/appellant and appropriate department head will receive copies of the hearing officer's recommendation. 
The city manager shall communicate a decision in writing to the employee and to the representative, if any, within 30 days following receipt of the written grievance or following the meeting or hearing or following receipt of the recommended decision, whichever is later. Such decision shall be final. 
C.  Employees Hired or Promoted Into in a Formal Apprenticeship Program on or After July 1, 2007. Employees hired or promoted into a formal apprenticeship program, such as apprentice electrical lineworker on or after July 1, 2007, do not have the right to administrative appeal, grievance procedures or hearing rights except that such employees have the right to utilize the procedure outlined herein to file complaints of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex, disability and political affiliation in accordance with Article 4-4-4. A post-employment name clearing hearing for such employees may be conducted at the discretion of the city manager. 
D.  Procedure for Appeals from Actions of the City Manager. This procedure is available to those department heads and employees who report directly to the city manager to assure these employees have access to due process. An employee in this category who feels he has a valid reason for complaint from actions of the city manager should complete the city/BLW grievance/appeal form and submit the completed and signed form to the city manager with a copy to the human resources director within seven calendar days following the incident that gave rise to the complaint. If the grievance is related to ongoing working conditions such as harassment or discrimination, the employee may file a written grievance at any time. 
In filing a complaint, the employee should specifically state what action is being grieved or appealed; provide a description of the incident from the employee's perspective including persons involved, dates, time and relevant facts; specific provisions of the personnel rules and regulations that the incident pertains to; a statement as to why the employee feels the grievance or appeal is justified; state the remedy sought by defining the action the employee believes should be taken if the grievance or appeal is upheld. 
Since the city manager was the individual taking the aggrieved action, the human resources director shall call for the establishment of an ad hoc hearing board to hear the grievance/appeal. The human resources director or his designee shall communicate the hearing board's final decision in writing to the employee and to the city manager within five days following receipt of the hearing board's decision. 
E.  Grievance/Appeal Board to Hear Complaints from Actions of the City Manager. The ad hoc grievance/appeal board is established to hear the grievance or appeal of an employee who directly reports to the city manager, the board shall be composed of: 
1.  A part-time municipal court judge as nonvoting chairperson of the board. The mayor shall select one of the judges from the current personnel roster. 
2.  The human resources director shall select from the current personnel roster or the pension payroll, two individuals to serve as members of the board as follows: 
a.  One appointee to this board shall be a current division manager from a city department other than the department of the grievant. 
b.  One appointee to this board may be a current or retired division manager or a retired department head. This appointment should be from a city department other than the department of the grievant and the department of the appointee selected by the human resources director in subparagraph (2)(a) of this section. 
3.  The mayor shall select a person who is not a current or retired city/BLW employee and who is a Marietta citizen to serve as the third member of the appeal board. 
The chairperson shall determine the procedural rules for the ad hoc grievance/appeal board hearing. The chairperson may also request the city attorney to serve as legal advisor to the grievance/appeal board. The city attorney shall attend the hearing, but shall not be involved in the closed, decision making process of the board or in the deliberations of the board. However, the city attorney shall be available to answer any questions that may arise during the closed session. 
All members of this board shall be persons who have no personal relationships with any part to the grievance, that is, not related by blood or marriage, business partners, close personal friends or other relationship or circumstances that would tend to bias the judgment of the board members for or against any party to the grievance or appeal. 
There shall be no private, one to one conversations between individual board members and any party to the grievance concerning the merits of the grievance or appeal at any time during the course of the proceedings. 
The grievance/appeal board shall hold a hearing on the grieved or appealed issue at which all appropriate witnesses and supporting information shall be heard as determined by the board. The hearing shall be recorded. The grievant or appellant may, if he so desires, obtain a copy of the recording at his own expense. This recording shall be the only official record of the hearing. The evidentiary portion of the hearing before the board shall be open to the press and public, however, the deliberation of the findings of the board shall occur in closed session. After the board has heard from all involved parties, the chairperson will close the meeting. Only the voting members of the board shall be party to the deliberation of the findings of the board. After consideration of written materials and testimony given at the hearing, the board will issue through the chairperson a decision to the human resources director. The grievant/appellant and the city manager will receive copies of the board's decision which shall be final, subject to the right of appeal by either the city or the employee to a court of proper jurisdiction.

4-4-22-040 - Salary of suspended, demoted, or dismissed employees. 
A.  Disciplinary action in the form of suspensions and demotions shall become effective upon the employee's receipt of the notice of the department head's decision following the informal hearing as described in Article 4-4-20, disciplinary policy and procedure. In the event the employee appeals such disciplinary action and said action is reversed or modified, then the employee shall be allowed back pay and benefits as consistent with the decision. 
B.  From the time of the employee's receipt of the notice of dismissal following the departmental hearing until the dismissal becomes effective, such employee shall be considered suspended without pay pending discharge investigation. During such period of suspension without pay, said employee shall continue to be an employee of the city/BLW and allowed all benefits and accruals pertaining thereto, except said employee shall not be allowed to work, appear on city/BLW property or work sites except on official business, or receive any salary or wages.

4-4-24-010 - Purpose. 
A.  It is the policy of the city/BLW to establish and maintain a fair and equitable pay and classification system for all employees covered by these rules and regulations. The pay and classification plan, which is directly related to position classification, is the basis of compensation for employees and is designed to attempt to reflect: 
1.  Relative difficulty and responsibility between jobs. 
2.  Competitive rates of pay for similar types of work in public and private employment in the labor market where the city/BLW recruits for employees. 
3.  Economic conditions of the job market area. 
4.  Economic conditions of and funds available to the city/BLW. 
5.  Financial policies of the city. 
6.  Other business and operational considerations. 
The pay and classification plan is the official and approved system of grouping positions into appropriate pay grades and provides guidelines for administration. 
B.  The pay and classification plan is the foundation upon which all major phases of the personnel program are constructed and should be used as follows: 
1.  A guide in recruiting and evaluating candidates for employment. 
2.  To determine lines of promotions and developing an employee training program. 
3.  To determine the salary range for each position. 
4.  To provide uniform pay information which is understood by city officials, employees and the general public. 
5.  To assist in maintaining and revising organizational structure, clarifying lines of authority and affixing responsibility. 
(Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 12) 
4-4-24-020 - Content. 
A "position" is a set of assigned tasks, duties, and responsibilities requiring full-or part-time employment of one person. A position may be occupied or vacant. Each position will be assigned a classification and an appropriate pay range. Classifications and pay ranges shall be listed in the city pay and classification plan. 
Position descriptions are descriptive statements about every position in the organization. The position description contains a position/classification title, specific duties and responsibilities of that position, training and experience requirements and other descriptive information defining the position. 
A classification title is the official designation or name given to the written description of a position and shall be used on all official and personnel records. 
The plan shall establish a salary range for every classification in the city/BLW. Such salary ranges shall be determined with due regard to ranges of pay for other classes, relative difficulty and responsibility of positions in the class, availability of employees in particular occupational categories, prevailing rates of pay for similar employment in the city, rates of pay in other governmental jurisdictions, cost of living factors, the financial policies of the city, and other economic considerations. 
(Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 12) 
4-4-24-030 - Administration. 
A.  Responsibility for Administration of the Pay and Classification Plan. The human resources director shall be responsible for administering the pay and classification plan on a fair and equitable basis and shall be responsible for interpreting the application of the plan regarding compensation concerns not specifically covered by these guidelines. The human resources director shall make or cause to have made such comparative studies as he deems necessary of the factors affecting the level of salary ranges prior to the preparation of the annual budget as well as at other times. On the basis of information derived from such studies, the city manager shall recommend to the city commission such changes in salary ranges as he deems necessary to maintain the fairness and adequacy of the overall salary structure. The human resources director may request other officials and/or employees to assist in this process. 
Human resources shall be responsible for developing and maintaining position descriptions, revision of existing position descriptions, and the abolishment of position descriptions that are no longer needed. 
B.  Maintenance of the Plan. Should the duties and responsibilities of a position change, the official position description may be amended. All proposed amendments are to be evaluated by the human resources department to determine if revision to the position description needs to be made or a change in classification is warranted. The review and analysis of the updated duties and responsibilities may result in one of these actions: 
1.  A determination that no change is necessary. 
2.  The position is properly classified, but the duties have changed sufficiently to warrant revising the position description, and in some cases, the descriptions for closely related classifications. 
3.  The position may merit reclassification to a currently established higher or lower level classification, which requires a change in the assigned pay grade and/or job title. 
4.  The position merits reclassification to a new classification which requires the official establishment of position description. 
5.  The reallocation of a position to another classification may result in the abolition of the classification and the subsequent removal of the position description from the pay and classification plan. 
The review and analysis of duties and responsibilities may also result in a change in the position's exemption status as may be required by the regulations of the FLSA. 
C.  Position Review. 
1.  Each time a vacancy occurs, the position shall be reviewed by the department head to determine whether the position has changed. If so, then the department head will submit the altered functions to the human resources department for an evaluation to determine if the changed responsibilities impact the classification of the position. If the department revisions are minor and do not impact the classification of the position, the position description will be revised prior to posting and advertising of the vacant position. If the department revisions to the vacant position indicate major changes to the essential duties and responsibilities of that position, the department head should make a reclassification request during the normal budget schedule unless the city manager specifically authorizes a reclassification review within the fiscal year. 
2.  The human resources department may review and make recommendations to revise the pay and classification plan during the annual budget process or as when needed during the budget year with approval of the city manager and council. 
3.  Requests for position classification or reclassification may be initiateby a department head or an incumbent employee during the budget process when it is believed that a significant change in the duties of a particular position has occurred. Requests should be submitted on a position description questionnaire (PDQ) signed by the employee, their immediate supervisor and department head. Human resources shall be responsible for reviewing all reclassification requests and completing necessary job audits to determine appropriate classification. If a suitable classification does not exist, human resources shall recommend the establishment of a new classification for inclusion in the pay and classification plan. 
4.  The city manager may authorize a review of the pay and classification plan by an independent consultant. 
Any recommended classification or exemption status changes that are approved by the city council shall become effective when approved or as otherwise designated by council. 
D.  Position Control. All positions in the city/BLW are established and maintained through a personnel budget each fiscal year in accordance with established budgeting and accounting procedures. The establishment of new or additional positions or upward reclassification of approved positions will require approval by the city council. Downward reclassification and lateral changes of approved positions will require the approval of the city manager. 
E.  [Change in Exemption Status.] Any change in exemption status will require approval of the city manager and city council. 
(Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 12) 
4-4-24-040 - Appeals. 
A.  An employee shall have the right to appeal changes to his position classification or lack there-of and/or exemption status. Any employee who feels that the job description describing their position or exemption status was improperly or inadequately evaluated will submit an appeal to review his position description and/or exemption status. Any request to appeal a decision regarding reclassification of a position or exemption status under the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act shall include a completed position description questionnaire, (PDQ), indicating the changes in duties and responsibilities since the original request that is signed by the employee, the employee's immediate supervisor and department director. 
B.  The employee should submit the completed PDQ to his immediate supervisor/manager. The supervisor/manager shall review the information provided by the employee in the PDQ, complete the information requested in the PDQ from the supervisor and shall forward the document to his department head. The department head shall review the information provided by the employee and supervisor, sign the PDQ and forward the questionnaire to the human resources department. All documentation sent to the human resources department will be copied to the employee. 
C.  The human resources director and/or his designee will meet with the employee, the department head and such other persons as may be necessary to clarify the required duties and responsibilities of the position(s). A job audit of the position(s) based on observation of tasks performed may be conducted at the job site(s). 
D.  After the information is collected on the position, the human resources director and/or his designee shall review the assignment of the job classification and/or exemption status and reassess the evaluation. The human resources director shall make a recommendation to the city manager for final action on the appeal. 
E.  At each stage, the employee shall be kept advised of the status of the appeal. The process up to the human resources director level shall be completed within six calendar weeks, but may be extended by the human resources director for reasons of business necessity. At all levels, an attempt should be made to expeditiously resolve the employee's question either through correction in the employee's responsibilities, a correction in the evaluation results, or education of the employee on how the system works and the reasoning behind the decisions reached. 
F.  Under no circumstances will any appeal be accepted for review at any level on the basis of pay. This is a management decision based on assessment of the employee's actual position duties and responsibilities. 
G.  The effective date of any action, which impacts the employee's pay, shall be the date of the final decision. Any additional funding, position upgrade, or exemption status change deemed necessary as a result of the reclassification appeal is subject to the approval by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 12) 
4-4-24-050 - Pay schedules. 
Formal pay schedules will be developed and shall include position classification titles, pay grades/ranges, FLSA exemption status, EEOC job category and position numbers for purposes of payroll. Proposed pay schedules may be accepted, modified, or rejected by council. Council-approved schedules shall be available to all employees and shall be used by management in setting individual employee pay under the following guidelines. 
(Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 12) 
4-4-24-060 - Original appointment. 
Pay offered to newly hired employees shall be at an initial pay range that falls within the first quartile of the pay grade designated for the position, with some exceptions as noted below. When the city is unable to recruit qualified applicants or when an applicant possesses exceptional qualifications warranting employment above the first quartile, the department head may request authorization, in advance of making a job offer, to hire up to the mid-point for technical and professional positions only, with approval by the human resources director. These positions are designated in the pay plan as having an EEOC category of 01, 02, or 03. 
Newly appointed or promoted department heads/executives may be compensated at any rate within the approved pay grade for the position as approved by the city manager so long as the salary does not exceed the maximum of the assigned pay grade. 
Appointments of candidates into a formal apprenticeship program or into a specific career development program, such as apprentice electrical line worker or line worker position, will be compensated according to the line worker pay plan provisions specific to those programs as adopted annually by the city council. 
The human resources director may authorize the hire of temporary employees at a rate of pay less than the minimum of the classification. Temporary employees on the city/BLW payroll shall be paid only for actual hours worked. 
(Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 12; Ord. No. 7526, 3/9/2011, § 1) 
4-4-24-070 - Trainee status. 
Positions designated as trainee positions may be filled on a temporary basis, at a rate below the minimum salary of the pay grade. Pay rates shall be determined by the length of the training program so that, upon acquisition of required training and experience, the incumbent may be placed at the minimum salary in the pay grade. 
(Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 12) 
4-4-24-080 - Promotional appointment. 
A.  The movement of a current employee from a position in one pay grade to a position in a higher pay grade shall be considered a promotion. Promotional appointments shall be made at a minimum increase of five percent above the employee's current pay rate provided the new pay rate falls within the higher pay grade's range. A maximum promotional pay increase up to ten percent above the employee's current pay rate may be offered if the amount falls within the pay range of the promotional pay grade and (1) justification can clearly be demonstrated based on the employee's experience, education, skills, and abilities; (2) with written consent of the human resources director (3) and with approval of the city manager. All promotional appointments and salary increases shall be made upon the recommendation of the department head and the human resources director, subject to the approval of the city manager. 
B.  Current employees promoted to supervisory positions (supervisory position shall be defined as an employee who has supervisory authority and responsibility over one or more employees on a regular basis) shall be paid as provided in paragraph A of this section. New employees hired into supervisory positions shall abide by the policy stated in Section 4-4-24-060, Original Appointment. 
C.  Department heads shall take into consideration the skills, abilities, education, experience, and any/all other relevant requirements necessary to perform the essential functions of the job as well as equitable treatment under the law (as stated in Article 4-4-4, Equal Employment Opportunity) when considering placement in the pay range for both new hires and promotional employees. Consideration should be given to all these factors when comparing a new hire or promotional employee to the incumbent employees in similar positions within the department. Decisions regarding appropriate and equitable pay should be based on the determining factors of (1) equal opportunity, (2) relevant skill, (3) required education, (4) related ability, (5) years of related experience, and (6) pay of other employees in the same department and pay grade. All pay decisions shall be decided in an equitable manner based on the candidate's ability to perform essential functions of the position and how closely they meet the requirements of the position. New hires and promotional employees should be placed in the pay range at the appropriate level at the time of hire or promotion commensurate with their qualifications. 
D.  Promoted employees shall serve a working test period the duration of which is determined by the position occupied. The working test period in the promoted position may be extended, with the approval of the human resources director, a maximum of an additional three-month period. Upon successful completion of the promotional working test period, the employee will be granted regular status in the new position. There is no increase at the end of the promotional working test period. 
(Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 12; Ord. No. 7197, 7/9/2008, § 1; Ord. No. 7526, 3/9/2011, § 1) 
4-4-24-090 - Demotion. 
Demotion is defined as the assignment of an employee from a position in one classification to a position in another classification assigned a lower pay grade. Employees involuntarily demoted shall be paid at a rate that is a minimum of five percent less than the employee's current rate of pay. If the amount exceeds the maximum pay for the lower pay grade, the employee will be paid at the top of the scale for the lower pay grade. 
When an employee requests a voluntary demotion he will be placed in the newly assigned pay grade for the lower position at a five percent reduction in his current pay. However, if it can be demonstrated to be in the best interest of the city/BLW, and with the prior consent of the human resources director and approval by the city manager, the employee may be paid at a rate that is within the approved range for the lower level position that does not exceed the employee's pay in his previous position or the employee may be "red-lined" so that the employee's current pay rate is frozen until the pay rate falls within the specified range of the lower assigned pay grade with approval by the city manager. If the employee is "red-lined" they shall not be entitled to any base salary increase until the schedule is adjusted to include his salary. 
If an employee accepts an involuntary demotion, the department director may recommend an appropriate rate of pay in the pay grade to which the employee has been assigned. However, the newly assigned rate of pay will be at least five percent lower than his previous rate. 
(Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 12; Ord. No. 7526, 3/9/2011, § 1) 
4-4-24-100 - Lateral transfers. 
An employee who is transferred to a different position in the same pay grade as his current position may continue at his current pay rate as long as it can be demonstrated by the department head that the salary offered is appropriate based on the employee's skills, education, and experience as required by the job description. 
(Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 12; Ord. No. 7526, 3/9/2011, § 1) 
4-4-24-110 - Reclassifications. 
When an employee's position is reclassified to a lower grade and his salary is above the maximum of the lower grade, the employee shall be "red-lined" or permitted to continue at the rate of pay at the time of reclassification during the period of his incumbency, but shall not be entitled to any base salary increase until the schedule is adjusted to include his salary. 
When an employee's position is approved by council to be reclassified to a higher pay grade, the incumbent will be placed in the newly assigned pay grade at their prior salary unless that salary is below the minimum of the newly assigned pay grade. If the employee's prior salary is below the newly assigned pay grade minimum, the employee will be placed at the minimum of the assigned pay grade. 
(Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 12; Ord. No. 7526, 3/9/2011, § 1) 
4-4-24-120 - Compensation policies and procedures. 
A.  Overtime. The city/BLW will comply with the requirements as outlined in the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, and the U.S. Department of Labor's regulations pertaining thereto. 
1.  The city will utilize a partial exemption from the overtime pay requirements of Section 7(k) of the FLSA for fire protection and law enforcement personnel as defined in the FLSA, as amended. Firefighters have a work cycle of 21 days. Police officers have a work cycle of seven days. In the event any firefighter remains on duty after the expiration of his regularly scheduled shift due to a bona fide emergency situation, as determined by the fire chief, such firefighter shall be compensated at the overtime rate, regardless of whether such additional work places the employee in an overtime situation based on the defined work period as described above. 
2.  The list of exempt and non-exempt positions will be a part of the pay and classification plans established for each budget year. In accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, employees who are classified as exempt are paid a fixed salary for each payroll period. Therefore, exempt employees who have absences of less than one day, after authorized leave balances have been exhausted, will not have their salary reduced for such absence. This provision is effective retroactive to April 15, 1986. 
3.  An exempt employee's disciplinary suspension without pay (in increments of a full day) for serious workplace misconduct does not impugn such employee's exempt or salaried status. Examples of such serious misconduct includes, but is not limited to: sexual harassment, violence in the workplace or threats thereof, drug or alcohol violations, safety violations of major significance, violation of federal and state laws, or other conduct which may be deemed a threat to the safety and well-being of persons (employees, citizens or customers), property or the organization. 
4.  The completion of time cards provides documentation and justification of salary expense of public employees as well as the use of authorized leave programs. Therefore, the completion of time cards to note the use of the city/BLW authorized leave programs, or other indicators of the use of public employees' time does not controvert an employee's exempt or salaried status. 
5.  Department heads may require employees to receive compensatory time, instead of overtime pay, at a rate of one and one-half times the number of hours worked in excess of 40 hours for general employees, 56 hours for firefighters and 43 hours for police officers. Firefighters will receive overtime pay for the hours worked in excess of 159, but less than 169 hours in a three-week work cycle. 
6.  General employees eligible for overtime compensation may accumulate a maximum of 240 compensatory hours. Police and firefighting personnel may accumulate a maximum of 480 compensatory hours. Employees who are eligible for overtime compensation who have attained the maximum compensatory time shall be paid overtime pay for all hours worked in excess of their standard work-week. Department heads or their designees may require nonexempt employees to utilize their accruals of compensatory time prior to other leave programs except if such requirement will result in an employee forfeiting an equivalent accrual balance in those leave programs within the next three months of such requirement of the employee to use compensatory time. 
7.  All employees who are eligible for overtime compensation shall be paid all accumulated balances of compensatory time upon termination of employment. 
8.  Exempt personnel including, department heads, administrative and managerial employees who are authorized in writing to work more hours than the standard work period established for their position may accumulate compensatory time at the rate of one times the number of hours worked in excess of their standard workweek. There will be a maximum accumulation of 120 hours at any time during a calendar year. All compensatory time earned in any calendar year must either be utilized by March 31 of the following calendar year or forfeited. Any compensatory time balances attributed to exempt personnel as of September 29, 1990, may be retained. If an exempt employee terminates their service with the city, any remaining balance of compensatory time earned prior to September 30, 1990, and certified as correct by the employee's supervisor and the human resources director shall be paid upon termination. No compensatory time earned on or after September 30, 1990, will be paid to exempt personnel at any time including, but not limited to termination of employment or upon forfeiture. The completion of time cards to include compensatory time accruals and usage provides documentation and justification of salary expense of public employees. Therefore, the completion of time cards to note the use of the city/BLW authorized leave programs including compensatory time, or other indicators of the use of public employees' time does not controvert an employee's exempt or salaried status. 
9.  Improper FLSA deductions prohibited. The City/BLW prohibits improper pay deductions as outlined in the FLSA, as amended and the pertinent regulations thereto. The mechanism for employees to make a complaint regarding their exemption status is described in City Code Section 4-4-24-050. Employees are to utilize City Code Section 4-4-22 for all other wage and hour complaints. Should the city/BLW be determined to have made an improper pay deduction, the employee will be reimbursed the amount of such deduction in the first pay period following such determination. The city/BLW will abide by any new or revised process or determination in order to comply with the FLSA in the future following any correction of an inadvertent improper pay deduction. 
B.  Emergency Call-Out Pay. 
1.  If an employee, who is eligible for overtime, is officially ordered to and does report for duty of an unscheduled nature, he shall be compensated for a minimum of two and one-half hours at one and one-half times the regular rate of pay. Half an hour of the two and one-half hour minimum callback compensation is for travel time for an employee who is called back on the job and who does not have a city vehicle at his home in which to respond to the call. In the event that the employee does have a city vehicle at his home in which to respond to the call, then such employee shall only be entitled to a minimum of two hours' call-back compensation at one and one-half times the regular rate of pay. 
2.  For the purpose of this policy, an employee shall be credited with hours worked from the time the employee is notified by the dispatcher until the work is completed and the employee is no longer restricted from using their time for their own pursuits. It is required that the employee report promptly to the required job site. The employee's regularly defined workday, as established by individual departments, shall be used to define a 24-hour work period in determining callback pay. Before returning home from an emergency call-out, the employee is required to check with the dispatcher for other calls and if none, notify the dispatcher that he is going off duty or other appropriate status. 
3.  Nonemergency Call-Out Pay. If an employee, who is eligible for overtime, is required to and does report back to work at a predesignated time, he will receive a minimum of one hour credited to their work period. 
C.  Merit Increases. 
1.  An employee's job performance shall be evaluated annually on the anniversary of their most recent hire date. If the council has approved an annual merit increase in the current budget, and the employee has received a rating of meets requirements or higher on their last annual evaluation, the employee will be eligible to receive the approved merit increase. Part-time employees, apprentice line workers, line workers, appointed employees, interns, and contractual employees are not eligible to receive merit increases pursuant to this section. 
2.  An employee who has reached the maximum of his pay grade, may not exceed the pay grade maximum. 
3.  Apprenticeship/Career Development Program, Appointed and Contract Employees. All appointed and contract employees will be reviewed annually as designated by the city council and may be awarded a performance increase at the discretion of the city council. In consideration of participation in a formal apprenticeship or career development program, such employees will be reviewed at least once annually and may be granted increases in compensation as provided by those programs, if funded by the city council/BLW. 
4.  Merit increases are based upon the employee's performance as determined by their supervisor and department head on their annual evaluation. Employees may attach a response to their annual evaluation to be included in the personnel file, but annual evaluations may not be grieved past Step 2 of the city/BLW grievance procedure contained in Section 2-2-22-030. 
D.  Service Award. 
1.  Employees who have completed at least five years of service with the city and who have received at least a satisfactory annual evaluation as determined by their department head are eligible for service bonus award. If the employee did not receive at least a satisfactory evaluation, the employee will not be eligible for the service bonus for that year. Eligibility will be restored upon the next satisfactory annual evaluation coincident with their employment anniversary date. 
2.  The amount of the service bonus will be apportioned by five-year increments up to a maximum of 25 years. The dollar amount allocated for each five-year increment of service by the employee will be determined as part of the pay plan approved annually by the city council. 
3.  All service bonus awards will be distributed in a block amount on the scheduled pay period immediately following the employee's employment anniversary date. 
E.  Working Out of Classification. 
1.  An employee who is designated by their department head as working out of classification will be compensated at five percent above their regular rate of pay for each day so designated. An employee must work out of class at least two full consecutive days or a 24-hour period for firefighters to be eligible for out of classification pay. Eligible employees will be compensated for each day worked out of their normal classification. No out of class pay will be paid to employees required to act in an equal or lower classification as determined by pay grade. 
2.  Employees who work out of classification for 30 days or more are to be compensated at the minimum rate of the assigned higher class or five percent above their regular rate of pay, whichever is greater. In special circumstances, the department head can recommend adding an additional five percent to the figure through the director of human resources and risk management with approval of the city manager. 
F.  Required Court Appearance. Employees required to testify or give a deposition on behalf of the city/BLW or because of conduct arising out of and in the course of employment with the city/BLW in response to a legally valid subpoena, shall be paid for all hours required in court, but will receive a minimum of two hours' credited to his regular work period if any court required appearances occur during the employee's off duty hours unless the required court appearance is immediately before or immediately after the employee's regular workday in which case such time will be added to the employee's actual hours worked for the pay period. Any witness or other fees that the employee receives for this service shall be endorsed and promptly transmitted by the employee to his department head for forwarding to the finance department. 
G.  Police Shift Differential Pay. 
1.  Police officers and full-time civilian transport officers who work the hours of 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m., will earn an additional $0.50 per hour for increased risks and hazards in their occupation. 
2.  Police officers and full-time civilian transport officers who work the hours of 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. will earn an additional $1.00 per hour for increased risks and hazards of their occupation. 
3.  A maximum of eight hours' shift differential pay may be earned in a 24-hour period. 
4.  Assignment to a shift shall not vest a police officer or full-time civilian transport officer with a vested right to work a particular shift or to receive shift differential pay if reassigned to a different shift. This section may be modified or deleted at any time by the city council. 
H.  Standby Pay. 
1.  Employees placed on standby status are those directed to be available by telephone, pager, beeper, police radio or other means of communication so that they are available for and capable of reporting for work within a reasonable period of time. Department heads shall designate the positions and eligible employees for standby status as needed and in writing. 
2.  Employees who are on standby and fail to respond to a call for duty shall forfeit all standby pay for the assigned period and may be subject to disciplinary action. 
3.  Compensation for an employee serving standby duty will be at a rate of eight hours of pay at their regular rate for one week of standby duty served. Such hours shall be paid at the normal rate of pay (straight time). Exempt employees will be compensated at the rate of eight hours' compensatory leave for one week of standby duty served. Standby time of less than seven days shall be credited on a proportionate basis. 
4.  In the event a non-exempt employee is called back to duty while on standby status, the employee shall receive compensation for actual hours worked at one and one-half times their normal rate of pay. If exempt personnel are called back to duty while on standby status, those individuals shall accrue compensatory time as provided in Section 4-4-28-090 of this article. 
5.  Police Department Restricted Standby for Court Compensation. Compensation for police department personnel regarding court attendance will be in accordance with the FLSA. The department will develop and update procedures as necessary to carry out this purpose.

ARTICLE 4-4-26 - ALCOHOL AND CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE POLICY AND PROCEDURAL GUIDE 

4-4-26-010 - Policy. 
A.  It is the position of the city/BLW that alcohol and controlled substance abuse is the number one health problem in the United States today. The costs involved with this problem include human costs such as lost jobs, morale problems, injuries, illnesses, deaths, as well as economic costs such as property damage, absenteeism, tardiness, lost productivity, increased health insurance costs, and the costs involved in replacing and retraining new employees. 
B.  The use of alcohol or controlled substances by city/BLW employees while on the job constitutes a direct threat to property and the safety of others. The work involved in many positions is inherently dangerous, and the safety of citizens and employees depends upon the ability of fellow employees to think clearly with unimpaired faculties. 
C.  It is the objective of the city/BLW to provide safe and effective public service. To meet this objective, the problem of alcohol and controlled substance abuse must be identified, confronted and defeated. In order to achieve this, the city/BLW has developed a comprehensive alcohol and controlled substance policy. This policy consists of three interrelated programs: 
1.  An employee education/supervisor training program; 
2.  An employee referral system for assessment/treatment; 
3.  An alcohol and controlled substance testing program. 
The responsibility for this policy lies with the city/BLW department heads with the human resources department serving as expert advisor and training coordinator. 
D.  The city/BLW considers its employees to be its most valuable resource and sincerely wishes to assist its employees with any alcohol or controlled substance related problems they might have. As used in this policy the term "controlled substance" shall have the meaning and include the substances defined as "controlled substances" in the Georgia Controlled Substances Act, O.C.G.A. § 16-13-20 et seq., and especially O.C.G.A. § 16-12-21(4) as said section and said act shall appear from time to time. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1161; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1) 
4-4-26-015 - Definitions. 
A.  Under the Influence. For the purpose of this policy, being "under the influence" means that the employee is affected by a drug(s) or alcohol or the combination of a drug and alcohol in any detectable manner exceeding the measurable benchmarks determined by the testing process authorized herein. The symptoms of influence are not confined to those consistent with misconduct, nor to any obvious impairment of physical or mental ability, such as slurred speech or difficulty in maintaining balance. 
B.  Illegal Drug. "Illegal drug" means any drug (a) not legally obtainable or (b) legally obtainable but not legally obtained or used. The term includes prescription drugs obtained illegally and prescription drugs not being used for prescribed purposes including but not limited to those prescribed for other persons. "Controlled substances" mean those listed in Schedules I through V of Section 202 of the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. 812) and as further defined in regulation 21 CFR 1308.11-1308.15. 
C.  Reasonable Suspicion. A belief based on observed, specific, objective facts where the rational inference to be drawn under the circumstances is that the person is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. 
D.  Safety Sensitive Positions/Duties. Any job that contains any duty regularly and routinely performed that is related to 1) the safe operation of city/BLW motorized equipment and vehicles, 2) the care, custody or interaction with children or the elderly in the course of their assigned responsibilities; and 3) any job or assigned task that involves the handling of hazardous materials, including, but not limited to medications, pesticides/herbicides, cleaning fluids, pool maintenance chemicals, etc. These tasks become safety sensitive during any period in which the city/BLW employee is actually performing, ready to perform or immediately available to perform the above functions. 
(Ord. No. 7043, 5/9/2007, § 6) 
4-4-26-020 - Prohibited acts. 
A.  The use or possession of alcohol or any controlled substance while on work time or work premises shall be prohibited. 
B.  The sale, distribution or provision of alcohol or any controlled substance while on work time or work premises shall be prohibited. 
C.  Reporting to work, or working, while intoxicated or otherwise impaired by alcohol or controlled substance use shall be prohibited. 
D.  Alcohol or controlled substance related off duty conduct that tends to undermine the reputation, authority or efficiency of the city/BLW is prohibited. 
E.  The use or possession of prescription drugs while on work premises, or while working, shall be prohibited, unless; 
1.  The prescribing physician has been notified of the duties involved with the employee's position and has approved the use of the drug while that employee is performing those duties. It is the duty of the employee to notify the physician of the specific tasks of the position and the mental and physical demands required in the performance of those duties. Further, the city/BLW reserves the right to clarify those duties and the mental and physical demands required to perform those tasks to the physician; and 
2.  The employee's supervisor has been notified in writing by the employee that he is using a prescription drug and that the employee's physician has approved the use of the drug while the employee is at work. Identification of a physician authorized prescription drug to the supervisor is not required. 
It should be noted that certain departments may have more restrictive regulation of prescription or over the counter medication than as provided herein. Employees are to be informed of such departmental policy upon initial orientation. 
F.  Any employee convicted of violating a criminal drug statute must inform his department head of such conviction (including pleas of guilty and nolo contendere) within five days of the conviction occurring. Failure to so inform the employer subjects the employee to disciplinary action up to and including termination for the first offense. By law, the city/BLW must notify any federal contracting officer within ten days of receiving such notice from an employee or other receiving notice of such a conviction. 
G.  The adulteration of any sample provided or disruption of any city/BLW authorized drug/alcohol testing process shall be prohibited.

(Code 1978, § 4-1163; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 6905, 4/12/2006, § 1; Ord. No. 7043, 5/9/2007, § 8; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1) 
4-4-26-040 - Procedural guide for violations. 
If in the opinion of the supervisor, a reasonable suspicion exists that the employee is reporting to work, or is working, while under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances, or while impaired from the use of same, the procedures outlined below shall be followed. Please note that for the purposes of this policy the term "reasonable suspicion" shall be based on objective indications of substance abuse. 
A.  Procedures for Impairment Violations. 
1.  The supervisor shall arrange, if possible, for at least one other supervisor to observe the conduct of the employee. The observing supervisor shall make a written report of the incident, including the "supervisor's observation checklists" form which includes a description of the conduct of the employee upon which such reasonable suspicion is based. 
2.  If the employee fails to explain his condition to the satisfaction of the employee's supervisor, an alcohol and/or controlled substance screening test shall be administered to the suspected employee. The employee will be driven by the supervisor or other designated official to the city designated testing facility. Refusal to submit to such tests shall constitute insubordination and shall be a sufficient ground for termination. The employee will be suspended with pay pending the results of the alcohol and/or controlled substance screening test. Tests for alcohol impairment may be administered by the use of the device known as Intox 5000 or any other similar device approved for use by the director of the state crime lab. 
3.  The supervisor should make the necessary arrangements to have the employee taken home. If the employee refuses any assistance, at least two supervisory personnel can verify that the employee refused such assistance. However, if an employee cannot control his actions and refuses assistance, then the police department shall be called to warn them of the employee's condition and refusal of assistance before the employee is allowed to leave the work site. The police department shall be given the employee's name and description of the employee's car. The reason for this action is for the safety of the employee and the general public. The city/BLW has a duty to take such action as a reasonably prudent employer to prevent the employee from causing an unreasonable risk of harm to himself and others. 
4.  If the confirmed results of such tests indicate the presence of alcohol or any illegal controlled substance in the system of the employee, it will be presumed that the employee is impaired. The presumption of impairment will result in the suspension with pay pending discharge investigation of the employee pursuant to procedures set forth in Article 4-4-20 of these rules and regulations. 
5.  During the period the employee is suspended with pay, an investigation shall take place. This investigation will be completed within five eight-hour work days (Saturday, Sunday and holidays excluded) unless extended by the human resources director. During this investigation, the employee may through his own effort attempt to rebut the presumption of impairment. For example, the employee may submit to a blood test within three hours of the city/BLW-administered test for the presence of alcohol or controlled substances. If such blood test produces a negative result, the presumption of impairment may be considered rebutted, depending upon such factors as the timing of the blood test and other circumstances surrounding the impairment. 
6.  If after the investigation is completed, and if it has been determined that a violation of the alcohol and controlled substance policy has occurred, it shall be within the discretion of the supervisory personnel to: 
a.  Discipline up to and including termination of the employee following the procedural guidelines set forth in Article 4-4-20 of these rules and regulations; or 
b.  Coordinate with the human resources department to refer the employee for a rehabilitation assessment, at the city's expense to determine if there is a significant chance that the employee can be rehabilitated. This option is only available if the employee has not committed an act or omission which presented an immediate danger to the public, himself or other employees or if he has not committed any felony or a misdemeanor related to his job or acts or omissions which could reasonably impact his ability to do his job effectively. The employee permitted to utilize this option will be required to sign an agreement accepting the conditions of the rehabilitation program in order to maintain an employment relationship with the city. Any conditions of the rehabilitation program must have been previously approved by the human resources director and the employee's department head. If such conditions are unacceptable to the employee, the provisions of Subsection (6)(a) shall apply. This referral would be the employee's "last chance." After successful completion of an alcohol and/or controlled substance program, at the employee's expense, the employee may return to work subject to random alcohol and controlled substance screening tests for a minimum period of 36 months. If at any time during this "last chance" testing period, a screening test indicates the presence of alcohol or any controlled substance in the employee's system, the employee shall be immediately terminated after following the procedural guidelines set forth in the Disciplinary Action Policy and Procedure in Article 4-4-20 of these rules and regulations. Any subsequent relapse after 36 months will be handled as in Subsection (6)(a) above. 
B.  Procedures for the Sale, Distribution or Provision of Alcohol/controlled Substances While at Work Violations. Violations of Section 4-4-26-020(b) will ordinarily result in termination consistent with the procedural guidelines set forth in Article 4-4-20 of these rules and regulations. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1164; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7043, 5/9/2007, § 9; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1) 
4-4-26-050 - Confidentiality. 
At all times during an investigation of violations of the alcohol and controlled substances policy, reasonable steps will be taken to maintain the confidentiality of the case. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1165; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96) 
4-4-26-060 - Awareness program. 
The basic idea behind this program is that employee alcohol/controlled substance abuse can be prevented by supplying employees with information about the problems alcohol/controlled substances can create. The awareness program is divided into two sections, an employee education section to include all city employees and a supervisory training section. 
A.  Employee Education, Generally. The human resources department with assistance from the Marietta police and fire departments will provide educational seminars at least once annually. These seminars may include questionnaires at both the start and completion of the program (to chart any belief/knowledge changes); audiovisual programs; group discussions; a presentation of what a treatment program is, what it does, and how to take advantage of one; insurance coverage for treatment (if any); and a description and discussion of the city/BLW's alcohol and controlled substances policy. 
B.  Employee Education for Holders of Commercial Drivers' Licenses. All new hires required to possess and maintain a commercial driver's license (CDL), and current employees transferring to positions requiring them to obtain a CDL, will be given a handbook entitled, "Drug Abuse and Alcohol Misuse Training Guide for CDL Drivers", which will include: 
1.  The identity of the person designated to answer questions about the materials. 
2.  The categories of drivers who are subject to the provisions of 49 CFR, Part 382. 
3.  Sufficient information about safety sensitive functions performed by those drivers to make clear what period of the work day the driver is required to be in compliance. 
4.  Specific information concerning driver conduct that is prohibited. 
5.  The circumstances under which a driver will be tested for alcohol and/or controlled substances. 
6.  The procedures that will be used to test for the presence of alcohol and controlled substances, protect the driver and the integrity of the testing process, safeguard the validity of the test results and ensure that those results are attributed to the correct driver. 
7.  The requirement that a driver submit to alcohol and controlled substances tests. 
8.  An explanation of what constitutes a refusal to submit to an alcohol or controlled substances test. 
9.  The consequence for drivers found to have an alcohol concentration of .02 or greater, but less than .04. 
10.  Information concerning the effect of alcohol and controlled substances use on an individual's health, work and personal life; signs and symptoms of an alcohol or a controlled substances problem; and available methods of intervening when an alcohol or controlled substances problem is suspected, including confrontation, referral programs and/or referral to management for disciplinary action. 
C.  Supervisory Training. The human resources department with assistance from the Marietta police and fire departments will provide training to supervisors on the important role supervisors have in preventing alcohol/controlled substance abuse. The program may include instruction in identifying warning signs of alcohol/ controlled substance abuse by employees; role playing scenarios of what to do if an employee is suspected; group discussions; and a thorough presentation of the alcohol and controlled substances policy. Supervisory personnel designated to determine whether an employee should be required to submit to a controlled substance or alcohol reasonable suspicion test, shall receive an initial 60 minutes of training on controlled substance use, and 60 minutes of training on alcohol use, which will include the physical, behavioral, speech and performance indicators of probable use of controlled substances and alcohol. 
D.  The city/BLW recognizes that alcohol/drug abuse and/or dependency are medical/behavioral conditions that can be successfully treated. Employees with alcohol/drug problems are encouraged to voluntarily request assistance from the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Participation in an EAP is totally voluntary and completely confidential; however a request for assistance or actual participation in an EAP does not excuse an employee from violation of this policy. The only exception to the EAP confidentiality provision occurs when an employee is referred to the EAP by city/BLW authorized management personnel. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1166; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7043, 5/9/2007, § 10; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1) 
4-4-26-070 - Referral for rehabilitation. 
A.  The alcohol and controlled substance policy allows a supervisor to refer an employee for assessment and rehabilitation as an option other than termination for a violation of this policy. However, this option is only available if the employee has not committed an act or omission which presented an immediate danger to the public, himself or other employees or if he has not committed any felony or a misdemeanor related to his job or acts or omissions which could reasonably impact his ability to do his job effectively. 
B.  All referrals will be coordinated through the city/BLW human resources department. Factors to take into account when this decision is made include: 
1.  The employee's length of service; 
2.  The employee's position and performance in that position prior to and during impairment; 
3.  The severity of the policy violation; 
4.  The publicity concerning the violation including the loss of credibility or believability of an employee who exercises discretionary judgment in the duties of his position; 
5.  Whether the violation involved substance dependence or an incident(s) motivated by reasons other than substance dependence (for example, the sale of drugs to other employees). 
C.  After a decision to refer the employee for rehabilitation has been made, the employee will be counseled by the department head and a representative of the human resources department. At this counseling session, the policy shall be reviewed with the employee, the employee shall sign the "employee consent and referral" form. It must be made clear to the employee at this time that the referral is his last chance, and that he must make the firm choice between rehabilitation or termination. 
D.  If an employee must take time off to take part in a rehabilitation program, the absence will be treated as sick leave. 
E.  Upon returning to work, the employee will be subject to unannounced alcohol/controlled substance screening tests for a minimum period of 36 months, with an emphasis on post-weekend (Mondays) testing or after vacations. However, a fixed schedule will not be established. Unless circumstances clearly require more frequent testing, there shall be no more than one screening test per month. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1167; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7043, 5/9/2007, § 11; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1) 
4-4-26-080 - Screening test program. 
A.  Testing Quality and Techniques to be Utilized. 
1.  The city/BLW will establish a professional relationship with a professional laboratory which shall comply with all current National Institute of Drug Abuse standards. An assessment of the laboratory will be performed which will include a review of how samples are actually tested; all procedures involved (chain of custody of sample, notation of time and place sample was taken, the amount of turn around time that will elapse before a result is reached, etc.); qualifications of the laboratory personnel; and a check of the internal quality control records of the laboratory. 
2.  All samples will be collected at the laboratory, hospital or other city designated testing facility including but not limited to any law enforcement agency that has an Intox 5000 or similar device. The samples will be carefully checked and marked with the name of the employee, the date and time the sample was collected, and the location where the sample was collected. A chain of custody/control will be established so that samples are properly handled before testing occurs. Every effort must be made to assure that the sample being tested is the sample actually collected from the employee/applicant in question. 
3.  When testing for alcohol, a breathalyzer, such as the Intox 5000 or other similar device. Any measurable amount of alcohol found will be sufficient for a presumption of impairment, unless such measurement is the result of consumption of alcohol or an alcohol related product that is prescribed by a licensed physician. Some departments may require more restrictive standards than described herein. The employee has the right to request a blood test if he so desires. This test will be at the employee's expense. 
4.  The city/BLW will use urine samples for controlled substance testing even though the presence of foreign metabolites in urine does not necessarily indicate impairment, but rather recent exposure to the substance. However, alternatives such as blood tests and hair analysis may be interpreted as more intrusive, but may be used if necessary. 
5.  The city/BLW will utilize the testing standards of the department of transportation regulations as provided in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended and as may be hereafter amended. The following is a brief outline of the methods to be used. The city/BLW will utilize the technique known as immunoassay technique of chemical testing. The immunoassay technique has a high degree of reliability under "optimal" conditions. However, all positive immunoassay tests on current employees shall be confirmed by another more elaborate and thorough test method. Confirmatory methods include any one of the following techniques: thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. All positive immunoassay tests on samples from applicants will be confirmed with a repeat administration of the immunoassay technique on the sample. 
B.  Testing Procedure. The alcohol and controlled substance policy provides for testing in six different situations: the preemployment or promotion/demotion/transfer screen; the screen as part of any required annual physical examination; the "reasonable suspicion" screen; post accident screen; random test program for safety sensitive positions and drivers of city/BLW vehicles; and random test program after return to work after an alcohol and/or controlled substance policy violation. 
1.  Post Employment Offer or Promotion/Demotion/Transfer Screen. 
a.  After an employment offer has been made to a prospective employee, but before employment has begun or any employee who has applied for and is offered a safety sensitive position, a position requiring driving of a city/BLW vehicle or any other position with the city/BLW not prohibited by law, will be sent to the human resources department and scheduled for a post employment offer alcohol and controlled substance test. The applicant when sent to the testing facility will be asked to sign consent and notice form. Job candidate applicants, including current employees, are required to provide truthful statements to the questions asked. Any false statements provided will result in rescission of the employment offer and in the case of current employees, could result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. 
b.  Should the applicant refuse to sign the consent form, the application process will continue. On the application it will be noted only that the applicant "refused screen". It will not mention suspected alcohol or drug use by the applicant. The applicant has a right to refuse to consent to the test, but the city/BLW has a parallel right to refuse to hire/promote/transfer/voluntarily demote the applicant. However, should an inquiry as to that specific application be made by the applicant or a third party at a later date, the city will protect the confidentiality of the application process. For instance, if another employer contacts the city/BLW in the context of a reference check, the only information that will be supplied is that the applicant did apply and that the applicant "failed to meet the qualifications necessary for employment". It will never be revealed that the applicant refused to consent to an alcohol/controlled substances screen unless required to defend, answer and/or litigate a suit or through some other legal action. 
c.  If the applicant being considered for the position has consented to the test and the test results are negative, the applicant will continue with the hiring process. However, should the test results come back positive, the test must be confirmed utilizing the same sample originally provided. 
d.  All test results are confidential except as provided herein. If a preemployment test is confirmed a positive result, all inquiries as to why the applicant who is not a current city/BLW employee, was not hired will be answered by stating, "the applicant failed to meet the qualifications necessary for the position". However, the city/BLW reserves the right to notify the current department head of any employee who tests positive on any alcohol/drug screen conducted as a part of any application process for another position within the city/BLW organization. All applicants with a confirmed positive result may reapply at a later date at which time he/she will submit to another alcohol/controlled substance screening test. 
2.  Medical Examination Screen. 
a.  At the time the employee is to undergo a required medical examination, the alcohol and controlled substance policy should be explained to the employee and he/she will sign the "employee consent and notice" form at the testing facility. Alcohol testing may be performed by the use of the standard breathalyzer, Intox 5000 or any similar device approved by the state crime lab director at a city designated testing facility including, but not limited to, any law enforcement agency that has such equipment. 
b.  Should the employee refuse to sign the consent form, the medical examination will proceed. After the examination has been completed, the employee will be suspended with pay, following the procedure set forth in Article 4-4-20 of these rules and regulations. The employee may be terminated for "insubordination", pursuant to the procedure set forth in Article 4-4-20 of these rules and regulations. The stated reason for terminating an employee will never be "refusal to submit to urinalysis", but rather "insubordination" or "failure to follow the legitimate instructions of supervisors", or other reason listed in Article 4-4-20. 
c.  If the employee consents to the test and the test results are negative, the employee can return to work if he has passed the rest of the medical examination. However, should the test results indicate the presence of alcohol or controlled substances, that test result must and will be confirmed by one of the more specific confirmatory tests cited above utilizing the same sample originally provided. If the confirmatory test also indicates the presence of alcohol/controlled substances, the employee will be assumed to be impaired, and may be suspended with pay pending investigation for discharge, in accordance with the alcohol and controlled substance policy and Article 4-4-20 of this chapter. 
d.  During the period of suspension, an intensive investigation into the employee's employment background and the circumstances behind the alleged policy violation will take place. After the investigation is completed, and there is sufficient cause to believe that a policy violation has occurred, the employee will be either: 
(1)  Disciplined up to and including termination; or 
(2)  Referred for assessment/treatment by his department head. 
e.  If after the investigation has been completed it is determined that a policy violation has not occurred (for example, if the employee successfully rebuts the assumption of impairment by submitting to a blood test within three hours after the original test, and the results of which are negative), the employee will be reinstated to his former position. 
3.  "Reasonable Suspicion" Screen. 
a.  The screen upon reasonable suspicion involves a great deal of discretion on the part of supervisory personnel. The supervisory training program will provide precise guidelines as to what is involved with identifying a potential alcohol or controlled substance abuser. The task of identifying potential abusers does not include diagnosing a worker. The fact that a problem exists is all that is to be discussed when dealing with an employee; that is, demonstrated employee behavior. It is not the position of the supervisor to act in the role of a diagnostician. When it is suspected that an employee has violated the alcohol and controlled substance policy, the employee will only be told that job-related problems have developed and that it is suspected that these job-related problems are the result of alcohol and/or controlled substance abuse. The underlying cause of such abuse should not be a concern of the supervisor. 
b.  The phrase "reasonable suspicion" means that a screening test should be administered if it is reasonable to suspect that an employee has violated this policy. 
c.  A "suspicion" must be based upon objective indications of substance abuse or other policy violations. Therefore, forms have been developed to provide guidance to supervisors in assessing whether a "reasonable suspicion" exists as well as providing documentation of the basis of a decision to require an alcohol or controlled substance test. Thorough documentation of all steps of an investigation for a possible violation of this policy is a must including the date and time of any discussion with the employee. For further information, see Section 4-4-26-040 above, procedural guide for violations. 
4.  Post Accident Screen. After an on-the-job accident involving injury to the employee or others or property damage, the department head, with approval of the human resources director, may require testing for alcohol and/or controlled substances. 
5.  Random Testing for Safety Sensitive Positions. The random testing program shall include all employees who 1) perform safety sensitive functions (see Section 4-4-26-015(D) above) which shall include but is not limited to those employees who regularly drive a city/BLW vehicle as part of the required duties of their position; or 2) are required by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), 49 CFR, Part 382, to maintain a commercial driver's license. Employees in safety sensitive positions as described above are subject to random alcohol and controlled substance testing at an annual percentage for the calendar year as prescribed by the Federal Highway Administration for all CDL holders. The tests will be unannounced and will be reasonably spaced throughout the year. Drivers chosen for a random test must proceed immediately upon notification of the random test to the designated test site. 
6.  Return to Duty After Policy Violation. If an employee has been relieved of duty for a prohibited use of alcohol or controlled substances, that employee shall undergo an alcohol and controlled substance test before returning to work, if permitted to do so. The results of such test must be negative. If an employee is returned to duty, the employee is required to comply with the conditions of a rehabilitation program, such employee shall be subject up to nine unannounced tests in the first 12 months after their return and up to 18 unannounced tests in the 36 months following return to duty. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1168; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 6905, 4/12/2006, § 2; Ord. No. 7043, 5/9/2007, § 12; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1) 
4-4-26-090 - Disciplinary actions. 
A.  The suspension or termination of an employee will never be justified on the basis that the employee is an alcoholic or substance abuser. Instead, discipline will center around the employee's failure to meet objective, job-related criteria. "Substandard performance," "insubordination," "violation of policy," or "failure to follow orders," "under the influence of alcohol while on duty" are examples of proper reasons for discipline. 
B.  Discriminatory enforcement will not be tolerated and any supervisor exhibiting such behavior will be disciplined accordingly. 
C.  The employee cannot be terminated unless the procedures set forth in Article 4-4-20 are followed. 
D.  After disciplinary proceedings have taken place, inquiries as to the reason for termination/suspension will be answered by the statement of the actual rule violations only.

No. 7061, adopted June 13, 2007; and Ord. No. 7113, adopted Nov. 19, 2007. 

4-4-28-010 - Purpose. 
Performance evaluation is considered a key element in the management of human resources. It is the process of identifying and communicating organizational requirements, then measuring and developing the employee's performance. The primary purpose of performance evaluation is to provide an opportunity for feedback. Performance evaluations may be used to facilitate management decisions regarding compensation, training and development. It is of the utmost importance that the performance evaluation system be consistent, job related, and based on clear and objective criteria. 
1.  A performance evaluation system should be formalized, standardized, objective and not biased against race, color, sex, religion, or national origin. 
2.  Performance measurements must be job-related and based on critical elements specific to the job. 
3.  Evaluators mast be trained and have substantial daily contact with the employee evaluated. 
4.  Administration and scoring of the performance evaluation must be standardized and controlled. 
(Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 13) 
4-4-28-020 - Types of evaluations. 
1.  Annual Evaluations. Pursuant to Section 2-2-24-120, employees will be evaluated annually on the anniversary of their most recent hire date for purposes of determining eligibility for merit increases. If the employee receives a rating of satisfactory or higher on their last annual evaluation they will be eligible to receive any council approved merit increase. Merit increases do not apply to part-time employees, appointed employees, employees in the apprentice line worker and line work program, interns or contractual employees. 
2.  Working Test Period Evaluations. Employees are placed in a working test status upon hire by the city/BLW and when promoted, demoted or transferred. A working test period evaluation must be completed at the end of the employee's working test period indicating successful completion of that process. If an employee's working test period is extended, an additional evaluation will be completed prior to the employee being assigned regular status. 
3.  Other Evaluations. A performance evaluation may be performed when an employee's performance has substantially declined or in connection with a disciplinary action when approved in advance by the department head and human resources director. 
(Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 13) 
4-4-28-030 - Supervisory responsibilities. 
An employee's supervisor is required to prepare an employee's evaluation then meet, review and discuss the evaluation with the employee. After the review, the employee should be asked to sign the evaluation to indicate that he has read and understood the evaluation and has had an opportunity to discuss any question he might have with his supervisor. The employee's signature does not necessarily mean he agrees with the evaluation, just that he has had the opportunity to meet and discuss the evaluation with his supervisor. 
Failure to complete an employee's evaluation timely or failure to responsibly communicate the contents of an evaluation to employees will result in lower evaluation scores on the supervisor's annual evaluation. 
(Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 13) 
ARTICLE 4-4-30 - SAFETY AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION POLICY 

4-4-30-010 - Safety policy. 
It is the policy of the city/BLW that every employee is entitled to work under the safest possible conditions in the various positions of the city. To this end, every reasonable effort will be made to provide and maintain a safe and healthy workplace, safe equipment, proper materials to work with and to establish and enforce safe work methods and practices at all times. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1211; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96) 
4-4-30-020 - On-the-job injuries. 
A.  The purpose of this section is to provide city/BLW employees with fair and equitable workers' compensation benefits as defined under the State of Georgia Workers' Compensation Act. 
B.  This policy applies to all employees on city/BLW payroll and excludes all contracted services. 
C.  Responsibilities. 
1.  Employee. When injured or ill due to an on-the-job incident, notify his supervisor of the injury or illness immediately, to keep their supervisor informed of required absences and to follow the instructions of the treating physician. 
2.  Supervisor. To provide proper safety training and supervision of job skills so that accidents may not occur and to ensure that injured or ill employees that are involved in on-the-job accidents receive proper medical or first aid treatment as soon as possible. 
3.  Department Heads or Their Designee. To make authorization and/or approvals for treatment of injured or ill employees; ensure proper follow-up of accident investigations; ensure that absences of the employee are properly excused; and that the proper payment is made to the employee, if any, under any leave policy while absent due to an on-the-job injury or illness. The department head will ensure that the human resources department is informed within 24 hours of any on-the-job injury or illness or by 5:00 p.m. on Monday following an incident occurring over the previous weekend and of any absence of the employee due to such injury or illness. 
4.  Human Resources Department. This department will coordinate and administer the city/BLW workers' compensation program and fund. 
D.  Treatment of Injured Employees. 
1.  A supervisor or department head may administer minor first aid treatment for scratches, minor cuts or scrapes only. 
2.  Injuries or illnesses requiring physician treatment: 
a.  All occupational injuries or illnesses which require physician treatment are to be referred to one of the physicians or physician groups listed on the workers' compensation approved panel of physicians that are posted on all employee bulletin boards. Department heads or their designee will issue an authorization to treat the employee to give to the designated physician. A copy of such authorization will be sent to the human resources department. If none of the posted physicians or physician groups are available, the employee is to be treated at the nearest urgent care facility (such as Wellstar, etc.) or if necessary, the nearest hospital emergency room. 
b.  All emergency on-the-job accident victims shall be transported to the emergency room of a licensed hospital. Supervisors must have approval from their department head to personally transport or delegate an employee to transport job-related injured or ill employees to the hospital emergency room. In cases of severe injuries or illnesses, the supervisor or their designee will immediately call 911 for immediate treatment and transport to the hospital. However, as soon as possible after the employee is transported to the hospital, the supervisor should notify his department head. 
c.  The human resources department will be responsible for review of bills received for treatment, and submitted to the city's workers' compensation administrator for approval and payment. The city will only be responsible for those medical expenses authorized by the department head, the department of human resources or medical emergency treatment at a licensed hospital or urgent care facility for job-related injuries or illnesses. If a claim for workers' compensation benefits is subsequently denied due to fraud, violation of safety rules, or other legitimate reasons, incurred expenses may be the responsibility of the employee. 
d.  Employees injured on the job have the right to a one-time change of their initial treating physician to another physician on the workers' compensation panel. Employees shall inform the human resources department in writing of any change in treating physicians. 
e.  Prescription drugs/medical supplies authorized for treatment of on-the-job injuries. Employees may choose between the following options for filling prescribed drugs and obtaining medical supplies. 
(1)  The employee may go to one of the pharmacies or medical supply businesses that the city/BLW has arranged to be invoiced for workers' compensation-related charges. The employee will need to show the pharmacist an authorization to invoice the city/BLW that is on the bottom of the "authorization to treat" form as well as proper identification that the person to whom the pharmacist is giving the prescription drugs to is the injured employee or their authorized representative. Only the prescription drugs and medical supplies authorized by the treating physician shall be charged and paid for by the city/BLW. 
(2)  The employee may pay for the prescription drugs and/or medical supplies and submit receipts indicating the prescription number, issuing pharmacy, prescribing physician, date filled, and price to the human resources department for reimbursement. 
E.  Required Reports. 
1.  The employee, or if unavailable, the appropriate supervisor must report all occupational injuries, accidents and illnesses to the department head or his designee by the end of the workday in which an accident, injury or illness occurs. After normal working hours or on weekends, a report must be filed with the department head or his designee by 12:00 noon the following workday. The city/BLW may consider as invalid any on-the-job injury/accident that has not been reported using the required "first report of injury" form and within the above time limits. A "first report of injury" form will be used to report all job-related accidents, injuries or illnesses regardless of the nature or severity. 
2.  It is the employee's responsibility to make sure that the "first report of injury" form states exactly what happened and a clear indication of the type and severity of the injury or illness. If the supervisor or department head disagrees with the employee's explanation, he should so indicate in an attachment memorandum to the "first report of injury" form and provide explanatory detail. However, the report should be submitted to the human resources department with the employee's account of the accident/incident intact. 
3.  Employees are responsible for obtaining excused absence slips from their treating physicians and to provide them to their department head or his designee on a timely basis so that the workers' compensation insurance payments may be promptly processed. The excuse should include an estimated time that will be required to be absent from duty. If light duty is authorized, the physician should include specific restrictions in order to properly assign duties without further injury. If excuses for absences due to on-the-job injury are not received (except for hospital admissions due to on-the-job injuries), then the city/BLW's absenteeism policy will be enforced. 
4.  Employees are also responsible for obtaining authorization to return to work from their treating physician. 
5.  The department head should review and discuss the accident and subsequent injury or illness with the appropriate supervisor to develop safety precautions to help ensure that similar accidents, if preventable, do not recur. 
6.  The department head must file the "first report of injury" form with the human resources department within two eight-hour workdays after the accident, injury or illness occurred or by 5:00 p.m. on the Monday following an incident that occurred over the immediately preceding weekend (including accidents involving employees assigned to shifts). The department head shall notify the human resources department when an employee returns to work after being off due to an on-the-job injury or illness. 
7.  The human resources director and/or risk manager shall consult with the workers' compensation administrator's assigned attorneys on all legal matters regarding liabilities of the city/BLW in relation to workers' compensation. 
F.  Temporary Assignments. 
1.  Occasionally, an employee who has suffered an on-the-job injury is temporarily partially disabled, but is able to perform other productive duties in his department. Department heads should make every effort to return employees to work in some productive capacity from on-the-job injuries as soon as possible. However, if light duty work or appropriate duties within the skill level and physical capability of the employee is not available within their department, the department head should consult with the human resources department for placement of the light duty employee in another department on a temporary basis. If there is still no light duty available, the employee will remain off duty on workers' compensation benefits until he/she is able to return to work without restrictions. 
2.  Employees on light duty work due to an on-the-job injury shall be paid the same rate of pay worked on their regular job. This provision does not apply to any period of partial loss of earnings due to an injury for which a permanent award is paid under the Workers' Compensation Act since such award is intended to compensate the employee for loss of all earnings during the stated period. Any temporary light duty work assignment provided as an accommodation to an on-the-job injury will not constitute working out of the employee's classification for purposes of Section 4-4-28-120. 
G.  Employee Compensation. 
1.  Medical bills: If an employee is injured on the job or becomes ill due to an on-the-job condition or exposure, the employee is eligible for treatment as provided under the State of Georgia Workers' Compensation Act, as amended. 
2.  Salary or wage, first 90 days of loss time due to the approved injury: The employee shall be paid regular straight pay up to 90 calendar days, or 67 eight-hour work days (536 hours) or for fire personnel 751 hours, unless the claim for workers' compensation benefits is controverted by the city/BLW or by the city/BLW's workers' compensation administrator. For approved claims, no deduction will be made from any leave balance credited to the employee. However, the employee is required to endorse the workers' compensation check to the city/BLW. The intent is to provide the employee's normal base salary or wage for the first 90 calendar days of loss time due to the injury, but not any amount greater than the employee would earn if they were working their normal base workweek. 
3.  Salary or wage, after the first 90 days of loss time injury: If the employee remains unable to return to work due to his on-the-job injury or illness after the first 90 days of absence, or 67 eight-hour work days (536 hours) or for fire personnel 751 hours, the employee may choose one of the following options: 
a.  Receive full salary from accrued leave balances and endorse the workers' compensation check to the city/BLW; or 
b.  Receive the worker's compensation check and receive partial salary from leave balances; or 
c.  Accept the worker's compensation check as total compensation. If the workers' compensation check is accepted as total compensation, no time will be deducted from any leave balance while the employee remains disabled due to an on-the-job injury or illness. 
4.  Accruals. All leave balances and benefits will continue to accrue to the employee while absent due to on-the-job injury or illness. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1212; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7043, 5/9/2007, § 20; Ord. No. 7191, 6/11/2008, § 1) 
4-4-30-030 - Weapons policy. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. The city/BLW's employees are its most valuable resource and, for that reason, their health and safety is of paramount concern. As such, the purpose and intent of this policy are to promote safe and secure working environments for all city/BLW employees. 
B.  Weapon Defined. For purposes of this policy, the term "weapon" means the following: any explosive compounds (including fireworks); firearms (including those designed to fire or expel bullets, pellets, BBs, paintballs, arrows, darts, or other projectiles); Tasers or other electrical stunning devices; knives (with blades longer than three inches); pepper spray, mace, or other noxious chemicals or substances designed to incapacitate; any club, baton, metal or plastic knuckles, or other bludgeon; and any other instrument, device, or item designed, modified, or adapted for use primarily as a weapon. The term "weapon" also includes any of the foregoing instruments, devices, or items that are non-functional, unloaded, or imitation (excluding obvious toys). The term "weapon" does not include any tool provided or approved for an employee's use by the city/BLW; provided, however, that the use or threatened use of any such tool (or any other instrument, device, or item not referenced above or not normally regarded as a weapon) as a weapon shall be considered to be a violation of this policy. 
C.  Scope. This policy shall apply to all city/BLW employees other than sworn or unsworn employees of the police department or employees who otherwise work under the supervision of the chief of police. The chief of police shall implement a standard operating procedure regulating and determining the possession, carrying, and transportation of firearms and other weapons by sworn and unsworn employees of the police department or who otherwise work under his or her supervision, in accordance and consistent with state and federal law.

4-4-34-060 - Authorization for travel/training. 
A.  As soon as the requesting party becomes aware of the need to travel, he should prepare and submit a request for travel and training form to his authorizing party. All estimated expenses and a description of each expense should be filled out on one form. For example, registration, lodging, airfare, mileage and all other costs should not be submitted on multiple request forms. The form should be submitted to the authorizing party in sufficient time for the authorizing party to adequately assess it and forward the request to the finance department, budget officer and, if necessary, the city manager or his designee. 
B.  The authorizing party is responsible for determining that: 
1.  There is factual and sufficient justification provided by the requesting party to permit approval and that the request only includes expenditures for expenses authorized under this policy. 
2.  There is sufficient unexpended appropriation amount remaining in the department's travel budget to reimburse all anticipated costs of travel. Inquiries regarding the remaining budget balance available can be done through the information available to the department head via online access to the GMBA information on the computer. This will provide the most current information except for trips for which there is no expense report received. 
3.  The authorizing party may approve the request form once he has determined the need and validity of the request. 
C.  When approved by the department head, the original of the request for travel and training form shall be sent to the finance department (to be matched with the subsequently submitted expense report form covering the actual accounting of the trip costs). After review the request form shall be forwarded to the budget officer for verification of funds available, and, if necessary, to the city manager or his designee.

Manual checks will be ready for pickup by 3:00 p.m. The finance director or his designee will determine if the manual check request is of sufficient urgency to warrant issuing a manual check. 
(Code 1978, § 4-1236; Ord. No. 4981, 11/13/91, § 1; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96; Ord. No. 7043, 5/9/2007, § 24) 
4-4-34-070 - Expense reimbursement. 
The following reimbursement guidelines are intended to set forth maximum standards. Employees of the city/BLW are expected to spend funds prudently. All travel and training expenses should be submitted for reimbursement on the approved travel and training expense form. 
A.  Subsistence. 
1.  Lodging. Reimbursement for lodging is authorized when the individual's travel requires overnight accommodation. Overnight accommodations are generally not considered necessary within the metro-Atlanta area, however, overnight accommodations will be considered for approval on a case-by-case basis by the city manager or his designee. Detailed receipts (not charge slips) are required for all lodging costs. Charges for meals and telephone calls that are included in hotel/motel bill should be extrapolated for reporting purposes. If a per diem is used, charges for individual meals are not authorized. 
a.  Lodging shall be a standard hotel/motel consistent with other facilities available in the area. 
b.  Accommodations shall be reimbursed at actual costs incurred at the single room rate. 
c.  When two employees share a room, one employee shall pay and request reimbursement for the full lodging charge. The second employee shall not be entitled to any reimbursement since they did not incur any expense. 
d.  The requesting party is responsible for obtaining a tax exempt statement from the finance department prior to departure and give the statement to the registrar at their hotel/motel upon arrival. It is recognized that different hotel/motels acknowledge such statements to varying degrees. 
2.  Meals. 
a.  Meals During Overnight Travel. Employees are entitled to reimbursement for meals based on a per diem amount for overnight travel only. The per diem rate is $40.00 per day and may be amended periodically by the city council. The per diem should be sufficient in most locales visited by the requesting party. Receipts are not required when requesting reimbursement at per diem rates. Occasionally, due to the location of the travel, the per diem rate may be insufficient. Reimbursement in excess of the per diem rate will be considered only when supported by receipts clearly proving more cost was incurred. This is intended to reimburse the traveler for higher costs in major cities and not provide a reason to spend more. The department heads are expected to carefully monitor and specifically approve/deny requests for reimbursement in excess of the per diem rate. 
Breakfast allowance will not be authorized, either in a per diem calculation or based on receipt, if the business travel was initiated from the employee's home as the first business activity of the day. If the requesting party returns to their home or to Cobb County before 2:00 p.m., then the $10.00 allotment for lunch for that day's travel per diem will be deducted. If the requesting party returns to their home or to Cobb County before 7:00 p.m., then the $15.00 allotment for dinner of that day's travel per diem will be deducted. 
b.  If meals are provided as a part of the registration, such meals should be deducted from the per diem authorized by the following amounts of the per diem: $7.00 for breakfast, $10.00 for lunch and $15.00 for dinner. Example: At a per diem rate of $40.00 per day with a luncheon that is provided as a part of the registration, the reduced per diem for that day of the conference would be $40 - $10 = $30. 
c.  Single Day Travel. Reimbursement may be made for meal expense during single day travel based on the individual meal allotment amounts described in the above paragraph if the following requisite conditions exist: 
Breakfast—Generally, no reimbursement will be authorized for breakfast during a single day trip unless the employee is attending a formal breakfast at which the city/BLW business is conducted or a breakfast that is included as a part of a registration fee for a workshop, seminar, etc. 
Lunch—Generally, no reimbursement will be authorized for lunch during a single day trip except under the following conditions: 
(1)  The employee cannot return from city/BLW business before 2:00 p.m.; or 
(2)  The employee is attending a formal luncheon at which city/BLW business is conducted. 
(3)  The luncheon is included as a part of a registration fee for a workshop, seminar, etc. 
Dinner—Reimbursement may be authorized provided the employee returns to their home or to Cobb County after 7:00 p.m. 
B.  Transportation Expense. Transportation shall be reimbursed at the most economical rate for the most economical and practical method of travel. Example: The traveler may choose to travel by personal vehicle, perhaps so that his family may go along; however, the most economical method is to fly at coach rates with the ticket for the employee purchased through the city-designated travel agency. Therefore, the traveler would be reimbursed for the amount of such coach ticket. 
1.  Ticketed Travel. A travel agency in the metropolitan Atlanta area shall be selected by the purchasing division with the approval of the city manager to be the city/BLW's sole agent for providing travel reservations and ticketing for a predetermined time period. All requesting parties who anticipate overnight travel or air travel should check with this travel agency as to the most economical method of travel. Employees have the option of arranging air travel through this agency in which case the invoices will be paid directly to the agency by the finance department. Employees also have the option of booking air travel via the Internet and charging the fare to their personal credit card. Reimbursement to the employee will be made using the travel and training expense form. The authorizing party should certify that the method of travel selected is the most economical and practical method for the city/BLW. 
Reimbursement for ticketed travel expense should be substantiated by the traveler's copy of the ticket or travel agency invoices as well as copies of any automobile rental contracts. 
2.  City Vehicles. The use of a city/BLW vehicle is authorized for travel to a destination of up to 400 miles from Cobb County. Operation of the city/BLW vehicle outside the State of Georgia requires the prior approval of the department head. 
If more than one employee is attending the same conference or business meeting, only one city/BLW vehicle shall be used until the limit of the capacity of such vehicle is attained. 
Gasoline and oil should not, except in emergency situations, be purchased for city/BLW vehicles at commercial providers in the metropolitan Atlanta area. The traveler in the metropolitan area should prepare the city/BLW vehicle for anticipated travel at the motor transport division or other designated city/BLW loading areas. 
Receipts must be obtained for all city/BLW vehicle expenses incurred, including gasoline purchases, for reimbursement approval. 
City/BLW vehicles may be driven only by city/BLW employees and officials. 
3.  Personal Vehicles. 
a.  Advance approval for use of a personal vehicle for business travel must be obtained from the department head. Advance approval for department and division heads for personal vehicle usage is not necessary, but the criteria below will be applied for approval for reimbursement purposes. 
Use of a personal vehicle may be authorized only if one of the following conditions is met: 
(1)  No suitable city/BLW vehicle is available. 
(2)  Round trip travel mileage is less than 100 miles. 
(3)  The requesting party has a physical handicap which requires the use of a specially equipped vehicle. 
(4)  An employee's family member(s) accompany the employee on the trip. 
(5)  The most economical and practical method to attend a conference or seminar is the use of a personal vehicle. 
b.  Mileage expense authorized shall be calculated from the initiating point of the business travel (either from the employee's home or the work site). If personal usage of the vehicle occurs while on business travel, such mileage shall be deducted from authorized business travel mileage. The mileage reimbursement rate is $0.40 per mile [effective July 1, 2007] and may be increased or decreased by council action. Requested mileage reimbursement must be supported by odometer readings (as amended by Ord. No. 5300, 5/11/94). 
c.  Employees who are directed to utilize their personal vehicles for the conduct of city/BLW business, should be reimbursed for all business miles driven during such trips. Employees who are routinely assigned to conduct city/BLW business through the use of their personal vehicles should complete a monthly mileage log which should indicate the time and date the trip was initiated and completed, purpose of the trip and odometer readings at the beginning and end of the trip. 
Reimbursement for the business use of a personal vehicle constitutes all compensation for the use of the vehicle including insurance for property damage to the vehicle, breakdown repairs, etc. 
4.  Rental Cars. 
a.  A rental car may be used when: 
(1)  The traveler has flown to a location; and 
(2)  Travel between sites at such location is necessary for the conduct of city/BLW business; and 
(3)  It is determined that no other mode of transportation is as economical or practical, i.e., taxi, subway, bus; and 
(4)  Is preapproved by the department head or city manager or his designee. 
b.  Rental cars should be limited to a maximum of "mid-size" automobiles with standard accessories unless special circumstances dictate a larger vehicle which should be preapproved by the department head or city manager or assistant city manager. 
c.  Receipts are required for the reimbursement of any rental car costs, including gas. Purchase of insurance for rental vehicles at the time of rental is not necessary. 
5.  Local Ground Transportation. Travelers on authorized trips outside the metropolitan area may be reimbursed for local transportation costs incurred in the conduct of city/BLW business, such as, taxis, subways, etc. Receipts for such services should be obtained when possible and provided to support reimbursement. Such receipts should not contain reimbursements for tips since tips are to be accounted for out of the allowed per diem. If receipts cannot be obtained, the employee shall certify as to the accuracy of the amount paid on the expense report upon return. 
C.  Registration. Registration fees are paid by the finance department in advance of the trip provided the travel request with sufficient documentation is received two weeks in advance of the date that a check is needed. The requesting party should make every attempt to take advantage of discounted registration fees by meeting early-bird registration deadlines. If advance registration is not utilized, registration fees for approved conferences or seminars are reimbursable when supported by receipts. An expense report for registration fees is necessary even if the employee did not receive any additional funds for the training. 
D.  Miscellaneous Expenditures. 
1.  Parking Fees. Parking fees for business travel will be reimbursed when supported by receipts. 
2.  Toll Road/Bridge Charges. Toll charges for business travel will be reimbursed when supported by receipts for amounts of $1.00 or more per charge and by certification of the employee for amounts less than $1.00 per charge. 
3.  Telephone Calls. Necessary business related telephone calls are reimbursable when supported by receipts. No personal calls are reimbursable. 
Other travel related expenses are reimbursable when it is supported by receipt and it is determined by the department head that such expense was to the benefit of the city/BLW. 
E.  Expense Reports. 
1.  Upon returning from an authorized trip, the requesting party shall present to the authorizing party a complete itemization of all trip expenses on an expense report form within five calendar days after returning from the trip. Such report will be prepared accurately and completely including all required receipts and explanations to facilitate its review, understanding and processing. Failure to provide the required receipts will result in the unsupported amount not being reimbursed. The authorizing party shall review, sign and submit the expense report to the finance department within two workdays after receipt from the requesting party. The employee signature on the expense reports will be certification by the employee that all expenses paid are compliant with this policy. 
2.  Settlement of Travel Advances. If the requesting party received a travel advance that was greater than the actual expenses incurred, a check in the amount of the unused portion of the advance must accompany the expense report. Any travel advance that remains outstanding for periods greater than 15 calendar days from the date of return, shall be deemed a salary advance and may be deducted from the employee's next paycheck. Further advances will not be issued until the employee has settled all previous travel advances. 
3.  Finance Department Review. The finance department shall audit all expense reports to determine mathematical accuracy; cross reference amount claimed to appropriate receipts; and review the appropriateness of expenditures in accordance with this policy. Upon determination of accuracy and compliance, the finance department will authorize the issuance of a check of net amounts due to the employee in the event that actual expenses exceed any advance taken. Reimbursement as a result of an expense report will be processed only after the report has been matched with the travel request form. If a reimbursement is due to the requesting party, the budget officer will approve the expense form verifying that funds are available for such reimbursement. Submission of inaccurate expense reports will result in return to the authorizing party for correction and resubmission, possible disallowance of amounts requested to be reimbursed and review for possible disciplinary action. 
4.  Falsification of Expense Report. An employee who submits a false claim for reimbursement will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

4-12-2-025 - Employee health insurance and protected health information. 
A.  Purpose: To establish privacy procedures to assure that the confidentiality of individually identifiable health information is protected, to inform employees of their privacy rights and obligations and how their protected health information (PHI) may be used and disclosed. 
B.  Policy: The City of Marietta/BLW (plan sponsor) established and maintains a group health plan (the "plan") for its employees and covered dependents. The Plan is a covered entity and is required to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. The plan sponsor is not a covered entity but is responsible for ensuring that the group health plan is in compliance with the privacy regulations. The privacy regulations will give employees and covered dependents more control and access to their PHI. It will limit the use and disclosure of health information; enable participants to find out how their information may be used and what disclosures of their information have been made. Medical information relating to family and medical leave, fitness-for-duty and workers compensation is not covered under the regulations. It is the policy of the City of Marietta Group Health Plan to protect the privacy of protected health information and to comply with HIPAA Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information. Where state law is more restrictive than the privacy regulations, Georgia state law will prevail. The city/BLW specifically reserves the right to add to, change or abolish the provisions of this policy, in whole or in part, based upon pertinent action by any appropriate legislative, judicial or regulatory authority. 
C.  Definitions: 
Covered Entities. Health plans (includes health flexible spending accounts), health care clearinghouses and those health care providers who conduct certain financial and administrative transactions electronically. 
Protected Health Information. Individually identifiable health information that is maintained or communicated in any form (electronic, paper, or oral) by a covered entity. 
D.  Uses and Disclosures of Protected Health Information (PHI): 
1.  Required Uses and Disclosures. The plan is required to give employees and dependents access to their own protected health information (PHI) upon request and will disclose PHI to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services when needed to investigate or determine if the city/BLW is in compliance with the privacy rules. 
2.  Permitted Uses and Disclosures to Carry Out Treatment, Payment and Health Care Operations. 
a.  The plan and/or its business associates may use and disclose protected health information without the employee's consent, authorization or opportunity to agree or object to carry out treatment, payment or health care operations. 
Treatment includes the provision, coordination or management of health care. For example, the plan may tell a doctor who is treating a covered individual that the individual has previously been treated for a condition that may affect his treatment of the individual. 
As defined by the privacy rule, payment includes but is not limited to actions to make coverage determinations and payment (including billing, claims management, subrogation, plan reimbursement, reviews for medical necessity, appropriateness of care, utilization review and preauthorization). For example, the plan may tell a doctor whether the employee is eligible for coverage or what percentage of the bill will be paid by the plan. 
Health care operations include but are not limited to quality assessment and improvement, reviewing competence or qualifications of health care professionals, underwriting, premium rating and other insurance activities relating to creating or renewing insurance contracts. It also includes disease management, case management, conducting or arranging for medical review, legal services and auditing functions including fraud and abuse, compliance programs, business planning and development, business management and general administrative activities. For example, the plan may use information about the employee claims to refer the employee to a disease management program, reimburse business associates for claims paid on behalf of the plan or project future benefit costs or audit the accuracy of its claims processing functions. 
b.  The plan may disclose information to business associates as needed to enable them to provide business services on behalf of the plan. Business associate services may include claims administration, legal, actuarial, consulting, accounting and financial services. For example, the plan may disclose information to a consultant that performs actuarial services, cost sharing methodology, budgeting and plan design changes on behalf of the plan. 
The plan requires all business associates to sign contracts agreeing: 
(1)  Not to use or disclose the PHI other than as permitted by the contract or as required by law; 
(2)  Use appropriate safeguards to prevent the use or disclosure of the information other than as provided by the contract or by the privacy rules; 
(3)  Assist the plan in complying with the regulations by providing participants upon request access to protected health information disclosures. 
c.  Where the plan sponsor does not already have access to PHI by virtue of its role in administering the plan, the plan will not disclose PHI to the plan sponsor except when the disclosure is: 
(1)  Limited summary health information for insurance placement or settlor functions; 
(2)  Enrollment and disenrollment information; 
(3)  Involved in plan administration when the plan sponsor complies with certain administrative requirements involving an amendment of the plan document and the erection of proper firewalls; and 
(4)  Authorized by the individual to whom it applies. 
The plan sponsor has amended the plan document and certified that the plan sponsor will appropriately safeguard and limit the use and disclosure of protected health information to carry out plan administration functions. Plan administration functions do not include employment-related functions or functions in connection with other benefits. 
3.  Uses and Disclosures that Require the Employee's Written Authorization. Any written authorization for the plan to disclose PHI other than as described herein shall be in plain language and satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  It must include a description of the information to be used or disclosed that identifies the information in a specific and meaningful fashion. The authorization may by its terms apply to all health information. 
b.  It must include the name or other identification of the person or class of persons authorized to use or disclose the PHI. 
c.  The authorization must specify the name or other specific identification of the person or class of persons to whom the plan is authorized to make the requested use or disclosure. 
d.  The authorization must describe the purpose of the requested use or disclosure. 
e.  The authorization must include an expiration date or an expiration event. An expiration event must relate to the individual or the purpose of the use or disclosure. 
f.  The authorization must be dated and include a signature of the individual or the individual's authorized representative. When an authorized representative signs the authorization, it must include a description of the representative's authority to act for the individual. 
g.  The authorization must include a statement describing the individual's right to revoke the authorization and of the mechanism for making such a revocation, as to disclosures that have not taken place before the revocation is received by the plan. 
h.  The authorization must state either that the plan may not condition treatment, payment, enrollment or eligibility on the individual's execution of an authorization or, when this is not accurate, describe the consequences of not providing the authorization. 
i.  The authorization must include a statement that once information is disclosed pursuant to the authorization, the recipient's use of the information is not subject to the privacy rules. 
The plan will provide the individual with a copy of the signed authorization. The plan may but is not required to maintain a standard authorization form that can be completed by covered individuals. 
Generally, the plan will obtain the employee's written authorization before any uses and disclosures will be made pertaining to psychotherapy notes obtained from a psychotherapist. The plan may use and disclose such notes when needed by the plan to defend against litigation filed by the employee or covered dependent. 
4.  Uses and Disclosures that Require that the Employee be Given an Opportunity to Agree or Disagree Prior to the Use or Release. Disclosures of employees' PHI to family members, other relatives and to employees' close personal friends are allowed if the information is directly relevant to the family or friend's involvement with the employee's care or payment for that care and the employee has either agreed to the disclosure or has been given an opportunity to object and have not objected. 
5.  Uses and Disclosures for Which Consent, Authorization or Opportunity to Object is Not Required. Use and disclosure of the employee's PHI is allowed without the employee's consent, authorization or request under the following circumstances: 
a.  When required by law. 
b.  When permitted for purposes of public health activities.

h.  When authorized by law to a coroner or medical examiner for the purpose of identifying a deceased person, determining a cause of death or other duties as authorized by law. 
i.  When authorized by and to the extent necessary to comply with worker's compensation or similar programs established by law. 
Except as otherwise indicted in this policy, uses and disclosures will be made only with the employee's written authorization subject to the employee's right to revoke such authorizations. 
6.  Verification of Identity of Person Requesting PHI. The plan will verify the identify of any person requesting PHI by requesting the person's name, address, business affiliation, phone number and signature, and/or such other identification as it deems appropriate. The plan will document the responses it receives and, when appropriate, take steps to confirm that the information is accurate. 
7.  Minimum Necessary. The plan and plan sponsor will make every reasonable effort to limit their use and disclosure of PHI to the minimum necessary unless there is a specific exception to the rules. The minimum necessary standard will not apply, for example to disclosures authorized by the individual or to information that is used for treatment. 
8.  De-identified PHI. Information that has been de-identified so that all identifying information is removed may be disclosed. 
E.  Participant Rights and Responsibilities: 
1.  Right to Request Restrictions on PHI Uses and Disclosures. Participants may request that the plan restrict the use or disclosure of the participant's PHI, even for treatment, payment, or health care operations. However, the plan is not required to agree to the restriction.

The requested information will be provided within 30 days if the information is maintained on site or within 60 days if the information is maintained offsite. A single 30-day extension is allowed if the plan is unable to comply with the deadline provided the plan notifies the participant within the original 30-day time limit. 
3.  Right to Amend PHI. Participants have a right to request amendment to the participant's PHI. The plan must comply within 60 days unless the plan did not create the PHI or believes the amendment is inaccurate. A single 30-day extension is allowed if the plan is unable to comply within the deadline. if the request is denied, the plan will provide the participant with a written denial that explains the basis of the denial. The participant may submit a written statement disagreeing with the denial and have a statement included with any future disclosure of the participant's PHI. 
4.  Right to Receive an Accounting of PHI Disclosures. At the participant's request, the plan will provide the participant with an accounting of disclosures of PHI by the plan during the six years prior to the date of the request. However, the plan is not required to provide an accounting for: 
a.  Disclosures made prior to the April 14, 2003, compliance date. 
b.  Disclosures to carry out treatment, payment or health care operations. 
c.  Disclosures made to the participant. 
d.  Disclosures made under some of the exceptions, such as for law enforcement purposes. 
e.  Disclosures the individual has authorized. 
5.  Right to Request Alternative Communications of PHI.

F.  Personal Representative: The employee or his or her personal representative will be required to complete a form to request access to this information. A personal representative will be required to produce evidence of his or her authority to act on the employee's behalf before that person will be given access to the employee's PHI or allowed to take any action for the employee. Proof of such authority may take one of the following forms: 
1.  A power of attorney for health care purposes, notarized by a notary public; 
2.  A court order of appointment of the person as the conservator or guardian of the individual; 
3.  An individual who is the parent of a minor child.

To request access to PHI or to obtain a form for this purpose, please contact the benefits manager whose office is located in the human resources department. The benefits manager has 30 days to respond to the employee's request and 60 days if someone else holds the information or it is offsite. If the employee's request is denied, the employee or his or her personal representative will be provided with a written denial setting forth the basis of the denial, the complaint procedure and how the employee or personal representative may file a complaint to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

4-12-2-040 - Retiree health insurance. 
A.  All full-time employees hired between August 14, 1991 and October 31, 2006, may continue their health insurance coverage after retirement from active service. Effective July 1, 2003, the city/BLW will contribute toward the cost of retiree health insurance for such employees on the following basis: 
1.  20+ years of employee service. If hired after August 14, 1991, and before November 14, 1996, the city will contribute 100 percent of the calculated premium cost of retiree health care coverage (HMO and PPO plans). If hired between November 14, 1996 and October 31, 2006, the city/BLW will contribute 100 percent of the calculated premium cost of the retiree coverage on the city/BLW's basic health care plan (currently the HMO plan). The city/BLW will not contribute to the calculated premium cost of retiree dependent coverage except that the calculated premium cost to the retiree if he/she elects to cover such dependents will be frozen at time of retirement. 
2.  15—19 years of employee service. If hired after August 14, 1991, and before November 14, 1996, the city/BLW will contribute 80 percent of the calculated premium cost of retiree health care coverage (HMO and PPO plans). If hired between November 14, 1996 and October 31, 2006, the city/BLW will contribute 80 percent of the calculated premium cost of the retiree coverage on the city/BLW's basic health care plan (currently the HMO plan). The calculated premium cost to the retiree for retiree coverage will be frozen at time of retirement. The city/BLW will not contribute to the calculated premium cost of retiree dependent coverage and rate increases for dependent coverage will be passed on to the retiree as they occur. 
3.  10—14 years of employee service. If hired after August 14, 1991, and before November 14, 1996, the city/BLW will contribute 50 percent of the calculated premium cost of retiree health care coverage (HMO and PPO plans). If hired between November 14, 1996 and October 31, 2006, the city/BLW will contribute 50 percent of the calculated premium cost of the retiree coverage on the city/BLW's basic health care plan (currently the HMO plan). The calculated premium cost to the retiree for retiree coverage will be frozen for such employees at time of retirement. The city/BLW will not contribute to the calculated premium cost of retiree dependent coverage and rate increases for dependent coverage will be passed on to the retiree as they occur. 
4.  Less than 10 years of employee service. If hired between August 14, 1991 and October 31, 2006, the employee may continue their health coverage after retirement from continuous, active service, but the retired employee must pay 100 percent of the retiree calculated premium cost and 100 percent of the dependent calculated premium cost if the retiree elects dependent coverage and all rate increases thereon. 
5.  The city/BLW regularly monitors the marketplace for legitimate opportunities to reduce the cost of retiree health care coverage without reducing or otherwise negatively impacting such coverage. When such opportunities are identified and implemented, the city/BLW desires to be able to pass some or all of the resulting cost reductions on to the retirees receiving such coverage. To this end, for purposes of Section 4-12-2-40, the term "frozen at retirement" henceforth shall mean that the calculated premium cost to the retiree for retiree coverage shall not exceed the cost paid by the retiree at the time of his/her retirement. As so defined, nothing in Section 4-12-2-40 shall preclude the city/BLW, in its sole discretion, from reducing the calculated premium cost to the retiree below the cost paid by the retiree at the time of his/her retirement when the circumstances described above so permit. Likewise, in the event the calculated premium cost to the retiree is so reduced, the city/BLW reserves the right to increase said premium cost up to, but not in excess of, the cost paid by the retiree at the time of his/her retirement. Nothing in this section is intended or shall be interpreted or applies as granting any retiree a vested or enforceable right to retiree coverage at a premium cost below the cost he/she paid at the time of his/her retirement. 
B.  All full-time employees hired on or after November 1, 2006, with a minimum of 10 years full-time continuous, active service may continue their health care coverage after retirement provided such health care coverage is elected and provided by the City of Marietta at time of retirement. Effective November 1, 2006, the city/BLW will contribute toward the cost of this retiree health insurance on the following basis for such employees: 
1.  20+ years of continuous employee service for those employees hired on or after November 1, 2006. The city/BLW will contribute 85 percent of the calculated premium cost of retiree single coverage for the City/BLW's basic health care plan (currently the HMO). Such benefit will be limited to cover the city/BLW retiree only. The dollar amount of the retiree contribution will not be frozen and will increase as the calculated premium cost for coverage increases to the city/BLW. The city/BLW will not contribute to the calculated premium cost of retiree dependent coverage and rate increases for dependent coverage will be passed on to the retiree as they occur. 
2.  10—19 years of continuous employee service for those employees hired on or after November 1, 2006. The city/BLW will not contribute toward the calculated premium cost of any retiree health plan chosen by the retired employee. The employee may purchase city/BLW group retiree health care coverage and dependent health care coverage, but will be responsible for 100 percent of all incurred costs including future rate increases on any plan selected. 
3.  Less than 10 years of continuous employee service for those employees hired on or after November 1, 2006. Employees who retire with less than ten years' service are not eligible to purchase retiree or dependent health care coverage through the City of Marietta/BLW. 
C.  No current terminated vested retiree nor any employee who will subsequently receive a terminated vested retirement benefit is eligible to receive health insurance benefits from the city.

4-12-2-050 - Retirement plan; JMERS coverage terminated.

(Ord. No. 4522, 11/12/86, § 1) 
Section 3. Qualifications for participation. 
A.  Each employee, other than elected and appointed members of the governing authority, who is, on the effective date of the plan, regularly employed in the services of the city shall be qualified to apply for participation in the plan: 
1.  If he has completed one (1) year of continuous service on or prior to the effective date of the plan, or 
2.  On the first day of the month immediately following or coinciding with the date subsequent to the effective date of the plan that he completes one (1) year of continuous service provided that the period of service between the effective date of the plan and his enrollment date was continuous and uninterrupted.

C.  Any eligible employee whose employment terminates and who later resumes employment in an eligible employee level shall be considered a new employee as of his date of reemployment unless he meets one of the following conditions: 
1.  A former participant who is reemployed in an eligible employee level within one (1) year after termination of his employment with the city may resume participation on the first day of the month immediately following or coinciding with his reemployment, but the time he was absent shall not be taken into account for the purpose of calculating retirement or termination benefits under the plan. 
2.  A former participant who is reemployed in an eligible employee level after a period of involuntary service in the Armed Forces of the United States, and who meets the provisions of article III, section 4d, may resume participation on the first day of the month coinciding with or next following the month in which he is reemployed, but the time he was absent shall not be taken into account for the purpose of calculating retirement or termination benefits under the plan unless otherwise authorized by the governing authority. 
3.  A former participant who is reemployed in an eligible employee level after being on an authorized leave of absence and who meets the provisions of article III, section 4D, may resume participation on the first day of the month coinciding with or next following the month in which he is reemployed in accordance with the terms of the leave as approved by the governing authority.

The employee shall have no right whatsoever to participate or become eligible to participate in the general employee portion of the retirement plan adopted by Ordinance No. 4022 as such portion has been terminated by the city. The employee also has no right to continue participation in the public safety portion of the retirement plan adopted by Ordinance No. 4022 after the employee moves to a general employee position. However, the employee shall be entitled to a vested right in his accrued retirement benefits, and shall have the option to receive benefits upon retirement as a public safety participant under the 4022 plan from the time the employee became eligible to the date the employee moves to a general employee position and benefits under the consolidated retirement plan from the date the employee changes to a general employee position to the date of retirement, or the employee may waive all rights to receipt of benefits under the 4022 plan and have all benefits calculated under the consolidated retirement plan at the date of retirement. 
(Ord. No. 6064, 11/10/1999, § 2) 
Section 4. Participation.

B.  Participation in the plan shall not give any eligible employee the right to be retained in the employ of the city nor, upon dismissal, to have any right or interest in the trust fund other than is herein provided. 
C.  For other than elected and appointed members of the governing authority, participation shall be deemed to be automatically terminated by a quit, resignation or discharge, by lapse of recall rights after layoff, by ceasing to be an eligible employee as defined herein, or by failure to return to service as an eligible employee at the end of an approved leave of absence. Participation shall be deemed to be automatically terminated for an elected or appointed member of the governing authority upon vacation of elective office. 
D.  The governing authority shall determine the date of expiration of any leave of absence granted to a participant, other than an elected or appointed member of the governing authority, and if such participant has not returned to his regular employment as an eligible employee in accordance with such determination, his interest, if any, under the plan shall only be such as existed at the commencement of such leave of absence. If a leave of absence has been or is granted to a participant other than an elected or appointed member of the governing authority for the purpose of involuntary service in the Armed Forces of the United States or for some other purpose as approved by the governing authority, he shall for the purposes of the plan not be deemed to have broken continuity of credited future service (but such periods of absence shall not be counted as credited future service for the purpose of computing a pension hereunder unless the leave, as authorized by the governing authority, specifically permits such participant to continue accumulating credited future service during the authorized leave of absence) provided: 
1.  Such a participant was regularly employed by the city immediately prior to his leave of absence, and

(Ord. No. 6509, 5/14/2003, § 1) 
ARTICLE V  Retirement Benefits 
Section 1. Normal retirement benefit. 
A.  Reserved. 
1.  Reserved. 
2.  The monthly retirement benefit is a. or b., whichever is greater: 
a.  One and one-third percent (1.33%) of the final average earnings of the participant, multiplied by total years of credited service plus credit granted pursuant to article II, section 45, divided by twelve (12); or 
b.  The monthly retirement benefit as computed under the plan formerly in existence prior to January 1, 1984; said benefit shall be calculated in accordance with Appendix "A". 
B.  The following provisions shall apply to the calculation of a. above: 
1.  Credited past service. 
a.  Credited past service shall be the amount of past service of a participant. Breaks in regular full-time employment prior to the effective date of the plan followed by five (5) years of service or leave of absence will not break continuity of service but the time absent will not be considered as a period of credited past service. 
b.  Any full-time eligible employee who does not elect to become a participant as of the date he is first qualified to do so may elect to become a participant on the first day of any succeeding month; provided, however, that the credited past service of such participant shall not include the period of service from the date he was first qualified to become a participant to the date he elects to become a participant, or any creditable past service due him on the date he was first qualified to become a participant under the plan; and, further provided that he has enough time remaining until normal retirement age to accrue at least five (5) years of total credited service. 
2.  Credited future service shall be as defined in article II, section 27, and limited to time spent as a participant in the service of the city, except as provided in article III, section 4.D. Breaks in any tenure of elective office of an elected or appointed member of the governing authority will not break continuity of service but the time absent will not be considered as a period of credited future service. 
3.  Total credited service, both past and future, shall be the sum of credited past and credited future service. The amount of total credited service for any participant shall be unlimited except that: 
a.  No credit will be given for service performed as an eligible employee of the city which precedes a participant's most recent date of employment as a new employee; and 
b.  Total credited service shall not exceed the total calendar years and complete months during which a participant was either an eligible employee or an elected or appointed member of the governing authority or both. 
4.  Final average earnings shall mean the average of the annual earnings paid to a participant during any consecutive three (3) year period preceding his actual date of retirement in which his earnings were highest; or if he had less than three (3) years of total credited service, then his final average earnings shall be his average earnings for his total credited service. 
5.  Maximum annual earnings to be used for computing final average earnings shall be unlimited. 
6.  Final average earnings as defined in subparagraph (4) above shall be used for computing the monthly retirement benefit except as herein otherwise provided. 
7.  Full months of credited past and future service shall be treated as fractions of one (1) year. Partial months shall not be included in the calculation. 
C.  An employee who retired under the provisions of any superseded plan prior to November 1, 1973, shall be entitled to a monthly benefit in addition to any benefit he is now receiving, effective the first day of September, 1977, and payable on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of said monthly benefit shall be the difference between (a) the benefit such retired employee is now receiving from New England Life Insurance Company under the terms of the superseded plan and (b) the amount he would have received as a Class 2 participant under the terms of article V, section 1.A. of this plan if this plan had been in effect at the time of his retirement. Any payments made pursuant to this paragraph shall cease upon the death of the retiree. 
(Ord. No. 5923, 11/11/98, § 3; Ord. No. 5939, 12/10/98, §§ 1, 2; Ord. No. 6339, 12/12/2001, § 2) 
Section 2. Early retirement benefit. 
A participant, upon retirement on his early retirement date, shall, at his election, receive either: 
A.  The amount of each monthly retirement benefit for early retirement shall be computed in the same manner as for a normal retirement benefit, but the benefit so computed shall be reduced by .167% for each full month retired early from age fifty-five (55); or 
B.  A delayed monthly retirement benefit under which payment shall commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or next following the retired participant's fifty-fifth (55th) birthday if such participant is a Level 1 employee, or sixty-fifth (65th) birthday if such participant is a Level 2 employee, as defined in article III, section 2, and shall be payable on the first day of each month thereafter during the lifetime of the participant. The amount of each monthly retirement benefit shall be computed in the same manner as for a normal retirement benefit. 
(Ord. No. 5922, 11/11/98, § 1) 
Section 3. Delayed retirement benefit. 
The delayed retirement benefit shall be calculated in the same manner as the normal retirement benefit, and said benefit shall be increased actuarially due to the participant's actual age at retirement in accordance with the tables set forth in Appendix F. 
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in no event may distribution of a participant's retirement benefit commence later than the first day of April in the calendar year following the later of (a) the calendar year in which the participant attains age 70½, or (b) the calendar year in which the participant retires. If, as of January 1, 2002, a participant is an employee in active employment with the employer and is receiving distributions on account of his attaining age 70½, the participant shall continue to receive plan distributions. 
The following rules shall apply for purposes of determining the required minimum distribution to participants and designated beneficiaries (as defined below) for calendar years beginning on and after January 1, 2003, even if, in the case of a designated beneficiary, the participant died before 2003. 
(a)  Required distribution. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to extend any death benefit or permit any beneficiary designation or payment form not otherwise provided or permitted under this plan. This section 3 shall, instead, be deemed to limit and modify any provision of this Plan to the extent that such limitation or modification is necessary to ensure that the plan complies with this section 3, Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder. 
The entire interest of each participant in this plan will be distributed, beginning not later than the required beginning date described above, over the life of such participant or over the lives of such participant and his or her designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such participant or the life expectancy of such participant and his or her designated beneficiary. 
(b)  Death of participant after distribution has begun. If distribution of a participant's interest has begun in accordance with the paragraph (a) above (i.e., distributions on or after the required beginning date), and if the participant dies before his or her entire interest has been distributed to him, then the remaining portion of such interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used under paragraph (a) as of the date of the participant's death. 
(c)  Death of participant before distribution has begun. If a participant dies before distribution of the participant's interest has begun in accordance with paragraph (a) above (i.e., no distributions have been made on or after the required beginning date), the entire interest of the Participant must be paid over whichever of the following periods is applicable: 
(i)  If one or more Designated Beneficiary is not the Participant's Spouse, the distribution period shall be the Designated Beneficiary's remaining life expectancy. 
(ii)  If the sole Designated Beneficiary is the Participant's Spouse, the distribution period shall be the Spouse's remaining life expectancy. 
(iii)  If there is no Designated Beneficiary, the entire benefit (if any is payable) shall be distributed by the end of the calendar year that includes the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death. 
Distributions under paragraph (c)(i)—(iii) above shall commence as follows: 
(x)  Distributions under (c)(i) (i.e., distribution to a non-spouse designated beneficiary) shall begin on or before the end of the calendar year that begins immediately after the calendar year in which the participant died. 
(y)  Distributions under (c)(ii) (i.e., distribution to a spousal designated beneficiary) shall begin on or before the later of the end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died and the end of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age 70½. 
(d)  Form of distribution. Any distribution payable under this section 3 may be paid in any optional form of benefit that is available under the plan, provided that all consent and eligibility requirements under the plan are satisfied. Any annuity form of distribution payable under this plan, however, must satisfy the following requirements: 
(i)  The distribution must be in the form of a periodic annuity for the Participant's life, or for the joint life expectancy of the Participant and Designated Beneficiary or over a period certain that does not exceed the maximum length of the period certain determined under the Regulations. 
(ii)  The interval between payments must be uniform over the entire distribution period and must not exceed one year. 
(iii)  If payments have commenced over a period certain, the period certain may not be changed. 
(iv)  Distributions in the form of a life annuity must satisfy the minimum distribution incidental benefit (MDIB) requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6T, A-2, or any successor regulation thereto. 
(v)  All payments, either in the form of a life annuity or over a period certain must either be non-increasing or increase only in accordance with the rules set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6T, A-1. 
For purposes of this Section 3, references to a life annuity shall include an annuity for the joint life expectancy of the Participant and the Designated Beneficiary. 
(e)  Incidental death benefit requirement. Any optional form of benefit elected by the participant or designated beneficiary must comply with the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G). This rule insures that the retirement benefits payable under the plan are more than incidental. 
(f)  Pension board's discretion. The pension board for the city shall have the sole authority and full discretion to apply the provisions of this section 3 to any benefit option elected by the participant or designated beneficiary. The plan administrator may, for example, modify a participant's selection of an optional form of benefit to satisfy the incidental death benefit requirement by requiring, at its discretion, that the participant select another form of benefit or another contingent annuitant, or by modifying the form of benefit so that it complies with the applicable rules. 
(g)  Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this section 3, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary. 
(i)  Designated beneficiary. The term "designated beneficiary" shall be determined in accordance with the definition of "beneficiary" in the regulations, notwithstanding that this definition may be different from that set forth elsewhere in this plan, provided that any individual who is a designated beneficiary must also be a beneficiary (but not necessarily all of the beneficiaries) as defined in this plan. Each beneficiary, as defined in the plan, however, need not be a designated beneficiary in the event, for example, that a beneficiary disclaims his interest under this plan. 
(ii)  Spouse. "Spouse" shall mean "spouse" as defined in the regulations. Nothing in this section 3 shall be deemed, however, to extend any death benefit or permit any beneficiary designation or payment form not otherwise provided or permitted under this plan. 
(iii)  Regulations. "Regulations" shall refer to the Treasury Regulations (including temporary regulations) promulgated under Code Section 401(a)(9), as set forth in Treasury Regulations 1.401(a)(9)-1 through 1.401(a)(9)-6T, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS in the form of revenue rulings, notices and other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin or any successor thereto. 
(Ord. No. 6340, 12/12/2001, § 3; Ord. No. 6483, 2/12/2003, § 2(2)) 
Section 4. Disability retirement benefit. 
The amount of the disability retirement benefit shall be calculated in the same manner as the normal retirement benefit with no actuarial reduction for age imposed. In no event, however, will a participant's disability retirement benefit be less than fifty percent (50%) of the average of the participant's most recent 12 months of earnings preceding his termination of employment as a result of a disability. Upon retirement on his disability retirement date, a participant shall receive a monthly retirement benefit commencing on the first day of the month coinciding with his disability retirement date and payable on the first day of each month thereafter so long as his disability continues. 
(Ord. No. 6465, 11/13/2002, § 1) 
Section 5. Cost-of-living adjustment. 
A.  The amount of the benefits payable under this plan to a participant classified as a Level 1 employee as defined in article III, section 2, or his beneficiary, shall be adjusted by the current average cost-of-living index figure as provided herein. 
B.  The current average cost-of-living index figure shall be ascertained as of August 1 in each year. 
C.  Each monthly retirement benefit then being received shall thereupon be adjusted as follows: 
1.  Each monthly retirement benefit shall be increased by a percentage equal to the percentage representing the current average cost-of-living index figure divided by each recipient's cost-of-living base figure. If the current average cost-of-living index figure is less than the average cost-of-living index figure determined on August 1 of the previous calendar year, no reduction in the monthly retirement benefit shall be effected. 
2.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, no increase in the amount of a monthly retirement benefit due to changes in the current average cost-of-living index figure effective at any annual adjustment date August 1 shall be in excess of an average increase of four percent (4%) of the amount of the monthly retirement benefits payable immediately prior to such participant's or beneficiary's applicable adjustment date. 
Section 6. Suspension of benefits. 
A.  Any retirement pension payable under this plan to any participant who shall have retired or been retired pursuant to any provisions of article IV or whose service with the city shall have terminated on or after his vesting date shall be suspended as of the date he is reemployed by the city on a full-time basis if retired under article IV, sections 1, 2, 3 and 5 or in any capacity (full-time or less than full-time) if retired under the provisions of article IV, section 4 or holds an elective office of the governing authority except as otherwise provided herein and shall be resumed as of the first day of the month coinciding with or next following his subsequent retirement. In any case where the payment of a participant's retirement pension shall have been so suspended, the retirement pension payable on his subsequent retirement (whether before or after his normal retirement date) shall be the benefit computed in accordance with this article V on the basis of his aggregate credited service, and for an eligible employee on the basis of his final average earnings, at the time of his subsequent retirement, but reduced on an actuarial basis by the value of an early retirement benefits received by him prior to being reemployed as an eligible employee or return to elective office, except that the resulting benefit shall not be less than the benefit payable at the time of his previous retirement. For the purposes of this section 6, any such participant's credited service subsequent to his reemployment by the city or holding of an elective office of the governing authority shall commence as of the date of his reemployment as an eligible employee or as of the date his term of elective office begins, whichever is applicable. 
B.  Any disability retirement pension payable under this plan to any participant who shall have retired or been retired pursuant to any provisions of article IV, section 5, shall be suspended as of the date his disability ceases. In any case where the payment of a participant's disability retirement pension shall have been so suspended, said period of absence from employment due to such disability shall be treated as a leave of absence without pay and the provisions of article III, section 4 shall apply except that such period of absence shall not be counted as credited future service. Any participant who shall have retired or been retired pursuant to the provisions of article IV, section 5 and who dies or who has been or shall be subsequently declared ineligible for a disability retirement benefit because of a cessation of said disability shall have a right to any benefit afforded under any other provision of this plan to which he or his beneficiary might otherwise be entitled. In such a case any disability retirement payments made prior to the date his disability ceases or is declared to no longer exist shall be retained by the retiree and disregarded in computing any other benefit payable under this plan. 
(Ord. No. 6284, 9/12/2001, § 1) 
Section 7. Alternate retirement benefit. 
The alternate retirement benefit shall be calculated in the same manner as the unreduced early retirement benefit in accordance with section 5 of article V of Exhibit B of City Code Section 4-12-6-010, known as the Consolidated Retirement Plan for the Employees of the City of Marietta, Georgia. The participant shall be entitled to elect to receive the benefit in any one of the forms of payment described in article VII of Exhibit B of City Code Section 4-12-6-010, known as the Consolidated Retirement Plan for the Employees of the City of Marietta, Georgia. 
If this alternate retirement benefit is voluntarily elected by the participant, then: 
1.  The participant shall forfeit any and all rights now and in the future to the cost-of-living adjustment set forth in section 5 of article V of this plan, Exhibit A of City Code Section 4-12-4-010, known as the 4022 Retirement Plan. However, any cost-of-living adjustment approved under Exhibit B of City Code Section 4-12-6-010, known as the Consolidated Retirement Plan for the Employees of the City of Marietta, Georgia shall be provided to the participant; 
2.  Survivor benefits shall not be payable upon the death of participant, notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, unless post-retirement benefits are provided under the optional form of payment elected by the participant at retirement; and 
3.  The participant's spouse (if married at retirement) must consent to the election of this retirement option. 
(Ord. No. 6509, 5/14/2003, § 2) 
ARTICLE VI  Optional Form of Retirement Income 
Section 1. Election of optional retirement benefit. 
A participant may elect, or may revoke said election, at any time prior to his actual retirement date, to have his retirement benefit payable under the option hereinafter set forth in lieu of the retirement benefit he is otherwise entitled to receive. The option shall only be available if the participant retires at his normal retirement date. The benefit shall be paid in accordance with the terms of said option. Election of said option shall be made by the participant in writing. 
Any optional form of benefit elected by the participant must comply with the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of proposed Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-2, or its successor. This rule ensures that the retirement benefits payable under the plan are more than incidental. 
(Ord. No. 6340, 12/12/2001, § 4) 
Section 2. Description of option. 
The amount of the optional retirement benefit set forth below shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of benefit that would otherwise be payable to the participant under article V. 
Option A: Social Security option. An increased retirement benefit payable to the participant during his lifetime until his retirement benefits commence under O.A.S.D.I. and a decreased retirement benefit payable thereafter for life in order to have a more level retirement income when such decreased retirement benefit is added to his primary benefits under O.A.S.D.I. determined as of his early retirement date; said benefit shall be computed in accordance with the tables set forth in Appendix "C". At the death of the participant all payments will cease and no further benefits will accrue to the estate of the participant or to other persons except as provided in article III, section 2. This option shall be known as Option A. If the benefit determined to be payable from the plan, when O.A.S.D.I. benefits commence, results in a negative balance, this option cannot be elected. 
(Ord. No. 4548, 4/8/87, § 1) 
Section 3. Cancellation of election. 
The election by a participant of said option in section 2 of this article VI shall be null and void if the participant shall die before benefits commence.

Editorial note— Ord. No. 4655, 7/13/88, § 1, provided as follows: 
Section 1: Ordinance No. 4022, which adopted a new retirement plan for the employees of the City of Marietta, Georgia, is hereby amended by permitting any employee that retired from the City of Marietta, Georgia prior to January 1, 1984, to be eligible to receive the death benefits which have been reinstated pursuant to Ordinance No. 4653. The rights and obligations with respect to any employee or beneficiary that has already commenced to receiving benefits for any for any reason whatsoever prior to the effective date of this Ordinance are fixed and shall be governed by such retirement plan as it existed and was in effect at the time said benefits commenced. It is hereby declared to be the specific intention of the Ordinance that no participant or beneficiary shall be eligible or entitled to receive more than one type of benefit from the City of Marietta, Georgia by virtue of the passage of this Ordinance. Rather, it is the intention of this Ordinance to permit employees that retired prior to January 1, 1984, to be eligible for the death benefits which have been reinstated pursuant to Ordinance No. 4653 but not to provide duplicate benefits for any employee or beneficiary that has already commenced receiving benefits prior to the effective date of this Ordinance. 
Section 3. Termination of employment before retirement. 
A.  A participant, other than an elected or appointed member of the governing authority who is not an eligible employee, whose employment is terminated under any of the following conditions for any reason other than death, disability, or retirement shall be entitled to a vested right in his accrued retirement benefits. Payment of such vested retirement benefit shall commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or next following his normal or early retirement age at the option of the participant and shall be payable on the first day of each month thereafter during the life of the participant. The amount of each monthly retirement benefit shall be computed in the manner prescribed for normal or early retirement in Article V herein, but based upon his final average earnings and total credited service up to the participant's date of termination of employment with the city. 
1.  A participant whose employment is terminated voluntarily or involuntarily shall be entitled to a vested benefit if he has completed a minimum of five (5) years of credited service in the plan. 
2.  A participant whose employment is terminated voluntarily or involuntarily because he is disabled shall be entitled to a vested benefit provided he qualifies for disability retirement under the provisions of the plan within one (1) year of said termination of employment. 
Section 4. Termination of tenure of elective office. 
A participant who is an elected or appointed member of the governing authority and who is not regularly employed in the services of the city shall be entitled to a vested right if he has completed a minimum of ten years of credited service in the plan. 
ARTICLE VIII  Disability Benefits 
Section 1. Definition. 
An employee will be considered disabled if unable, solely because of disease or accidental bodily injury, to work at his or her own occupation or at any reasonable occupation for which the employee is engaged, or may reasonably become engaged, fitted by education, training or experience; provided, however, that such disability shall not have been (a) self-inflicted; (b) incurred in military service; (c) incurred in the commission of a felonious enterprise; or (d) the result of the use of narcotics or drugs or habitual drunkenness. Notwithstanding the fact that an employee may initially be determined disabled, disability benefits shall terminate upon the occurrence of any events set forth in section 5. 
(Ord. No. 4332, 5/14/86, § 1) 
Section 2. Covered employee. 
Only full-time employees who have completed twelve (12) months of continuous service shall be eligible for disability retirement. 
Section 3. Application for disability retirement. 
It is the responsibility of the employee to file an application for disability retirement with the secretary of the pension board within thirty (30) days of the date that the employee last worked or last received pay for the accumulated leave. 
Section 4. Evidence of disability. 
Upon receipt and acceptance for disability retirement by the pension board, the applicant must furnish such evidence of disability in writing from the applicants' physician to substantiate a claim of disability as set forth in the definition of disability established in section 1 above. The pension board may request such additional evidence as it deems necessary to substantiate a disability claim including additional examination by an independent physician of its choice. The cost of such additional examination shall be paid by the City of Marietta. 
Section 5. Termination of disability entitlement. 
A period of total disability ceases on the earliest to occur of the following: 
A.  The date the employee ceases to be totally disabled. 
B.  The date the employee commences work at a reasonable occupation means any gainful activity for which the employee is engaged, or may reasonably become engaged, fitted by education, training or experience. 
C.  The date the employee fails to furnish proof of the continuance of total disability or refuses to be examined when required. 
D.  The date the employee ceases to be under the care of a physician. 
E.  The date of the employee's death. 
Section 6. Successive period of disability. 
Notwithstanding the fact that an employee may initially be determined disabled, and subsequently have disability benefits terminated because of the occurrence of any event set forth in section 5, said employee may continue to be eligible for a successive period of disability benefits, if said employee is later determined disabled again as provided under this article. The purpose of the successive disabilities rule is to encourage the employee to return to full-time work by assuring if the disability occurs again due to the same or related cause soon after returning to work, the employee will not have to complete a new qualifying period in order to qualify for benefits. 
Section 7. Definition of physician. 
The term "physician" means a legally qualified physician, except that with respect to a period of total disability, or any portion thereof, during which total disability is caused by any condition other than a medically determinable physical impairment, "physician" shall mean a legally qualified physician who either specializes in the practice of psychiatric medicine or has by reason of training or experience, a specialized competency in the field of psychiatric medicine sufficient to render the necessary evaluation and treatment of mental illness. To be "legally qualified," an individual must be licensed to practice medicine as a physician under the governing law of his state, territory, or foreign country, and said license must be issued by the respective medical board. In Georgia, the physician must be licensed to practice in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 43-34-1 et seq., as amended. 
(Ord. No. 7872, 3/9/2016, § 1) 
Section 8. Dispute and regulation interpretation. 
In the event that a dispute arises concerning any entitlement or interpretation of any portion of the regulations established under this retirement ordinance, the pension board shall settle such dispute by a majority vote of the members of the board and such decisions are final and binding on all parties subject to provision for appeal and reapplication. 
Section 9. Appeal and reapplication. 
In the event that an applicant for disability retirement is dissatisfied with a decision of the pension board with respect to the employee's entitlement or eligibility for disability benefits, the applicant may reapply for eligibility no sooner than six (6) months from the receipt of the board's decision. Request for reapplication will be considered only where evidence of medical examination indicates a change of medical condition which could influence the board's decision.

ARTICLE XI  Amendment and Termination 
Section 1. Amendment of the plan. 
The governing authority shall have the right at any time, and from time to time, to amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the plan following the review and recommendation by the pension board; provided, however, that no such amendment shall: 
A.  Reduce the accrued benefits of any participant or beneficiary, or 
B.  Authorize or permit any part of the trust fund held by the provider to be diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of participants and their beneficiaries, and 
C.  No amendment shall operate to deprive any participant or beneficiary of any rights or benefits irrevocably vested in him under the plan prior to such amendment except that the governing authority may make any and all changes and modifications necessary to qualify the plan or to keep the plan qualified under the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder, or any amendment thereto. 
Section 2. Termination of the plan. 
A.  The city expects the plan to be continued indefinitely but, of necessity, reserves the right to terminate the plan and contributions thereunder at any time by action of the governing authority.

1.  For each retired participant and beneficiary receiving payment of benefits, the amount and terms of payment of such benefits. 
2.  For each terminated participant entitled to a deferred benefit, the amount, commencement date, and terms of payment of such benefit. 
3.  For each active participant the amount of his accrued benefit. 
B.  The provider shall arrange for the liquidation of all assets held in the trust fund maintained in connection with the plan and shall prepare a statement of the liquidated value of such assets. The governing authority, in its sole discretion, may direct the provider to purchase from an insurance company an annuity contract or contracts which provide the benefits to which each participant or beneficiary is entitled or to pay a lump sum to each participant or beneficiary, such lump sum amount to be actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which such participant or beneficiary is entitled. 
C.  The provider shall then deduct from the assets total remaining expenses incurred or to be incurred by the provider in behalf of the plan. The provider shall except as otherwise provided in this section 2 then allocate the remaining assets for distribution in accordance with the classes listed below. The benefits of each class shall be satisfied before proceeding to the next class. If at any time the remaining plan assets would be insufficient to provide the accrued benefits for the class in question, the remaining assets would be applied on a pro rata basis within that class, and all subsequent classes would receive no benefit. 
Class 1—Retired participants or beneficiaries who are receiving payments on the termination date. 
Class 2—Participants delaying retirement. 
Class 3—Participants eligible for early retirement. 
Class 4—Former employees who are terminated participants. 
Class 5—All other participants on a pro rata basis. 
D.  Upon distribution of the assets as specified above, the plan shall be regarded as terminated and no participant or beneficiary shall have any further rights or claim therein. 
E.  The city hereby terminates the 4022 plan for general employees and any contributions thereunder as there are no employees actively at work currently remaining under the plan. All employees covered by the 4022 plan are in the public safety portion of the plan, and that portion of the plan and any contributions thereunder remains in full force and effect. The city shall notify the provider with written notice that the 4022 plan for general employees has been terminated. The employees shall have no further rights or claim to the 4022 plan for general employees. 
(Ord. No. 6064, 11/10/1999, § 1) 
ARTICLE XII  Miscellaneous 
Section 1. Construction. 
A.  In the construction of the plan all masculine shall include the feminine and the singular the plural in all cases where such meanings would be appropriate. 
B.  The plan shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia. 
C.  In the event that any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this agreement shall be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional, such adjudication shall in no manner affect the previously existing provisions or the other section or sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases of this agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, as if the section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase so declared or adjudicated invalid or unconstitutional were not originally a part hereof. The governing authority hereby declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this agreement or retained the previously existing provisions if it had known that such part or parts hereof would be declared or adjudicated invalid or unconstitutional. 
Section 2. Non-alienation of benefits. 
None of the benefits, payments, proceeds, or distributions payable under the plan shall be subject to the claim of any creditor of any participant or to the claim of any creditor of any beneficiary hereunder, or to any legal process of levy or attachment by any creditor of any such participant or beneficiary; and no such benefits shall be in any manner liable for or subject to the debts, liabilities, engagements, or torts of any participant or beneficiary, and neither any such participant or beneficiary shall have any right to alienate, commute, anticipate, transfer, encumber, pledge or assign any of the benefits, payments proceeds, or distributions under the plan. If any participant or beneficiary shall become bankrupt or attempt to anticipate, assign or pledge any benefits, then such benefits shall, in the discretion of the pension board, cease, and in that event the pension board shall have authority to cause the same, or any part thereof, to be held or applied to or for the benefit of such member, his spouse, his children, or other dependents, or any of them, in such manner and in such proportion as the pension board may think proper. 
Section 3. Legally incompetent. 
Any participant or beneficiary receiving or claiming benefits under the plan shall be conclusively presumed to be mentally competent and of age until the pension board receives a written notice, in a form and manner acceptable to it, that such person is incompetent or a minor, and that a guardian or other person legally vested with the care of his estate has been appointed. In the event that the pension board finds that any person to whom a benefit is payable under the plan is unable to properly care for his affairs, or is a minor, then any payment due (unless a prior claim therefor shall have been made by a duly appointed legal representative) may be paid to the spouse, a child, a parent, or a brother or sister, or to any person deemed by the pension board to have incurred expense for such person otherwise entitled to payment. In the event a guardian of the estate of any person receiving or claiming benefits under the plan shall be appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction, payments shall be made to such guardian provided that proper proof of appointment is furnished in a form and manner suitable to the pension board. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of liability therefor under the plan. 
Section 4. Benefits supported only by trust fund. 
Any person having any claim under the plan will look solely to the assets of the trust fund for satisfaction. In no event will the city, or any of its employees or agents, be liable in their individual capacities to any person whomsoever, under the provisions of the plan. 
Section 5. Discrimination. 
The city, through the pension board, shall administer the plan in a uniform and consistent manner with respect to all participants and shall not permit discrimination in favor of supervisory or highly paid employees, elected or appointed members of the governing authority, the chief legal officer or any associate legal officer of the city, or any municipal officer elected or appointed to preside over the court of said city. 
Section 6. Limitation of liability; legal actions. 
A.  It is expressly understood and agreed by each employee who becomes a participant hereunder that, except for its or their willful neglect or fraud, neither the city, the pension board, nor the provider shall be in any way subject to any suit or litigation, or to any legal liability, for any cause or reason or thing whatsoever, in connection with the plan or its operation, and each such participant hereby releases the city, all its employees and agents, the pension board, and the provider from any and all liability or obligation. 
B.  To any action or proceeding involving any rights under the plan or the proper administration thereof, the city and the pension board shall be the only necessary parties and no participant, or his beneficiary, or any other persons having or claiming to have an interest in the plan shall be entitled to any notice or process. Any final judgment which is not appealed or appealable that may be entered in any such action or proceeding shall be binding and conclusive on the parties hereto and all persons having or claiming to have an interest in the plan. 
Section 7. Claims. 
Any payment to a participant, or beneficiary, or to their legal representatives, in accordance with the provisions of the plan, shall to the extent thereof be in full satisfaction of all claims hereunder against the pension board or the city, either of which may require such participant, beneficiary, or legal representative, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a receipt and release therefor in such form as shall be determined by the pension board or the city, as the case may be. 
Section 8. Application for benefits. 
Any provision in the plan to the contrary notwithstanding, benefits may become payable only after the participant, beneficiary, or their legal representative, whichever is applicable, has made written application therefor to the pension board. Benefits for which no such application has been made within three (3) years following the date of entitlement to such benefits shall be forfeited. In no event shall any forfeitures be applied to increase the benefits any participant or beneficiary would otherwise receive under this plan. 
Section 9. Forfeiture for certain crimes. 
A.  Participation in the plan for any employee in service on July 1, 1985, who is convicted of a public employment related crime (as defined in O.C.G.A. § 47-1-20) on or after July 1, 1985, in the capacity of an employee, shall terminate on the date of final conviction in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 47-1-21. 
B.  Benefits under this plan for any employee hired or rehired after July 1, 1985, who is convicted of a public employment related crime in his or her capacity as an employee (as provided in O.C.G.A. § 47-1-22), including any survivor's benefits if applicable, shall be reduced by an amount equal to three times the economic impact of the crime, upon final conviction. Payment of such benefits shall cease until such amount has been forfeited, after which benefits shall be restored. If the person has not begun to receive a benefit, the deduction shall commence at the time such benefits would normally begin. For purposes of this subsection, the term "benefits" shall not include a refund of employee contributions without interest. 
C.  Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any employee hired or rehired after July 1, 1990, who is not vested under the plan and who is convicted of a drug-related crime (as defined in O.C.G.A. § 47-1-20) shall forfeit all rights and benefits under and membership in the plan, effective on the date of final conviction. Any employee contributions made by any such employee shall be reimbursed, without interest, to the employee within 60 days after the date of final conviction for the commission of the drug-related crime. If an employee who is vested under the plan commits a drug-related crime, such employee's active membership in the plan shall terminate on the date of final conviction. 
D.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to create a right for the employee who is charged with the commission of a public employment or drug-related crime to accrue rights or benefits under this plan after the date the employee ceases to be a member of the plan. 
E.  Within 30 days following the day the pension board receives notice that a member of the retirement system has a final conviction for a public employment-related crime, the pension board shall initiate proceedings in the Office of State Administrative Hearings, under the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 47-1-25 and O.C.G.A. § 50-2-13, to determine the economic impact of the employment related crime. The State Department of Law shall represent the pension board in such proceedings. The decision of the administrative law judge shall be final unless appeal is made as otherwise provided by law. 
F.  For purposes of this Section 9, a final conviction does not include circumstances under which a first offender is exonerated from guilt and discharged as a matter of law after successful completion of sentencing. 
G.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 9 to the contrary and to the extent permitted by applicable law, with respect to employees hired or rehired after July 1, 1985, who committed a public employment related crime before July 1, 2008, the city reserves the right to require forfeiture of all rights and benefits under the plan in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 47-1-22(b) in effect prior to July 1, 2008. 
(Ord. No. 7965, 6/14/2017, § 2)

ARTICLE XIV  Maximum Benefits [4] 
Section 14.01. General rule. 
The annual benefit payable under this plan to a participant at any time shall not exceed the maximum permissible amount. "Maximum permissible amount" shall mean $90,000.00 ($160,000.00, effective for limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2002), as adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury for each calendar year, with the new limitation to apply to limitation years ending within the calendar year of the date of the adjustment (the "dollar limitation"). 
Section 14.02. Reduction for less than ten years of participation or employment. 
If the annual benefit commences when the participant has less than ten years of participation in this plan or any predecessor plan to this plan, the dollar limitation shall be reduced by one-tenth for each year less than ten, but in no event shall be less than one-tenth of the unreduced dollar limitation. 
Section 14.03. Adjustment if the annual benefit commences before age 62 or after age 65. 
If the payment of benefits under this plan commences before age 62 or after age 65, the dollar limitation shall be adjusted as provided in this section 14.03. 
Generally, the age-adjusted dollar limitation is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation payable at age 62 or age 65, as calculated under (i) or (ii) following, whichever is applicable: 
(i)  If the age at which the benefit is payable is less than 62: First, reduce the dollar limitation using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factors, as applicable, which are set forth in the plan for the reduction of benefits for early retirement benefits under the plan. Second, reduce the dollar limitation using 5 percent interest and the applicable mortality table. Use the lesser of the amounts determined under the two preceding sentences as the age-adjusted dollar limitation under this paragraph (i). For limitation years beginning before january 1, 2002, nothing in this paragraph shall reduce the applicable dollar limitation below $75,000.00 if the annual benefit begins at or after age 55. Also for limitation years beginning before january 1, 2002, if the annual benefit begins before age 55, nothing in this paragraph shall reduce the dollar limitation below the actuarial equivalent of the $75,000.00 limitation for age 55. 
Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if a participant is a "qualified participant" (e.g., certain police and firefighters) as defined under Code Section 415(b)(2)(G), such participant may retire before age sixty-two (62), without a reduction in the dollar limitation if at least fifteen (15) years of service is required to receive a full benefit under the plan. 
(ii)  If the age at which the benefit is payable is greater than age 65: The age-adjusted dollar limitation is determined by increasing the dollar limitation on an actuarially equivalent basis. The increased age-adjusted dollar limitation shall be the lesser of the equivalent amount computed using the interest rate and mortality table set forth in Appendix F that is used for actuarial equivalence for delayed retirement benefit under the plan and the equivalent amount computed using 5 percent interest and the applicable mortality table. 
Section 14.04. Special rules. 
(a)  All plans a single plan. For purposes of the maximum limitations of this article, all defined benefit plans maintained by the employer shall be considered as a single defined benefit plan, and all defined contribution plans maintained by the employer shall be considered a single defined contribution plan. 
(b)  Combined plan limitations. If the employer maintains, or has any time maintained, one or more qualified defined contribution plans covering any participant in this plan, the sum of the participant's defined contribution fraction and defined benefit fraction shall not exceed 1.0 in any limitation year, and the annual benefit otherwise payable to the participant under this plan, and not the defined contribution plan, shall be frozen or reduced to the extent necessary so that the sum of such fractions shall not exceed 1.0. The combined plan limitation described in the preceding sentence shall not apply for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2000. 
(c)  Total annual benefits not in excess of $10,000.00. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the annual benefit payable to a participant shall not be deemed to exceed the limits of this article XIV if the annual benefit payable to the participant under this plan and all other defined benefit plans maintained by the employer does not exceed $10,000.00 for the plan year or any prior plan year, and the employer has not at any time maintained a defined contribution plan in which the participant participated. 
(d)  Exceptions for disability or survivors' benefits. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the adjustment prescribed by section 14.03(i) for benefits that commence before age 62, and the reduction described in section 14.02 for fewer than ten (10) years of participation shall not apply to any benefit paid from this plan on account of a participant's becoming disabled by reason of personal injuries or sickness, or amounts received by a beneficiary as a result of the participant's death. This paragraph shall be interpreted in accordance with Code Section 415(b)(2)(I) and any regulations thereunder. 
(e)  Periods prior to 1995. For limitation years beginning before January 1, 1995, the limitations prescribed by Section 415 of the Code, to the extent that they apply to governmental plans, are incorporated herein by reference as of the latest date by which such provisions (if the effective date is elective) may be applied. 
Section 14.05. Definitions. 
For purposes of this article XIV, the following definitions shall apply: 
(a)  Annual additions means the sum of the following amounts credited to a participant's account under a defined contribution plan for the limitation year: 
(i)  Employer contributions; 
(ii)  Forfeitures; 
(iii)  Nondeductible employee contributions; provided, however, that the annual addition for any limitation year beginning before January 1, 1987, shall not be recomputed to treat nondeductible employee contributions as an annual addition; and 
(iv)  Amounts described in Code Sections 415(l)(1) and 419A(d)(2). 
(b)  Annual benefit means a retirement benefit under the plan which is payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity. If a participant's benefit is payable in a non-annuity benefit form, whether as the normal form of benefit or as an optional form which the participant or his beneficiary elects, the non-annuity benefit form is adjusted to an annual benefit as described below. No actuarial adjustment to the non-annuity benefit form is required for (i) the value of a qualified joint and survivor annuity; (ii) the value of benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a disability benefit, pre-retirement death benefits, and post-retirement medical benefits); or (iii) the value of post-retirement cost-of-living increases made in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
To convert a non-annuity benefit form to an annual benefit (i.e., a straight life annuity), first convert the non-annuity benefit form to a straight life annuity using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factors, as applicable, which are specified in the plan for the non-annuity benefit form. Second, convert the non-annuity benefit form to an annual benefit using a 5 percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table. The greater of the amounts determined under the two preceding sentences is the equivalent annual benefit. 
(c)  Applicable mortality table is the table prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury in Revenue Ruling 95-6 or any successor thereto which prescribes the mortality table to be applied pursuant to Code Section 415(b)(2)(E)(v). To the extent that a forfeiture does not occur upon death, the mortality decrement may be ignored prior to age 62 and must be ignored after Social Security retirement age, as prescribed by IRS Notice 83-10, Q&A G-3 and Q&A G-4, or any successor thereto. 
(d)  Compensation means the participant's earned income within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.415-2(d), as limited by Code Section 401(a)(17) and subject, for Limitation Years beginning prior to January 1, 1997, to the family aggregation rules described in article II, section 24, the definition of "earnings". 
(e)  Defined benefit fraction means a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the participant's projected annual benefits under all the defined benefit plans (whether or not terminated) maintained by the employer, and the denominator of which is the lesser of (i) 125 percent of the dollar limitation in effect for the limitation year under Code Section 415(b)(1)(A); or (ii) 140 percent of the participant's highest average compensation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the participant was a participant in a plan maintained by the employer and in existence on July 1, 1982, the denominator of this fraction shall not be less than 125 percent of the sum of the annual benefits under such plans which the participant had accrued as of the end of the last limitation year beginning before January 1, 1983, but determined without regard to changes in the plan or cost-of-living increases occurring after July 1, 1982. The preceding sentence applies only if the defined benefit plans individually and in the aggregate satisfied the requirements of Code Section 415 for all limitation years beginning before January 1, 1983. 
(f)  Defined contribution fraction means a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the annual additions to the participant's account under all the defined contribution plans (whether or not terminated) maintained by the employer for the current and all prior limitation years, and the denominator of which is the sum of the maximum aggregate amounts for the current and all prior limitation years of employment with the employer (regardless of whether a defined contribution plan was maintained by the employer). 
The maximum aggregate amount in any limitation year is the lesser of (i) 125 percent of the dollar limitation in effect under Code Section 415(c)(1)(A); or (ii) 35 percent of the participant's compensation for such year. 
If the employee was a participant in one or more defined contribution plans maintained by the employer which were in existence on July 1, 1982, the numerator of this fraction shall be adjusted if the sum of this fraction and the defined benefit fraction would otherwise exceed 1.0 under the terms of this plan. Under the adjustment, an amount equal to the product of (1) the excess of the sum of the fractions over 1.0 times and (2) the denominator of this fraction, will be permanently subtracted from the numerator of this fraction. The adjustment is calculated using the fractions as they would be computed as of the end of the last limitation year beginning before January 1, 1983. 
(g)  Employer means the City of Marietta, Georgia, or the Marietta Board of Lights and Water. 
(h)  Limitation year means the plan year. 
(i)  Non-annuity benefit form means a benefit, whether a normal form or an optional form, which is not payable in a straight life annuity for the life of the participant. 
(j)  Projected annual benefit means the annual benefit to which the participant would be entitled under the terms of the plan assuming (i) the participant will continue employment until normal retirement age under the plan (or current age, if later), and (ii) the participant's compensation for the current limitation year and all other relevant factors used to determine benefits under the plan will remain constant for all future limitation years. 
Appendix "A" 
The amount of the monthly retirement benefit for service rendered as an eligible employee of the city for purposes of article V, section 1a.2(b) shall be determined as one-twelfth (1/12th) of the sum of (1) and (2) below. 
1.  Past service—One and one-tenth percent (1.1%) of the final average earnings up to the amount of covered compensation applicable to the participant, plus 2.1% (for participants who terminate active service prior to the effective date of this change, the benefit percentage will remain 2%) of final average earnings in excess of the covered compensation applicable to the participant, multiplied by the total years of credited past service. 
2.  Future service—One and one-tenth percent (1.1%) of the final average earnings up to the amount of covered compensation applicable to the participant, plus 2.1% (for participants who terminate active service prior to the effective date of this change, the benefit percentage will remain 2%) of final average earnings in excess of the covered compensation applicable to the participant, multiplied by the total years of credited future service plus credit granted pursuant to article II, section 45. 
Applicable covered compensation as used in (1) and (2) above shall be determined as follows: For participants who retire or terminate vested in a plan year, covered compensation will be based on that participant's year of attaining normal retirement age. 
For purposes of an example only, the following tables are attached hereto as an illustration of the covered compensation tables that will be prepared by the provider or the actuary whichever is directed to do so by the pension board. There will be two tables prepared. In the examples, Table A will be used for Level I employees and Table B will be used for Level II employees. As noted in the new definition of covered compensation, these tables will be updated annually and the tables attached to this ordinance are for purposes of illustration only. If a participant retires or terminates vested in a plan year, you will first determine the year that the participant retires or terminates vested. You will then determine the participant's year of birth which will relate to the year the participant would reach normal retirement age. 
Level I example: 
Using Table "A" that is provided as an illustration, if a Level I participant retires in 1985 and was born in 1939 and therefore will reach age 55 in 1994, the applicable covered compensation would be $20,436. This example is applicable to a Level I participant that retires, early retires or terminates vested. 
Level II example: 
Using Table "B" that is provided as an illustration, if a Level II participant has terminated vested in 1984 and was born in 1931, the applicable covered compensation would be $21,852.

Appendix "C" Calculation of Benefits Under Social Security Option 
The following tables should be used to determine the social security adjustment option benefit. The benefit is an increased monthly benefit payable from retirement date to the commencement of social security, and decreased benefits after such date. The amount of the increased benefit is equal to (a) the monthly benefit the participant would have received at that retirement age, plus (b) his social security amount multiplied by a percentage from Table A-1. If the above amount so determined is less than the participant's social security amount, then the increased benefit is equal to (a) the monthly benefit the participant would have received at that retirement age, multiplied by (b) the appropriate percentage from Table A-2. It should be noted that the participants' expected social security benefit will be determined from tables supplied by the provider. The following examples illustrate how these tables should be applied for both general employees and policemen/firemen. 
Example 1: 
Policemen/firemen 
Normal retirement age: 55 
Actual retirement age: 55 
Monthly benefit at NRA: $500 
Estimated primary social security amount at age 62: $475 
Social security commencement date: At age 62 
Increased benefit up to age 62: $500 + (.628) $475 = $798 
Reduced benefit after age 62: $798-$475 = $323 ** 
*Early retirement factor 
**The reduced benefit at age 62 will be adjusted with the same percentage COLA increases that occurred from actual retirement.

Appendix "E"  Death Benefit Factors 

 
Appendix "F"  Late Retirement Increase Factors 

 
Calculation of Death Benefits: 
The above table should be used to determine the number of monthly payments any designated beneficiary should receive under article VII, section 2. 
If the participant is 56 years of age or older at the time of death, and has already received monthly retirement benefits, the number of monthly retirement benefits received prior to death shall be deducted from the total number of monthly payments expected to be received at retirement age. The remaining number will represent the total number of monthly benefits for the designated beneficiary. 
For purposes of calculating benefits under this table, any participant shall be deemed to be not less than 56 years of age at retirement, regardless of when the participant actually retired or became eligible for any retirement benefits. However, in the event the actual age of the participant is less than 56 at retirement, there shall be no deduction for monthly payments actually received by the participant. 
Notwithstanding the table set forth in this Appendix "E", any designated beneficiary shall receive a minimum of 24 monthly death benefits following the death of the retiree. 
Example: If a participant retires at age 61, his expected number of monthly retirement benefits is 160.10. This figure is rounded off to 160 and represents the total number of monthly payments the participant is expected to receive at retirement. If the participant dies after 8 years and 5 months (101 payments), the designated beneficiary would receive the remaining number of monthly benefits, same being 59 months (160 - 101 = 59).

(ii)  A leased employee within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 414(n)(2);

ARTICLE II  Definitions 
Whenever the terms set forth below are used in this plan, they shall have the meanings indicated below, unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context. Masculine pronouns, when used throughout the plan, shall refer to both men and women, and the singular shall include the plural, unless the context indicates otherwise. Headings of sections are used for convenience of reference, and in the case of conflict, the text of the plan, rather than such headings, shall control. 
Section 1. Actuarial present value. 
Unless otherwise specified in the plan, the actuarial present value of a benefit shall be determined using the interest rate prescribed by the pension benefit guaranty corporation for valuing annuities under the single-employer plans that terminate without a notice of sufficiency during the first month of the calendar year in which the date as of which the benefit is valued, occurs. The mortality assumption shall be based on the 1971 Group Annuity Mortality Table, weighted as follows: 
(a)  For a participant's benefit, 80% male and 20% female; 
(b)  For the benefit of a participant's spouse or former spouse, 20% male and 80% female; and

A participant or beneficiary who would have been required to receive required minimum distributions for 2009 but for the enactment of Code Section 401(a)(9)(H) shall not receive those distributions for 2009 unless the participant or beneficiary chooses to receive such distributions.

This section 7 shall, instead, be deemed to limit and modify any provision of this plan to the extent that such limitation or modification is necessary to ensure that the plan complies with this section 7, Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder. 
The entire interest of each participant in this plan will be distributed, beginning not later than the required beginning date described above, over the life of such participant or over the lives of such participant and his or her designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such participant or the life expectancy of such participant and his or her designated beneficiary. 
(b)  Death of participant after distribution has begun. If distribution of a participant's interest has begun in accordance with the paragraph (a) above (i.e., distributions on or after the required beginning date), and if the participant dies before his or her entire interest has been distributed to him, then the remaining portion of such interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used under paragraph (a) as of the date of the participant's death. 
(c)  Death of participant before distribution has begun. If a participant dies before distribution of the participant's interest has begun in accordance with paragraph (a) above (i.e., no distributions have been made on or after the required beginning date), the entire interest of the participant must be paid over whichever of the following periods is applicable: 
(i)  If one or more designated beneficiary is not the participant's spouse, the distribution period shall be the designated beneficiary's remaining life expectancy. 
(ii)  If the sole designated beneficiary is the participant's spouse, the distribution period shall be the spouse's remaining life expectancy. 
(iii)  If there is no designated beneficiary, the entire benefit (if any is payable) shall be distributed by the end of the calendar year that includes the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
Distributions under paragraph (c)(i)—(iii) above shall commence as follows: 
(x)  Distributions under (c)(i) (i.e., distribution to a nonspouse designated beneficiary) shall begin on or before the end of the calendar year that begins immediately after the calendar year in which the participant died. 
(y)  Distributions under (c)(ii) (i.e., distribution to a spousal designated beneficiary) shall begin on or before the later of the end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died and the end of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age 70½. 
(d)  Form of distribution. Any distribution payable under this section 7 may be paid in any optional form of benefit that is available under the plan, provided that all consent and eligibility requirements under the plan are satisfied. Any annuity form of distribution payable under this plan, however, must satisfy the following requirements: 
(i)  The distribution must be in the form of a periodic annuity for the participant's life, or for the joint life expectancy of the participant and designated beneficiary or over a period certain that does not exceed the maximum length of the period certain determined under the regulations. 
(ii)  The interval between payments must be uniform over the entire distribution period and must not exceed one year. 
(iii)  If payments have commenced over a period certain, the period certain may not be changed. 
(iv)  Distributions in the form of a life annuity must satisfy the minimum distribution incidental benefit (MDIB) requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6T, A-2, or any successor regulation thereto. 
(v)  All payments, either in the form of a life annuity or over a period certain must either be nonincreasing or increase only in accordance with the rules set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6T, A-1. 
For purposes of this section 7, references to a life annuity shall include an annuity for the joint life expectancy of the participant and the designated beneficiary. 
(e)  Incidental death benefit requirement. Any optional form of benefit elected by the participant or designated beneficiary must comply with the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G). This rule insures that the retirement benefits payable under the plan are more than incidental. 
(f)  Pension board's discretion. The pension board for the city shall have the sole authority and full discretion to apply the provisions of this section 7 to any benefit option elected by the participant or designated beneficiary. The plan administrator may, for example, modify a participant's selection of an optional form of benefit to satisfy the incidental death benefit requirement by requiring, at its discretion, that the participant select another form of benefit or another contingent annuitant, or by modifying the form of benefit so that it complies with the applicable rules. 
(g)  Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this section 7, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary. 
(i)  Designated beneficiary. The term "designated beneficiary" shall be determined in accordance with the definition of "beneficiary" in the regulations, notwithstanding that this definition may be different from that set forth elsewhere in this plan, provided that any individual who is a designated beneficiary must also be a beneficiary (but not necessarily all of the beneficiaries) as defined in this plan. Each beneficiary, as defined in the plan, however, need not be a designated beneficiary in the event, for example, that a beneficiary disclaims his interest under this plan. 
(ii)  Spouse. "Spouse" shall mean "Spouse" as defined in the Regulations. Nothing in this section 7 shall be deemed, however, to extend any death benefit or permit any beneficiary designation or payment form not otherwise provided or permitted under this plan. 
(iii)  Regulations. "Regulations" shall refer to the Treasury Regulations (including temporary regulations) promulgated under Code Section 401(a)(9), as set forth in Treasury Regulations 1.401(a)(9)-1 through 1.401(a)(9)-6T, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS in the form of revenue rulings, notices and other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin or any successor thereto. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan to the contrary, distributions from the plan will be made in accordance with a good faith interpretation of Code Subsection 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder as applicable to governmental plans with the meaning of Code Section 414(d) and shall be implemented in accordance with the grandfathering provisions of such regulations applicable to annuity option distributions in effect on April 17, 2001. 
(Ord. No. 6340, 12/12/2001, § 11; Ord. No. 6483, 2/12/2003, § 3(2); Ord. No. 7514, 1/12/2011, § 1; Ord. No. 7733, 6/11/2014, § 2) 
Section 8. Amount of late retirement benefit. 
The monthly amount of the late retirement benefit shall be equal to the benefit determined in section 2 of this article. 
Section 9. Eligibility for a vested retirement benefit. 
A terminated participant shall be eligible to retire and receive a vested retirement benefit if his employment with the employer terminates voluntarily or involuntarily for any reason other than death, normal, early, or disability retirement, provided he has completed at least five years of credited service if hired prior to March 18, 2008, at least seven years of credited service if hired on or after March 18, 2008 through December 31, 2008, or at least ten years of service if hired after January 1, 2009. 
A participant whose employment is terminated voluntarily or involuntarily because he is disabled shall be entitled to a vested benefit provided he qualifies for a disability retirement, (in accordance with section 11 of this article), within one year of termination of employment. Should a participant receiving workers' compensation benefits become qualified to receive disability retirement benefits on or after January 1, 2009, his disability retirement benefit will be reduced by the amount of workers' compensation benefit. Once the participant is ineligible for workers' compensation benefits, his total disability benefit will be restored. 
Benefits shall commence on the first day of the month in which the terminated participant attains his normal retirement date. If an employee is a participant in the plan on March 1, 1987, and later terminates his employment with the employer, he shall be eligible to retire and commence receiving benefits on the first day of any month following his attainment of age 55, provided he has completed at least five years of credited service. 
If an employee becomes a participant in the plan on or after March 18, 2008 through December 31, 2008, and later terminates his employment with the employer, he shall be eligible to retire and commence receiving benefits on the first day of any month following the attainment of age 55, provided he has completed seven years of credited service. 
If an employee becomes a participant in the plan on or after January 1, 2009, and later terminates his employment with the employer, he shall be eligible to retire and commence receiving benefits on the first day of any month following the attainment of age 55, provided he has completed ten years of credited service. 
In the event a participant is involuntarily terminated for reasons other than willful misconduct, he shall be eligible to retire at any time after attaining his early retirement date, provided he has at least 20 years of credited service on the date he terminates his employment. 
(Ord. No. 7142, 3/17/2008, § 1; Ord. No. 7234, 9/10/2008, § 1; Ord. No. 7274, 12/10/2008, § 1) 
Section 10. Amount of vested retirement benefit. 
The monthly amount of the vested retirement benefit shall be equal to benefit determined in section 2 of this article, based on the benefit rate in effect at the time the former participant terminated his employment. 
Section 11. Eligibility for a disability retirement benefit. 
A participant shall be eligible to retire on a disability retirement benefit if he becomes disabled, as defined in section 6 of article II. If the disability is non-job related, the participant must have completed at least 12 months of continuous service. Continuous service shall be defined in the same manner as "Service" under section 24 of article II. 
(Ord. No. 7669, 7/10/2013, § 1) 
Section 12. Amount of disability retirement benefit. 
The monthly amount of the disability retirement benefit shall be determined in accordance with Section 2 of this article. In no event, however, shall the benefit be less than 50 percent of the average of the participant's most recent 12 months of earnings. If the employee has completed an initial 12 months of continuous service, from date of hire to date of termination of employment as a result of a disability, but has less than 12 months of monthly earnings, the disability retirement benefit shall be no less than 50 percent of the average monthly earnings for the actual number of months worked. Continuous service shall be defined in the same manner as "Service" section 24 of article II. 
Should a participant receiving workers' compensation benefits become qualified to receive disability retirement benefits on or after March 18, 2008, his disability retirement benefit will be reduced by the amount of workers' compensation benefit. Once the participant is ineligible for workers' compensation benefits, his total disability benefit will be restored. 
(Ord. No. 6465, 11/13/2002, § 2; Ord. No. 7234, 9/10/2008, § 1; Ord. No. 7669, 7/10/2013, § 2) 
Section 13. Evidence of disability. 
Participants applying for disability retirement must provide such evidence of disability in writing on a form provided by the city, which shall substantiate a claim of disability as set forth in section 6 of article II. When an application for disability pension is filed, the applicant shall submit therewith a signed certificate from a licensed, practicing physician certifying to the total disability of such applicant for a pension under the terms required in section 6 of article II, on a form provided by the city. Such form(s) must be completed in full and include all the information required by such form(s). The pension board may accept such completed form(s) or may order the applicant to be examined by a physician named by the pension board who likewise shall certify the physical ability or total disability, if found, of the applicant under the terms required in section 6 of article II. The pension board shall pay the cost of such additional examination. If the certificates of the respective physicians generally agree upon total disability, such facts shall be conclusive as to the physical or mental condition of the applicant and the pension board shall enter an order granting a disability pension in the proper amount. If the certificate tendered by the applicant and the certification of the physician appointed by the pension board shall disagree as to the condition of the applicant, the pension board shall review the documentation related to the request for disability and shall render a determination as to the disability of the applicant. If the applicant is dissatisfied with the decision of the pension board, the participant shall request and the pension board shall conduct a hearing for the purpose of reviewing the application on appeal. Such hearing shall be conducted informally by the examination of witnesses for and in opposition to such application, and both the applicant and the pension board may be represented by legal counsel if they so desire. Any oral testimony shall be summarized in pension board minutes. Copies of documents may be received as evidence in lieu of the original at the discretion of the pension board, and affidavits shall be filed with the pension board at the time of the hearing. The decision of the pension board after a hearing shall be final as to the physical or mental condition of the applicant; provided, however, any person dissatisfied with the decision of the pension board after such hearing may appeal that decision to council in accordance with section 4 of article X. The applicant shall be entitled to present to council all documents reviewed by the pension board and testimony given during the hearing in making its determination during such final appeal. Council may consider only evidence submitted, heard or considered by the pension board. 
At least once every two years after the pension board approves the applicant's disability retirement, or sooner if specifically requested by the pension board, the applicant must furnish evidence to the pension board of his or her ongoing disability as defined in section 6 of article II, in writing, on a form provided by the city. When the form for an ongoing disability pension is filed, the applicant shall submit therewith a signed certificate from a licensed, practicing physician certifying to the ongoing disability of such applicant for a pension on a form provided by the city under the terms required in section 6 of article II. Such form(s) must be completed in full and include all the information required by such form(s) within 30 days of the earlier of the second anniversary of the pension board's approval of such employee's initial or ongoing disability or the date requested by the pension board. Provided, however, if such participant receiving disability benefits does not provide evidence of and provide all of the information required by the city to show an ongoing disability within such 30-day period defined above, the pension board shall withhold payments of his benefits until he submits the required forms and the participant shall be deemed to have forfeited his benefits during the time of his refusal to submit such required forms. Should the refusal continue for a period of six months, or the participant's physician cannot certify to the participant's ongoing disability, such disability pension shall end and be terminated. 
The pension board shall have the right to require an examination of any and all participants receiving disability pensions under the provisions of this section once every two years by a physician named by the pension board. The pension board shall pay the cost of such additional examination. If any such participant receiving a disability pension shall be found, as a result of such examination, to no longer be disabled in accordance with section 6 of article II, the pension board may, after hearing evidence thereon, and after giving an opportunity to such participant to be heard, remove such participant from the list of those entitled to disability pension. If the applicant is dissatisfied with the decision of the pension board, the participant shall request and the pension board shall conduct a hearing for the purpose of reviewing the application for ongoing disability, in appeal. Such hearing shall be conducted informally by the examination of witnesses for and in opposition to such application, and both the applicant and pension board may be represented by legal counsel if they so desire. Any oral testimony shall be summarized in pension board minutes. Copies of documents may be received as evidence in lieu of the original at the discretion of the pension board, and affidavits shall be filed with the pension board at the time of the hearing. The decision of the pension board after a hearing shall be final as to the physical or mental condition of the applicant; provided however any person dissatisfied with the decision of the pension board after such hearing may appeal that decision to council in accordance with section 4 of article X. The applicant shall be entitled to present to council all documents reviewed by the pension board and testimony given during the hearing in making its determination during such final appeal. Council may consider only evidence submitted, heard or considered by the pension board. 
Provided, however, that in the event a participant receiving disability benefits refuses to submit to a physical examination or does not cooperate with and complete the examination conducted by the physician as requested by the pension board pursuant to this section after 30 days' notice to report for such examination, the pension board shall withhold payments of his benefits until he submits to such examination. The participant shall be deemed to have forfeited his benefits during the time of his refusal to submit to a physical examination. Should the refusal continue for a period of six months, such disability pension shall end and be terminated and can only be reinstated if the participant reapplies for a disability pension in accordance with this section. 
(Ord. No. 7669, 7/10/2013, § 3) 
Section 14. Termination of disability retirement benefit. 
A period of total disability ceases on the earliest of the following dates: 
A.  The date the participant ceases to be totally disabled; 
B.  The date the participant commences work at a reasonable occupation for which the employee may be engaged or may reasonably become engaged, fitted by education, training or experience; 
C.  The date the participant fails to furnish proof of the continuance of total disability or refuses to be examined when required; 
D.  The date the participant ceases to be under the care of a physician, or 
E.  The date of the participant's death. 
Section 15. Successive period of disability. 
Notwithstanding the fact that a participant may initially be determined disabled, and subsequently have disability retirement benefits terminated because of the occurrence of any event set forth in section 14 of this article, said participant may continue to be eligible for a successive period of disability benefits, if the participant is later determined disabled again as provided under section 13 of this article. The purpose of the successive disabilities rule is to encourage the participant to return to full-time work by assuring if the disability occurs again due to the same or related cause soon after returning to work, the participant will not have to complete a new qualifying period in order to qualify for benefits. 
Section 16. Definition of physician. 
The term "physician" means a legally qualified physician, except that with respect to a period of total disability, or any portion thereof, during which total disability is caused by any condition other than a medically determinable physical impairment, "physician" shall mean a legally qualified physician who either specializes in the practice of psychiatric medicine or has by reason of training or experience, a specialized competency in the field of psychiatric medicine sufficient to render the necessary evaluation and treatment of mental illness. To be "legally qualified," an individual must be licensed to practice medicine as a physician under the governing law of his state, territory, or foreign country, and said license must be issued by the respective medical board. In Georgia, the physician must be licensed to practice in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 43-34-1 et seq., as amended. 
(Ord. No. 7872, 3/9/2016, § 1) 
Section 17. Nonduplication of benefits. 
Nothing contained in this plan shall be construed as permitting any person to be entitled to more than one type of benefit under this plan or change the type of benefit elected once he has begun to receive benefit payments, unless otherwise specified in this plan. 
Section 18. Return to employment after retirement. 
A.  Reemployment. Any retirement benefit payable under this plan to any participant who has retired and commenced receiving benefits, shall be suspended as of the month in which he is reemployed as an eligible full-time employee or less than full-time employee if retired under the provisions of article V, section 11, by the employer. Benefits shall be resumed as of the first day of the month coinciding with or next following his subsequent retirement; said benefits shall be recalculated in accordance with this article on the basis of his aggregate credited service and final average earnings at the time of his subsequent retirement, but reduced on an actuarial basis by the value of any early retirement benefits received prior to being reemployed, provided that the resulting benefit shall not be less than the benefit payable at the time of this previous retirement. 
B.  Election or appointment to the governing authority. If a participant is elected or appointed as a member of the governing authority after he has retired from employment in another capacity under this plan, he shall be eligible to earn credited service, after he has met the participation requirements for elected or appointed officials, as set forth in section 1 of article III. He shall be eligible to receive a normal retirement benefit as an elected or appointed official provided he has met the requirements as set forth in section 1 of article V. During the period in which said participant is holding an elected or appointed office with the governing authority, he shall continue to receive retirement benefits previously awarded under the plan, however, such benefits shall not be recalculated as a result of his employment as an elected or appointed official. 
C.  Disability retirement. Any disability retirement benefit payable under this plan to any participant who shall have retired or been retired pursuant to any provision of section 2 of article V shall be suspended as of the date his disability ceases. In any case where the payment of a participant's disability retirement pension shall have been so suspended, said period of absence from employment due to such disability shall be treated as a leave of absence without pay, but shall not be counted toward future service. Any participant who shall have retired or been retired pursuant to the provisions of section 11 of article V and who does or who has been or shall be subsequently declared ineligible for a disability retirement benefit because of a cessation of said disability shall have a right to any benefit afforded under any other provision of this plan to which he might otherwise be entitled. In such a case any disability retirement payments made prior to the date his disability ceases or is declared to no longer exist shall be retained by the participant and disregarded in computing any other benefit payable under this plan. 
(Ord. No. 6284, 9/12/2001, § 2) 
ARTICLE VI  Crediting of Service and Break in Service 
Section 1. General. 
Service and credited service shall be granted to a participant for the purpose of determining such participant's vested percentage of his accrued benefit and for computing the amount of benefits payable under this plan. 
Section 2. Past service. 
A participant shall be entitled to receive past service and past credited service for the number of years and full months of continuous employment with the employer prior to November 1, 1973. Past service shall also be granted for any tenure of elected office of an elected or appointed member of the governing authority who was serving as an eligible employee or an elected or appointed official, or both, on November 1, 1973. Otherwise, past service shall not include any tenure of elective office as an elected or appointed member of the governing authority. 
Section 3. Future service. 
A participant shall earn future service and future credited service for the number of years and full months of continuous employment with the employer on and after November 1, 1973. 
Elective or appointed members of the governing authority shall earn future service and future credited service for all periods of elected office, whether or not successive, however any break in his tenure of elective office will not be considered as a period of future service or future credited service. 
Section 4. Break in service. 
A.  General rule. A participant will incur a break in service upon his termination of employment with the employer. A participant who is vested upon termination of employment shall be eligible for a vested retirement benefit in accordance with section 9 of article V. A participant who is not vested upon termination of employment shall lose his service and credited service. However, if the participant later returns to work with the employer and, after such rehire, earns the number of years of continuous service required to earn a vested percentage for the vesting period in effect on the date of rehire, then, except to the extent described in B below in the case of a participant who received a refund of his participant contributions, his previous years of service, prior to January 1, 2009, and credited service prior to January 1, 2009, for which he did not make participant contributions, shall be restored. 
B.  Participant received a refund of participant contributions. The rules set forth in this paragraph B shall apply to any participant who (1) has a termination of employment with the employer; (2) is rehired in a position in which he is or will be eligible to accrue a benefit under this plan; and (3) received, upon his original termination of employment, a refund of his participant contributions, pursuant to Article IV, Section 3(2). In such a case: 
1.  If the participant is rehired as of a date that is within sixty (60) months of his original termination of employment, and subsequently attains vested status according to the vesting requirements in place at the time of rehire, the participant shall, upon his rehire date and for purposes of calculating both his vested percentage and the amount of any benefit payable under this plan (i.e., both retirement and disability benefit), receive credit for fifty percent (50%) of the service with which the participant was credited during the period that he made participant contributions. 
2.  If the participant is rehired as of a date that is more than sixty (60) months after his original termination of employment, the participant shall not receive credit, for purposes of calculating the amount of any benefit payable under this plan, for the period of service earned during the period that he made participant contributions. Such a participant may, however, receive credit for vesting purposes under the rule set forth in Section 4.A above. 
(Ord. No. 7301, 3/11/2009, § 1) 
Section 5. Exceptions to break in service. 
An exception to the break in service provisions shall be allowed and a grace period granted if the participant's failure to earn service is due to: 
A.  An employee's absence from service by reasons of (1) her pregnancy, (2) birth of child of the employee, (3) placement of a child with the employee in connection with his or her adoption of the child, or (4) care for such child for a period beginning immediately after such birth or placement for reasons defined under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Such absence shall be credited as hours of employment up to the number of months allowed per incident pursuant to the FMLA. The time so credited shall be applied to the plan year in which such absence begins, if doing so will prevent the employee from incurring a break in service in that plan year; otherwise it shall be applied to the next plan year. FMLA may cover absences that are attributable to (1) the birth and care of the newborn child of the employee; (2) the placement with the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care; (3) the employee's care of an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition; or (4) the employee's medical leave when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition, or (5) other FMLA-covered reasons; 
B.  The employee's absence for the purpose of involuntary service in the Armed Forces of the United States; 
C.  Disability, for which the employee is receiving a disability retirement benefit; or 
D.  An authorized leave of absence, provided: 
1.  The individual was regularly employed by the employer immediately prior to his leave of absence; 
2.  The individual makes application for reemployment on or before the date of expiration of any leave of absence or within 90 days after he first becomes entitled to his discharge from military service; and 
3.  The individual is reemployed as an eligible employee within ninety (90) days after such application. 
(Ord. No. 7301, 3/11/2009, § 2) 
Section 6. Vesting. 
A participant hired prior to March 18, 2008, who is a full-time employee and who has completed at least five years of service shall have his credited service vested and the break in service rules as set forth in section 4 of this article shall not operate to deprive him of his accumulated service. 
A participant who is a full-time employee hired on or after March 18, 2008 through December 31, 2008, and who has completed at least seven years of credited service shall have his credited service vested and the break in service rules as set forth in section 4 of this article shall not operate to deprive him of his accumulated credited service. 
A participant who is a full-time employee hired on or after January 1, 2009, and who has completed at least ten years of credited service shall have his credited service vested and the break in service rules as set forth in section 4 of this article shall not operate to deprive him of his accumulated credited service. 
(Ord. No. 4905, 6/12/91, § 3; Ord. No. 6284, 9/12/2001, § 4; Ord. No. 7142, 3/17/2008, § 1; Ord. No. 7274, 12/10/2008, § 1) 
Section 7. Unused sick leave or military duty used in benefit calculation. 
New retirees will be credited with additional service for benefit calculation purposes only (i.e. this additional credit will not be used to satisfy any eligibility criteria for plan benefits) for either unused sick leave or for active duty federal military service prior to becoming an employee of the City of Marietta/BLW whichever is greater, to a maximum of one year. Unused sick leave or military service will be granted for whole months only. Unused sick leave will be verified by the city/BLW. Proof of military service will require evidence of an honorable discharge. This provision only applies to active employees who apply for normal or unreduced early retirement (if applicable) after the effective date of this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 6339, 12/12/2001, § 5) 
ARTICLE VII  Forms of Benefit Payment 
Section 1. Normal form of payment. 
The normal form of benefit payment shall be a single life benefit, payable monthly to the retired participant. Benefits will cease as of the month in which the participant's death occurs. 
Section 2. Election of optional retirement benefit. 
A participant may elect, or may revoke said election, at any time prior to his actual retirement date, to have his retirement benefit payable under the options hereinafter set forth, in lieu of the single life benefit he is otherwise entitled to receive. The benefit shall be paid in accordance with the terms of said option. Election of said option shall be made by the participant in writing. The amount of the optional retirement benefit shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of benefit that would otherwise be payable to the participant under article V. 
Any optional form of benefit elected by the participant must comply with the minimum distribution incidental benefit ("MDIB") requirement of proposed Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-2, or its successor. This rule ensures that the retirement benefits payable under the plan are more than incidental. If a participant designates a beneficiary or elects a form of benefit that would cause the payments to violate the MDIB rules, the pension board may, at its discretion, require the participant to designate another beneficiary or adjust the form of payment to satisfy such rules. 
(Ord. No. 6340, 12/12/2001, § 12) 
Section 3. Social Security option. 
A participant who retires from active service with a normal, early, or unreduced early retirement benefit as specified in Article V, Sections 1, 3, or 5, may elect this option and receive an increased retirement benefit payable to the participant during his lifetime until he is eligible for benefits commenced under O.A.S.D.I. and a decreased retirement benefit payable thereafter for life in order to have a more level retirement income when such decreased retirement benefit is added to his primary benefits under O.A.S.D.I. determined as of his retirement date; said benefit shall be computed in accordance with the factors set forth below. Upon the death of the participant, all payments will cease and no further benefits shall be payable. 
The factors set forth below shall be applied to the assumed O.A.S.D.I. benefit payable at the appropriate age. This amount shall then be added to the monthly retirement benefit determined in accordance with Article V of this plan. At the appropriate age, the same amount is then subtracted from the monthly retirement benefit. If, at the time of retirement, a calculation of the later monthly retirement benefit results in a negative balance, this option may not be elected. 
O.A.S.D.I. Benefits Paid at Age 

 
(Ord. No. 7966, 6/14/2017, § 1) 
Section 4. Joint and survivor benefit. 
A participant may elect to receive an actuarially reduced monthly retirement benefit with a continuation upon his death after retirement of 50%, 75% or 100% of his benefit, to that person he might name as his beneficiary, with the continuation of benefits being for the life of the beneficiary. 
The participant's monthly amount shall be a percentage of the full monthly amount otherwise payable as a single life benefit (after adjustment, of any, for early retirement) as follows: 
1.  50% joint and survivor option: 
a.  If the participant's pension is a nondisability retirement—The percentage shall be 88.0% plus 0.4% for each full year that the beneficiary is older than the participant or 88.0% minus 0.4% for each full year that the beneficiary is younger than the participant; 
b.  If the participant's pension is a disability pension—The percentage shall be 77.5% plus 0.4% for each full year that the beneficiary is older than the participant or 77.5% minus 0.4% for each full year that the beneficiary is younger than the participant; 
c.  In no event is the percentage to be greater than 99%; and 
2.  75% joint and survivor option: 
a.  If the participant's pension is a nondisability retirement—The percentage shall be 83.5% plus 0.5% for each full year that the beneficiary is older than the participant or 83.5% minus 0.5% for each full year that the beneficiary is younger than the participant; 
b.  If the participant's pension is a disability pension—The percentage shall be 70.0% plus 0.5% for each full year that the beneficiary is older than the participant or 70.0% minus 0.5% for each full year that the beneficiary is younger than the participant; 
c.  In no event is the percentage to be greater than 99%; and 
3.  100% joint and survivor option: 
a.  If the participant's pension is a nondisability retirement—The percentage shall be 79.0% plus 0.6% for each full year that the beneficiary is older than the participant or 79.0% minus 0.6% for each full year that the beneficiary is younger than the participant; 
b.  If the participant's pension is a disability pension—The percentage shall be 63.0% plus 0.6% for each full year that the beneficiary is older than the participant or 63.0% minus 0.6% for each full year that the beneficiary is younger than the participant; 
c.  In no event is the percentage to be greater than 99%. 
Section 5. Joint and survivor level benefit option. 
A participant may elect to receive the Social Security option (section 3 of this article) and a joint and survivor option (50%, 75% or 100%), (section 4 of this article), so that the participant will receive the increased retirement benefit until he is eligible for benefits to commence under O.A.S.D.I. and the decreased benefit payable thereafter for the remainder of his lifetime. Upon his death, the beneficiary will receive a percentage of the benefit the participant was receiving at the time of his death (50%, 75% or 100%, whichever the participant had elected). However, in the event the participant dies before benefits commence under O.A.S.D.I., the beneficiary will receive a percentage (as elected) of the benefit the participant was receiving at the time of his death until the date he would have been entitled to O.A.S.D.I. benefits, at which time the beneficiary will receive a percentage (as elected) of the benefit the participant would have received. 
This option may not be elected if the benefits payable under this plan after the participant commences to receive O.A.S.D.I. benefits, equal an amount less than zero. 
The participant's monthly benefit shall be determined as follows:

This "pop-up" adjustment shall be made the month following written notification to the plan of the beneficiary's death. Notification shall also include a certified copy of the death certificate of the beneficiary. This option is available to participants until the day before the beginning date of any plan year in which the provision of this option would result in an increase in the City/BLW's contribution to the pension plans. In which case, authorization for this option will cease and it will no longer be available to participants.

1.  50% joint and survivor option: 
a.  If the participant's pension is a nondisability retirement the percentage shall be 87.5%, plus 0.4% for each full year the beneficiary is older than the participant, or 87.5% minus 0.4% for each full year the beneficiary is younger than the participant. 
b.  If the participant's pension is a disability retirement the percentage shall be 77.0% plus 0.4% for each full year the beneficiary is older than the participant, or 77.0% minus 0.4% for each full year the beneficiary is younger than the participant. 
c.  In no event is the percentage to be greater than 99%; and 
2.  75% joint and survivor option: 
a.  If the participant's pension is a nondisability retirement the percentage shall be 82.9%, plus 0.5% for each full year the beneficiary is older than the participant, or 82.9% minus 0.5% for each full year the beneficiary is younger than the participant. 
b.  If the participant's pension is a disability retirement the percentage shall be 69.4% plus 0.5% for each full year the beneficiary is older than the participant, or 69.4% minus 0.5% for each full year the beneficiary is younger than the participant. 
c.  In no event is the percentage to be greater than 99%; and 
3.  100% joint and survivor option: 
a.  If the participant's pension is a nondisability retirement the percentage shall be 78.3%, plus 0.6% for each full year the beneficiary is older than the participant, or 78.3% minus 0.6% for each full year the beneficiary is younger than the participant. 
b.  If the participant's pension is a disability retirement the percentage shall be 62.3% plus 0.6% for each full year the beneficiary is older than the participant, or 62.3% minus 0.6% for each full year the beneficiary is younger than the participant.

ARTICLE VIII  Maximum Benefits [5] 
Section 8.01 General rule. 
The annual benefit payable under this plan to a participant at any time shall not exceed the maximum permissible amount under Code Section 415(b) and the regulations thereunder as applicable to governmental plans (as defined in Code Section 414(d)) and which are hereby incorporated by reference. "Maximum permissible amount" shall mean $160,000.00, as adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury for each calendar year, with the new limitation to apply to limitation years ending within the calendar year of the date of the adjustment (the "dollar limitation"). 
The limitation above is sometimes referred to herein as the "Code Section 415(b) limitation. 
Section 8.02 Reduction for less than ten years of participation or employment. 
If the annual benefit commences when the participant has less than ten years of participation in this plan or any predecessor plan to this plan, the dollar limitation shall be reduced by one-tenth for each year less than ten, but in no event shall be less than one-tenth of the unreduced dollar limitation. 
Section 8.03 Adjustment if the annual benefit commences before age 62 or after age 65. 
If the payment of benefits under this plan commences before age 62 or after age 65, the dollar limitation shall be adjusted as provided in this Section 10.03. The method for making this adjustment is not affected by whether the benefit is payable in a form subject to Code Section 417(e)(3). 
Generally, the age-adjusted dollar limitation is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation payable at age 65, as calculated under (a) or (b) below, whichever is applicable: 
(a)  If the Age at Which the Benefit is Payable is Less Than 62: The dollar limitation is determined by reducing the dollar limitation at age 65 on an actuarially equivalent basis. First, reduce the dollar limitation at age 65 using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factors, as applicable, which are set forth in the plan for the reduction of benefits for early commencement. Second, reduce the dollar limitation at age 65 using five percent interest and the applicable mortality table. Use the lesser of the amounts determined under the two preceding sentences as the age-adjusted dollar limitation under this paragraph (a). 
If the annuity starting date for the participant's benefit is prior to age 62 and occurs in a limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007, the defined benefit dollar limitation for the participant's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the participant's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limitation (adjusted for years of participation less than ten, if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount: (1) the interest rate specified in the plan and the mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the plan; or (2) a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table as defined in the plan. 
(i)  Plan Does Not Have Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at Both Age 62 and the Age of Benefit Commencement. If the annuity starting date for the participant's benefit is prior to age 62 and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement, the defined benefit dollar limitation for the participant's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the participant's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limitation (adjusted for years of participation less than ten, if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table for the annuity starting date as defined in the plan (and expressing the participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date). 
(ii)  Plan has Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at Both Age 62 and the Age of Benefit Commencement. If the annuity starting date for the participant's benefit is prior to age 62 and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the plan has an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit commencement, the dollar limitation for the participant's annuity starting date is the lesser of the limitation determined under subsection (i), and the dollar limitation (adjusted for years of participation less than ten, if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the participant's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age 62, both determined without applying the limitations of this section. 
(b)  If the Age at Which the Benefit is Payable is Later Than 65: The dollar limitation is determined by increasing the dollar limitation at age 65 on an actuarially equivalent basis. The increased age-adjusted dollar limitation shall be the lesser of the equivalent amount computed using the interest rate and mortality table set forth in article 1 in the definition of actuarial equivalence under the plan and the equivalent amount computed using five percent interest and the applicable mortality table. 
If the annuity starting date for the participant's benefit is after age 65 and occurs in a limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007, the dollar limitation for the participant's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the participant's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation (adjusted for years of participation less than ten, if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount: (1) the interest rate specified in the plan and the mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified the plan; or (2) a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table as defined in the plan. 
(i)  Plan Does Not Have Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at Both Age 65 and the Age of Benefit Commencement. If the annuity starting date for the participant's benefit is after age 65 and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement, the dollar limitation at the participant's annuity starting date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the participant's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation (adjusted for years of participation less than ten, if required), with actuarial equivalence computed using a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table for that annuity starting date as defined [in] the plan (and expressing the participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date). "(d) For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the actuarial adjustment is equal to the equivalent annual benefit, computed using (i) the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the plan; (ii) a 5.5 percent interest assumption and the applicable mortality table for distributions under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2); or (iii) the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) and the applicable mortality table for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) divided by 1.05. 
(ii)  Plan Has Immediately Commencing Straight Life Annuity Payable at Both Age 65 and the Age of Benefit Commencement. If the annuity starting date for the participant's benefit is after age 65 and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the plan has an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit commencement, the dollar limitation at the participant's annuity starting date is the lesser of the limitation determined under subsection (i) above, and the dollar limitation (adjusted for years of participation less than ten, if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the participant's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age 65, both determined without applying the limitations of this section. For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at the participant's annuity starting date is the annual amount of such annuity payable to the participant, computed disregarding the participant's accruals after age 65 but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan at age 65 is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under the plan to a hypothetical participant who is age 65 and has the same accrued benefit as the participant. 
Section 8.04 Special rules. 
(a)  All Plans a Single Plan. For purposes of the maximum limitations of this article, all defined benefit plans maintained by the employer shall be considered as a single defined benefit plan, and all defined contribution plans maintained by the employer shall be considered a single defined contribution plan. 
(b)  Special Limitation for Qualified Police or Firefighter. If a participant is a "qualified participant" as defined under Code Section 415(b)(2)(G), such Participant may retire before age 62, without a reduction in the dollar limitation if at least 15 years of service is required to receive a full benefit under the plan. 
(c)  Ancillary Benefits. "Ancillary benefits" i.e., benefits that are not directly related to retirement income benefits, or as otherwise defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(B), shall not count toward the dollar limitation. Such ancillary benefits include pre-retirement disability benefits and death benefits. 
Section 8.05 Definitions. 
For purposes of this Article 10, the following definitions shall apply: 
(a)  "Annual additions" means the sum of the following amounts credited to a participant's account under a defined contribution plan for the limitation year: 
(i)  Employer contributions; 
(ii)  Forfeitures; 
(iii)  Nondeductible employee contributions; provided, however, that the annual addition for any limitation year beginning before January 1, 1987 shall not be recomputed to treat nondeductible employee contributions as an annual addition; and 
(iv)  Amounts described in Code Sections 415(l)(1) and 419A(d)(2). 
(b)  "Annual benefit" means a retirement benefit under the plan which is payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity. If a participant's benefit is payable in a non-annuity benefit form, whether as the normal form of benefit or as an optional form which the participant or his beneficiary elects, the non-annuity benefit form is adjusted as provided below, whichever is applicable. No actuarial adjustment to the non-annuity benefit form is required for (i) the value of a qualified joint and survivor annuity; (ii) the value of benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a disability benefit, pre-retirement death benefits, and post-retirement medical benefits); or (iii) the value of post-retirement cost-of-living increases made in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
(i)  Conversion for optional forms subject to Code Section 417(c)(3). For purposes of applying the maximum permissible amount, retirement benefits payable in an optional form other than a straight life annuity, which are subject to Code Section 417(c)(3) are adjusted to an actuarially equivalent straight life annuity that is equal to the greater of the equivalent annual benefit, computed using the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the plan and the equivalent annual benefit computed using the applicable mortality table under Rev. Rul. 2001-62. 
(ii)  Conversion for optional forms not subject to Code Section 417(c)(3). For purposes of applying the maximum permissible amount, retirement benefits payable in an optional form other than a straight life annuity, which are not subject to Code Section 417(c)(3) are adjusted to an actuarially equivalent straight life annuity that equals: 
(A)  For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the greater of the annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable under the plan at the same annuity starting date, and the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the participant's form of benefit computed using an interest rate of five percent and the applicable mortality table under Code Section 417(e)(3). For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the actuarial adjustment is equal to the equivalent annual benefit, computed using (i) the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the plan; (ii) a 5.5-percent interest assumption and the applicable mortality table for distributions under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2); or (iii) the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) and the applicable mortality table for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) divided by 1.05. 
(B)  For limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007, the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the participant's form of benefit computed using whichever of the following produces the greater annual amount: (I) the interest rate and mortality table or other tabular factor specified in the plan for adjusting benefits in the same form and (II) a five-percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table described in Code Section 417(e)(3). 
(c)  "Compensation" means a participant's earned income, wages, salaries, and fees for professional services, and other amounts received for personal services actually rendered in the course of employment with the employer (including, but not limited to, commissions paid sales representatives, compensation for services on the basis of a percentage of profits, commissions on insurance premiums, tips and bonuses), and excluding the following: 
(i)  Employer contributions to a plan of deferred compensation that are not included in the employee's gross income for the taxable year in which contributed or employer contributions under a simplified employee pension plan to the extent such contributions are deductible by the employee, or any distributions from a plan of deferred compensation; 
(ii)  Amounts realized from the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, or when restricted stock (or property) held by the employee either becomes freely transferable or is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture; 
(iii)  Amounts realized from the sale, exchange or other disposition of stock acquired under a qualified stock option; 
(iv)  Other amounts which receive special tax benefits; and 
(v)  Amounts that do not satisfy the timing rules set forth in the Regulations under Code Section 415. 
Compensation for any limitation year is the compensation actually paid or includable in gross income during such year. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, compensation shall include any elective deferral (as defined in Code Section 402(g)(3)) and any amount that is contributed or deferred by the employer at the election of the employee and which is not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 125 or 457. In addition, compensation shall be increased by the amount by which the participant's compensation is reduced by salary reduction or similar arrangement under Section 132(f)(4) of the Code (i.e., a qualified transportation fringe benefit program). 
The annual compensation taken into account shall not exceed the limitations of Code Section 401(a)(17) in effect as of the beginning of the plan year in which it is paid. 
(d)  Amounts that would otherwise constitute "compensation" under (c) above but are paid from a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan sponsored by the employer nevertheless shall constitute "compensation" for purposes of the limitations in Code Section 415 in the year in which such amounts are actually received by the participant, but only to the extent such amounts are includible in the participant's gross income. 
(e)  The following amounts also shall constitute "compensation" under (c) above if (i) the amounts are paid by the later of two and one-half months after the participant's severance from employment with the employer or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the participant's severance from employment, and (ii) the amounts would have constitute compensation under [Subsection](c) above if they were paid prior to the participant's severance from employment with the employer: 
(i)  Payment for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave, but only if the participant would have been able to use the leave if employment had continued; and 
(ii)  Amounts received by a participant pursuant to a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan, but only if the payment would have been paid to the participant at the same time if the participant had continued in employment with the employer and only to the extent that the payment is includible in the participant's gross income. 
Section 8.06 General rule. 
Anything contained in the plan to the contrary notwithstanding, effective January 1, 2014, an accrued benefit computed under Article 10 shall be limited to the maximum permissible amount under Code Section 415(b) and the regulations thereunder, as applicable to a governmental plan (as defined in Code Section 414(d)), which are hereby incorporated by reference.

A.  Reduce the accrued benefits of any employee participant or employee beneficiary as defined in Article III, Section 1, however, expressly an amendment may reduce or add benefits to elected or appointed members and applicable beneficiaries of the governing body from time to time as provisions under the city pension plan vary between employee and elected officials with the effective date being January 8, 2014, or

Section 2. Termination of the plan.

Any participant or beneficiary receiving or claiming benefits under the plan shall be conclusively presumed to be mentally competent and of age until the pension board receives a written notice, in a form and manner acceptable to it, that such person is incompetent or a minor, and that a guardian or other person legally vested with the care of his estate has been appointed. In the event that the pension board finds that any person to whom a benefit is payable under the plan is unable to properly care for his affairs, or is a minor, then any payment due (unless a prior claim therefor shall have been made by a duly appointed legal representative) may be paid to the spouse, a child; a parent, or a brother or sister, or to any person deemed by the pension board to have incurred expense for such person otherwise entitled to payment. In the event a guardian of the estate of any person receiving or claiming benefits under the plan shall be appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction, payments shall be made to such guardian provided that proper proof of appointment is furnished in a form and manner suitable to the pension board. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of liability therefor under the plan. 
Section 4. Benefits supported only by trust fund.

5-6-060 - Requirements for small wireless facilities in the right-of-way. 
A.  All small wireless facilities shall require an attachment agreement or other authorization for placement on the pole or wireless support structure and shall be subject to the following requirements, except that any small wireless facility proposed to be located in a protected area, as identified on the map described in Subsection B., shall comply with the requirements of that section to the extent they differ from the requirement below: 
1.  For any SWF proposed to be located on any pole other than a city-approved pole, the WIP shall be required to replace the existing pole with a city-approved pole unless such replacement is shown to be impractical under the circumstances; the city shall have the authority to determine whether replacement is impractical, and if that determination is made, the city shall have the right to require placement of the proposed small wireless facilities in such a manner as to minimize its impacts to the right-of-way, including conditions intended to ensure the safety of its citizens and to protect aesthetics of the surrounding area. 
2.  Installations in/on utility poles not located within protected areas shall be limited to in-line tangent poles without transformers and those classified as secondary service poles. 
3.  To the greatest extent practical, antennas shall not be perceptible by an average person from 250 feet away; if a dispute arises as to this paragraph, the public works director will make the final determination as to compliance with this paragraph. 
4.  Small wireless facility installations on all poles shall utilize a concealed design, with all cabling being inside a hollow pole or otherwise hidden from view without banding or external conduit or panduit. 
5.  All radios, network equipment and batteries will be enclosed inside the pole or on the pole inside a concealment device approved by the city public works department). 
6.  Small wireless facilities are not permitted on poles with traffic lights or poles that are identified as sign poles. 
7.  Small wireless facilities shall not be permitted at signalized intersections of city-owned rights-of-way. 
8.  All SWF shall be designed in a manner that does not endanger public safety or impede traffic flow on roads and sidewalks. 
9.  Any new poles installed shall not leach any volatile organic compounds or toxic materials. 
10.  Any new poles installed should be constructed in a manner to avoid unsightly rust and corrosion. The finish on the pole should conform to city standards, including selection of color, finish method, such as "baked on" or color that is tightly integrated into the material composition of the pole to prevent color fading or erosion or peeling of paint from the exterior of the pole. 
11.  Any SWF placed on a city-owned pole shall not interfere with or block any banners or other attachments owned by the city. The small wireless facility shall be aesthetically compatible with the surrounding area through application of camouflage and concealment design techniques. 
12.  Any new, modified, or replacement pole or wireless support structure installed in the rights-of-way located outside of a protected area shall not exceed five feet above the tallest pre-existing poles or wireless support structures within 200 feet of the proposed new wireless facility, located on the same side of the street and within the same right-of-way, except that no pole shall exceed 65 feet above ground level (AGL). 
13.  Any poles located in protected areas or streetscaped corridors, shall be consistent in height with the other decorative poles located therein. The city shall not allow new poles in any protected area without a variance from city council, and any replacement poles must match the height of the existing pole it replaces. 
14.  Applicant shall comply with all requirements set forth in the city's underground utility ordinance. 
15.  Any small wireless facilities proposed to be located with 250 feet of another small wireless facility shall be collocated with other small wireless facilities or neutrally hosted, unless applicant provides sufficient evidence that coverage and capacity needs cannot be met using collocated or neutrally hosted wireless attachments; any small wireless facilities shall be designed and constructed in a manner that allows other competing wireless infrastructure providers and carriers to be collocated on/in the same pole or placed on/in nearby poles. It is the express intent of this chapter that in areas where one WIP has installed SWF, all providers and carriers be shall permitted to install SWF in the same area consistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, including 47 U.S. Code § 224, and other applicable provisions. To the extent such collocation or nearby placement is not feasible in certain rights-of-way, all wireless infrastructure providers shall be prohibited from installing SWF in that area of the right-of-way, and the public works department has authority to deny or revoke any permits for SWF in that area if it is shown that WIP are being blocked by competing WIP from locating there. As SWF technology continues to develop and smaller and more concealed designs are available, the city may review permits and require that WIP upgrade older SWF so that more WIP may collocate and/or decrease the footprint of SWF in the rights-of-way. 
B.  Protected Areas. 
1.  The city council may designate certain areas of the city in which utilities have been placed underground, or in which streetscaping, historic preservation, or other considerations require the design and construction of small wireless facilities in a manner that conforms to the existing aesthetic and structural schemes. 
2.  The protected areas are identified on the protected area maps included with this chapter and adopted concurrently herewith. The city council may update the protected area maps as additional areas within the city are designated as protected areas. The public works department shall maintain a corresponding list of city-approved pole(s) for each protected area identified on the map. 
3.  Small wireless facilities located in protected areas with existing decorative poles shall use poles that conform to the height and aesthetics of the existing decorative poles. The public works department shall maintain a list of city-approved poles for each protected area and a list of design specifications for SWF placed in each protected area, including height limits, equipment placement, and concealment requirements. 
4.  Where SWFs are not prohibited, any poles located in protected areas or streetscaped corridors shall be consistent in height with the other decorative poles located therein. The city shall not allow new poles in any protected area without a variance from city council, and any replacement poles must match the height of the existing pole it replaces. 
5.  Pole-mounted cabinets approved by the city in protected areas shall conform to the design and placement specifications determined by the public works department for each protected area and cabinets on the ground are prohibited altogether in protected areas. 
6.  Where the city has or hereafter decides to relocate utility facilities underground or replace poles with decorative poles, the city shall designate such area as a protected area and shall attempt to work with the wireless infrastructure provider to accommodate placement of SWF on city-approved poles within that area provided the SWF conform to poles used in the area. Once a new protected area has been designated, WIP, at its expense, shall remove the small wireless facilities and may apply for a permit for any new SWF. Once utilities have been moved underground and SWF have been removed pursuant to this subsection WIP may not place SWF and associate equipment back into the right-of-way without a variance from city council. 
(Ord. No. 8001, 1/10/2018, § 1) 
5-6-070 - Effect of permit and construction requirements. 
A.  Authority Granted: No Property Right or Other Interest Created. A permit from the city authorizes an applicant to undertake only certain activities in accordance with this chapter, and does not create a property right or grant any authority whatsoever to the applicant to impinge upon the rights of others who may already have an interest in the rights-of-way. 
B.  Duration. Unless construction has actually begun and is diligently pursued to completion at that point, no permit for construction issued under this chapter shall be valid for a period longer than 12 months unless both city and applicant agree to a reasonable extension and all required fees are paid for the term regardless of construction. 
C.  Public Safety and Traffic. Construction and maintenance of SWF shall be performed in a manner that does not endanger public safety and that minimizes interference with traffic flow. Where permittee must disrupt traffic flow, appropriate safety and traffic flow measures shall be employed to safeguard against accidents and keep traffic moving in an efficient manner. 
D.  Condition of Right-of-Way. Upon completion of any construction or maintenance of its small wireless facilities, the wireless infrastructure provider must return the surface of the city's right-of-way to its prior condition, including any sidewalks, curbing, paving, landscaping or other improvements in place prior to the construction. WIP shall not leave sidewalks in an uneven condition and shall use similar materials and construction in its repair of the right-of-way such that the appearance of the improvements is substantially identical to its prior condition. If the right-of-way is not returned to a substantially identical condition after construction or maintenance activities, the city may, in its sole discretion, request the WIP to make the appropriate repairs within five days of receiving notice from the city. If the repairs are not made by the WIP within said time, the city may perform the repairs on its own and require reimbursement of any expenses associated therewith. When such repairs are made by the city, written notice shall be sent requesting reimbursement upon completion of the repairs, and WIP shall have 30 days to reimburse such expenses from the sending of the notice. 
E.  Construction and Maintenance Exclusions. The city retains the authority to exclude certain days, holidays and special events periods during which the wireless infrastructure provider may not perform construction or maintenance activities on its small wireless facilities and must be out of the rights-of-way. The public works department may also require that WIP and their agents not perform construction or maintenance work during certain times of the day in order to lessen the impact on traffic or otherwise address safety concerns. Such times shall be as approved by the city council or the public works director. Prior to commencing construction or maintenance, permittee or its agent must verify that its planned work does not fall into an excluded time period. 
F.  Compliance with ADA. Any small wireless facilities or associated construction and maintenance activities must comply with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) (29 U.S.C. § 794) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) (42 U.S.C. §§ 12131—12164). The city shall not be liable for any small wireless facilities or any actions of the WIP which violate the ADA. If at any time the city determines the right-of-way is not in compliance due to the actions or facilities of WIP, the city may, in its sole discretion, request the WIP to make the appropriate repairs within five days of sending of the notice from the city. If the repairs are not made by the WIP, the city may perform the repairs on its own and require reimbursement of any expenses associated therewith. When such repairs are made by the city, written notice shall be sent requesting reimbursement upon completion of the repairs, and WIP shall have 30 days to reimburse such expenses from the sending of the notice. 
(Ord. No. 8001, 1/10/2018, § 1) 
5-6-080 - Attachment to city-owned or utility-owned poles in the ROW. 
A permit issued under this article does not confer any right to attach small wireless facilities, wireless attachments, or ancillary equipment, or to remove or replace any city, utility or privately-owned pole with a small wireless facility without having an attachment agreement or other authorization from the owner of the pole or wireless support structure. The city may cause a permit for wireless attachments to a city-owned structure under this article to be made conditional upon the execution of a finalized attachment agreement. Any removed and replaced pole must conform to city-approved pole. 
Make Ready. For city-owned poles in the rights-of-way, the city shall provide a good faith estimate for any make-ready work necessary to install the requested small wireless facility, including pole replacement and if necessary, a new pole or enable the existing pole to support collocated wireless attachments and ancillary equipment within 30 days after receipt of a completed request. Make-ready work including any pole replacement shall be completed within 60 days of written acceptance of the good faith estimate by the wireless infrastructure provider. 
Cease Payment. A wireless infrastructure provider is authorized to remove its wireless attachment and ancillary equipment from a pole upon 90 days' written notice to the city and cease paying the annual rate to the city. 
(Ord. No. 8001, 1/10/2018, § 1) 
5-6-090 - Removal, relocation or modification of a small wireless facility in the ROW. 
A.  General Relocation Policy. 
1.  In the interest of the public health, safety and welfare, consistent with the city's ordinances and master plans, and in the reasonable exercise of its police powers, the city may make or cause to be made improvements, repairs, or replacements of the public facilities located on public rights-of-way. Such construction activity may require adjustment or relocation of installations of public utilities, and small wireless facilities owned and maintained by wireless service providers. The city deems the right of public utilities to use public rights-of-way to be permissive and subordinate to the reasonable exercise of the city's police power. Thus, the cost of relocating a small wireless facility installation when the city reasonably exercises its police power shall be borne by the wireless infrastructure provider. In such instances, the city shall work in good faith with the wireless providers to identify and provide suitable alternative locations for the placement of the removed wireless facilities if available and consistent with this chapter. In areas designated by the city as protected areas the city may decline to provide alternative locations for placement of SWF that are removed in order to promote the city's protection of that corridor. 
2.  Whenever the city determines that relocation of a SWF is necessary under this provision, the city shall give WIP 60 days' notice within which to relocate or otherwise remove the SWF. Should the wireless infrastructure provider not relocate as directed by the city, the city may disconnect and remove the wireless attachment, ancillary equipment or the entire small wireless facility at the wireless infrastructure provider's expense. When such removal is performed by the city, written notice shall be sent requesting reimbursement after completion of the removal, and WIP shall have 30 days to reimburse such expenses after the sending of the notice. Failure to timely reimburse shall terminate right to be in city ROW. 
B.  Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities. The city retains the right to cut or move or disconnect any small wireless facility located within its rights-of-way as the city, in its sole discretion, may determine to be necessary, appropriate, or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the city shall notify the wireless infrastructure provider and provide it an opportunity to move its own small wireless facility, prior to the city cutting or removing such facility and the city shall notify the wireless infrastructure provider after cutting or removing the small wireless facility. The city shall not be liable for any damages to small wireless facilities or other infrastructure that is cut or removed during such emergencies. When such removal is performed by the city, written notice shall be sent requesting reimbursement after completion of the removal, and WIP shall have 30 days to reimburse such expenses after the sending of the notice. 
(Ord. No. 8001, 1/10/2018, § 1) 
5-6-100 - Change of law. 
A permit for the placement of small wireless facilities within the city rights-of-way may include a provision reasonably addressing the obligations of the parties if there is a substantial change of law at the federal, state, or local level. 
(Ord. No. 8001, 1/10/2018, § 1) 
5-6-110 - Periodic review. 
The city may, in its sole discretion, review the terms and conditions of any permit issued pursuant to this chapter after five years to determine if the terms and conditions for the use of city rights-of-way are still in the best interests of the city pursuant to the laws and regulations in effect at the time. If it is determined by the city that the terms and conditions of the permit are no longer in the best interest of the city under the terms of this chapter, it may revoke the permit or may make changes to the permit as necessary to meet the best interests of the city. 
(Ord. No. 8001, 1/10/2018, § 1) 
5-6-120 - Fees and rentals. 
The following fee schedule establishes the fees and an annual payment or lease of city rights-of-way for small wireless facilities as follows: 
1.  Application Fees. Except as otherwise provided by Subsection 2., all applications for permits pursuant to this chapter shall be accompanied by a fee for actual, direct, and reasonable costs incurred by the city related to processing the application, but shall not exceed $250.00 each for up to five identical or similar small wireless facilities addressed in the application and $100.00 for each additional application for similar small wireless facilities. 
2.  Asset Contribution. Anytime a city-owned pole is used for placement of an SWF, wireless infrastructure provider shall, at no cost to the city, to contribute a city-approved pole for each small wireless facility for which the city requires the installation of a new pole or replacement of a city-owned pole. As consideration, the city shall waive the application fee, and shall grant the wireless infrastructure provider the right to install the authorized small wireless facility at each contributed pole, subject to the other provisions of the chapter, including but not limited to periodic review pursuant to Section 5-6-110. 
3.  Use of Right-of-Way City Property Rental Rates. A wireless provider authorized to place small wireless facilities in the rights-of-way shall pay to the city compensation for use of the rights-of-way in the amount of $250.00 annually per small wireless facility. In addition, an annual right-of-way mitigation fee of $200.00 per small wireless facility shall be assessed and placed in a separate fund set aside for the purpose for mitigating visual and aesthetic damages caused to the city's rights-of-way. 
4.  Annual Rate for City. The annual rate to attach or collocate a small wireless facility on a city-owned pole shall be $900.00 per year for each installed small wireless facility. Such compensation together with the application fee or asset contribution, and the rights-of-way fee specified in this chapter shall be the sole compensation that the wireless infrastructure provider shall be required to pay the city or utility; provided, if the wireless infrastructure provider is also installing its own fiber optic technology to a particular location, the wireless infrastructure provider shall also provide the city with an opportunity to lay conduit and/or fiber for city use, at the city's expense, to the aforementioned location utilizing any open trenching or boring construction by the wireless infrastructure provider during the wireless infrastructure provider's installation, including stubbing up the conduit within the city-approved pole. 
5.  Right of Wireless Provider to Cease Payment. A wireless infrastructure provider is authorized to remove its wireless attachments and ancillary equipment at any time from the pole in the rights-of-way or other wireless support structure and may cease paying the city compensation for use of the rights-of-way as of the next due date for payment following the removal if all equipment is removed.

(Ord. No. 7683, 9/11/2013, § 1) 
5-17-020 - Policy overview. 
The objective of the City of Marietta Speed Table Ordinance is to provide a process whereby residential street(s) may obtain speed tables on residential streets with a maximum posted speed limit of 25 miles per hour. Alternate traffic calming devices are available and may be considered separately or as part of this process. To qualify for the installation of speed tables, areas affected streets must meet all requirements set forth in this policy. 
(Ord. No. 7683, 9/11/2013, § 1) 
5-17-030 - Requirements for study. 
A.  The following criteria must be met before a residential street is studied for possible speed table installation: 
1.  Residential Street. The City of Marietta must confirm that the requested street is identified as a residential street(s) with a maximum posted speed limit of 25 miles per hour. In addition, the requested street(s) must be suitable for speed table installation and must have suitable speed table locations having grades eight percent or less. 
2.  Written Request. The City of Marietta must receive a written request from a resident (or residents) of a particular residential street(s) asking that their street(s) be studied to determine if it qualifies for the installation of speed tables. The address of the resident making such request will be verified using the same procedures used for rezoning requests. 
Residential streets meeting the above criteria are added to the City of Marietta list for speed table study purposes. 
(Ord. No. 7683, 9/11/2013, § 1) 
5-17-040 - Validate speed and volume requirements. 
Upon authorization by city council, a speed table request will be evaluated based upon the following study criteria. The following requirements have been established in determining if streets qualify for study regarding the possible installation of speed tables: 
Traffic data will be collected from selected residential street to determine the ninety-fifth percentile speed and the ADT. If the ninety-fifth percentile speed is five miles per hour or more over the posted speed limit, and the ADT is between 300 and 3,000 vehicles, the residential street qualifies for a public meeting. 
(Ord. No. 7683, 9/11/2013, § 1) 
5-17-050 - Public meeting. 
For all study areas that meet the previous requirements, a public meeting shall be held. Public meetings are held in order to provide speed table study area residents with relevant information prior to city council public hearing. 
Prior to public meetings, public works shall mark the proposed speed table location(s) on the residential street(s) within three feet of the final location(s) and shall subsequently verify that the resident(s) of property fronting the speed hump location(s) agree with the proposed location(s). In the event that no suitable speed table location(s) can be agreed upon by public works and the resident(s) fronting the location(s), the matter will be brought forward to council for consideration prior to further action. 
Notices of the public meetings will be posted a minimum of 14 days prior to each meeting. Signs advertising the public meeting(s) will be provided and installed by the public works department. Signs will be clearly legible to traffic traveling in each direction near each end of the road section being considered for speed tables. Public meetings consist of a short presentation, followed by a question and comment session. The purpose of the public meeting is to provide reasonable accommodation for input from residents and others that may use the residential street(s) to access their lots. 
(Ord. No. 7683, 9/11/2013, § 1) 
5-17-060 - Public hearing before city council. 
A public hearing shall be held to determine whether speed tables shall be installed on a residential street. Notice of public hearings shall follow the procedures in use at the time for providing notice for rezoning matters. Public hearings before the council will be conducted only for those locations that qualify for consideration under this policy. After the conclusion of the public hearing, the city council may then vote to approve/disapprove installation of speed tables in the study. 
Petitions are not required as part of this process and are optional. If a petition(s) is submitted, the attached petition form shall be used. 
The most recent street asphalt ratings relative to resurfacing will be provided to the council for those street(s) where speed tables are proposed. In addition, emergency service providers (police, fire, and ambulance) will be requested to provide information to the council related to the effects of installing speed tables in the requested study area. 
A map will be provided to council showing properties with no alternate route to an arterial street less than 125 percent of the shortest route to an arterial street requiring travel over the affected street. 
(Ord. No. 7683, 9/11/2013, § 1) 
5-17-070 - Speed table design standards. 
The geometric design of speed tables is a crucial factor in their effectiveness. City of Marietta speed tables will be constructed per the following specifications: 
A.  Vertical Height. Three inches. A tolerance for minor height differences due to construction variations shall be permitted. Speed tables constructed following this ordinance greater than three and one-half inches in height shall be modified or reconstructed to reduce the height to between three and three and one-half inches. 
B.  Horizontal Length. Twenty-two feet (consisting of an incline of six feet; a plateau of ten feet in length; and a decline of six feet.) 
C.  Spacing/Placement. In order to be effective, speed tables are typically installed in a series. Spacing between tables will vary between a minimum spacing of 300 feet and a maximum spacing of 800 feet or as recommended by public works. Minor changes in the proposed speed table location up to three feet may be considered prior to installation of the speed tables based upon residents' concerns and the engineering feasibility to make such modifications. 
D.  Signs/Pavement Markings. Speed tables will be identified in accordance with the minimum signing and pavement marking standards in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, latest edition. In cases where special safety circumstances exist, public works may authorize signing and pavement marking exceeding the minimum standards set forth in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 
(Ord. No. 7683, 9/11/2013, § 1) 
5-17-080 - Installation of speed tables. 
Speed tables may be funded by the City of Marietta. Donations for speed tables may be considered by city council. Installation of speed tables will be performed by either city staff, or by a private contractor, contracted by the city. Installation of speed tables will not be considered final until the public works department inspects the tables for compliance with design standards set forth in this policy. 
(Ord. No. 7683, 9/11/2013, § 1) 
5-17-090 - Repeated requests. 
In the case where a request fails as a result of failing to meet the required criteria or lack of affirmative vote by city, that street(s) must wait a minimum of two years from the start date of the original request in order to make a subsequent request, unless special circumstances have had a noticeable effect on the study criteria outlined in this policy. Repeat requests must be in writing and meet the same requirements detailed in this chapter for original requests. The process will be identical to a new request and will begin with the initial phases outlined in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 7683, 9/11/2013, § 1) 
5-17-110 - Removal process. 
Written request(s) for removal of a speed table can only be made after the speed table has been installed for a minimum of two years. In the event that a resident(s) desires the removal of speed tables from a street which they live upon, written request from a resident(s) of a particular residential street asking that speed tables be removed from a street must be made in writing to the public works department. It shall be verified the request is from a resident(s) who lives on the residential street(s), as verified by the same process used for rezoning requests. Once the requestor has been verified as a resident of the affected street, a notice of public hearing shall be posted. Notice of public hearing may follow the procedures in use at the time for providing notice for rezoning matters. After the conclusion of the public hearing, the city council may then vote to approve/disapprove removal of speed tables in the study. Speed tables will not be removed unless approved by the city council. City of Marietta reserves the right to remove speed tables for any reason. 
(Ord. No. 7683, 9/11/2013, § 1) 
5-17-120 - Variance procedure. 
The city council, at its sole discretion, may vary from the procedures or standards set forth herein for any reason. 
Additionally, a resident of an affected street may request, in writing, that the city council grant a variance from the procedures or standards set forth in Sections 5-17-020—5-17-090 of this chapter. Once a written variance request is filed with the city, the city shall hold a public hearing to determine whether the variance should be granted. Notice of variance hearings shall follow the procedures in use at the time for providing notice for rezoning matters. After the conclusion of the variance hearing, the city council may then vote to approve/disapprove installation of speed tables in the study at its sole discretion. The city council will not consider written variance requests seeking to vary the procedures or standards for the removal process in Section 5-17-110 of this chapter.

CHAPTER 6-20 - CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL 

6-20-010 - Findings and purpose. 
The City of Marietta finds it necessary and desirable, for the protection of the public health and welfare, to prevent the entry of contaminants or pollutants into any area of the potable water supply through the control of cross connections (a cross connection being defined as a physical connection between two otherwise separate piping systems or vessels one of which contains potable water and the other does not). The city finds that the optimum control may be accomplished by isolating potential sources of contaminants or pollutants on the customer's premises and protecting the public supply at the point of delivery to the customer's premises. The provisions of this cross connection control ordinance are applicable to any system to which water is supplied by the public distribution system including sprinkler and fire protection systems and residential systems.

6-20-070 - Selection, approval and installation of devices. 
A.  Selection. Vacuum breakers and backflow preventers shall be selected on the degree of hazard and the type cross connection. The degrees of hazard are determined by whether the impurities involved are contaminants or pollutants; the type cross connection by whether it is non-pressure or pressure (see definitions section). 
1.  Cross Connections, Non-pressure Type. This type connection, when not protected by a minimum air gap, shall be protected by an appropriate vacuum breaker or an appropriate backflow preventer. 
2.  Cross Connection, Pressure Type. This type connection shall be protected by an appropriate backflow preventer only. 
Caution: Neither atmospheric nor pressure type vacuum breakers shall be used on pressure type cross connections. 
3.  [Lawn Sprinkler System.] Note: Because a lawn sprinkler system serves an environment that is open to atmosphere, it is not classified as a pressure type cross connection. Due to the special nature of the installation, however, it is recommended that if no chemicals are injected into the system, minimum protection against backflow shall include a double check valve assembly. If chemicals could be injected easily, minimum protection shall include a reduced pressure zone type back flow preventer. 
4.  Accepted Materials. Vacuum breakers shall be bronze. Backflow preventers, including accessories, components, and fittings in size 2-inch and smaller shall be bronze with threaded connections. Size 2½-inches and larger may be iron or bronze bodies, with flanged connections. 
B.  Approval of Devices. All vacuum breakers and backflow preventers must be approved by the BLW in accordance with the applicable standards of the American Society of Sanitary Engineering, the American National Standards Institute, the American Water Works Association, or the University of Southern California. 
C.  Installation of Devices. Vacuum breakers and backflow preventers equipped with atmospheric vents, or with relief openings, shall be so installed by the customer and so located as to prevent any vent or any relief opening from being submerged. They shall be installed in the position as recommended by the manufacturer, and shall be protected from freezing. 
1.  Vacuum Breaker, Atmospheric Type (VB-AT). This device shall be installed at least six inches above the highest outlet or the overflow level on the nonpotable system. It shall be installed downstream of the last shut-off valve. 
2.  Vacuum Breaker, Pressure Type (VB-PT). This device shall be installed at least twelve (12) inches above the highest outlet or the overflow level on the nonpotable system. It may be installed upstream of the last shut-off valve. 
3.  Vacuum Breaker, Hose Type (VB-HT). This device shall be installed directly on the hose threads, if not an integral part of the valve. It may not be subjected to continuous pressure, static or flowing. Nor shall it be attached to a freezeless type hydrant unless it is a model specifically designed for this service. 
4.  Backflow Preventer, Dual Check (BFP-DuC). This device shall not be buried in earth but may be installed below ground in such as a meter box. A positive shut-off valve shall be near the inlet side of the device; when below ground, near both sides. 
5.  Backflow Preventer, Double Check Valve (BFP-DCV). This device shall not be buried in earth but may be installed below ground in a pit provided ball valve test cocks fitted with brass plugs are used. A positive shut-off valve shall be near the inlet and outlet sides of the device, and three ball valve test cocks provided on the device. A fourth test cock shall be provided on the upstream side of the inlet shut-off valve. When below ground, a union or flange shall be near the inlet and outlet sides. No intervening connection(s) shall be between the shutoff valves and the backflow preventer. 
6.  Backflow Preventer with Intermediate Atmospheric Vent (BFP-IAV). This device shall not be installed below ground. Where relief valve discharge could cause water damage, it shall be piped via an air gap, or a funnel, at the vent/relief port to a floor drain or other approved location. A positive shutoff valve and union shall be near the inlet and outlet sides of the device. A bronze strainer with 20-mesh stainless steel screen shall be included between the inlet shut-off valve and the device. 
7.  Backflow Preventer Reduced Pressure Zone (BFP-RPZ). 
a.  This device shall not be installed below ground. Where relief valve discharge could cause water damage, it shall be piped via an air gap, or a funnel, at the vent/relief port to a floor drain or other approved location. A positive shut-off valve shall be near the inlet and outlet sides of the device, and three approved test cocks provided on the device. A fourth test cock shall be provided on the upstream side of the inlet shut-off valve. A bronze strainer with 20-mesh stainless steel screen shall be included between the inlet shut-off valve and the device on sizes through 2-inch. No intervening branch connection(s) shall be between the shut-offs and the backflow preventer. When the reduced pressure zone device is installed in a line subject to periodic no-flow conditions, and supply pressure subject to fluctuations, an auxiliary directional check with soft disc, capable of functioning in any position the BFP might be installed in, shall be provided between the inlet shut-off valve and the BFP head to lock the supply pressure in, and prevent unnecessary discharge through the vent/relief port. Make-up lines to chilled water systems are examples of installations where a drop in supply pressure might occur during no-flow conditions. 
b.  When a water pressure reducing valve is required in the same line with the RPZ device, it is usually possible to locate the reducing valve upstream of the device and take advantage of the check valve effect of the reducing valve. In such case, the auxiliary directional check would not be required.

(Code 1978, § 5-5012; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96) 
6-20-130 - Explanation of devices commonly used. 
The purpose of certain checking devices currently used, or likely to be used, with fire protection systems is outlined to call attention to those devices approved for cross connection control and those not approved: 
A.  Directional Check. To provide directional flow only (not cross connection control). 
B.  Alarm Check. To signal an alarm, to summon the fire department, etc., when a sprinkler head flows water; and, on wet pipe systems, to provide directional flow (not cross connection control). 
C.  Detector Check. To detect unauthorized use of water for other than fire service; to detect leaks in fire protection systems; and to provide directional flow (not cross connections control). 
D.  Double Check. To prevent backflow to polluted water from fire protection systems into the potable water systems, and to provide directional flow. 
E.  Double Detector Check. To prevent backflow of polluted water from fire protection systems into the potable water system; to detect unauthorized use of water, to detect leaks in fire protection systems; and to provide directional flow. 
F.  Reduced Pressure Check. To prevent backflow of contaminated water from fire protection systems into the potable water system; to detect unauthorized use of water; to detect leaks in the fire protection system; and to provide directional flow. 
(Code 1978, § 5-5013; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96) 
6-20-140 - Combined systems. 
Directional checks, alarm checks, and detector checks that are used on standpipes, class 3 or higher sprinklers, or combined systems, may not be considered as a component part of a backflow preventer unless approved by the BLW manager. Specifically, the addition of a second check to one of these devices may not be substituted for a double check, or a double detector check, that is approved for cross connection control, unless such addition results in a device identical to that furnished by the manufacturer and the resulting assembly qualifies for the appropriate backflow preventer labels. 
(Code 1978, § 5-5014; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96) 
6-20-150 - Approved double check. 
It is intended that an approved double check be in lieu of, not in addition to, any signal check already required in the supply to class 3 sprinklers, to low hazard standpipes, or to combined systems; or, that an approved double detector check be substituted for any single detector check. In such cases, the net additional device(s) intended by this code are one line-size check and, in case of the detector, one bypass check. 
(Code 1978, § 5-5015; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96) 
6-20-160 - Valve installation. 
The two shut-off valves that are necessary for periodic testing of a backflow preventer need not be attached directly to the inlet and outlet flanges of the device, but shall be installed in a location close enough to the device and to insure that there are no intervening branch connection(s) between the shutoff valve and backflow preventer head. 
(Code 1978, § 5-5016; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96) 
6-20-170 - Valve approval. 
The two shut-off valves required for periodic testing and repair of a backflow preventer, whether supplied by the backflow preventer manufacturer or the fire protection contractor, shall be listed for fire protection service by a nationally recognized testing laboratory such as F.M. or U.L., and the inlet valve shall include an approved test cock on the upstream side. 
(Code 1978, § 5-5017; Ord. No. 5575, 6/12/96) 
6-20-180 - Identification of systems. 
To distinguish between systems used exclusively for fire service and those used for both fire service and potable water service, the following definitions shall apply: 
A.  Combined system. Consists of bulk and express risers that supply both standpipe and sprinkler systems. (This system is for fire service only.) 
B.  Combination system. A standpipe riser that supplies both fire service and potable water service. (This system is relatively new.)

It shall be the duty of every contractor who shall make contracts for the installation or repairs of buildings, structures, electrical, gas, mechanical, sprinkler or plumbing systems, for which a permit is required, to comply with state or local rules and regulations concerning licensing which the applicable governing authority may have adopted. In such case that the state requires a contractor to have obtained a state license before they are permitted to perform work, the contractor shall supply the local government with their license number before receiving a permit for work to be performed. 
F.  Conditions of the Permit. 
1.  Permit Intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of the construction codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of the construction codes. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six months after the time the worked is commenced. One or more extensions of time, for periods not more than 90 days each, may be allowed for the permit. The extension shall be requested in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated. Extensions shall be in writing by the building official. 
2.  Permit Issued on Basis of an Affidavit. Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the building official, are hazardous or complex, the building official shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations shall supervise such work. In addition, they shall be responsible for conformity with the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and upon completion make and file with the building official written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity with the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the construction codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his stead a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed by the building official. 
3.  Plans. When the building official issues a permit, he/she shall enforce, in writing or by stamp, both sets of plans "reviewed for code compliance." One set of drawings so reviewed shall be retained by the building official and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. The permitted drawings shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the building official or his/her authorized representative. 
G.  Fees. 
1.  Prescribed Fees. A permit shall not be issued until the fees prescribed by the governing body have been paid.

2.  Work Commencing Before Permit Issuance. Any person who commences any work on a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing, etc. system before obtaining the necessary permits, shall be subject to a penalty of 100 percent of the usual permit fee in addition to the required permit fees. 
3.  Accounting. The building official shall keep a permanent and accurate accounting of all permit fees and other money collected, the names of all persons upon whose account the same was paid, along with the date and amount thereof. 
4.  Schedule of Permit Fees. On all buildings, structures, electrical, plumbing, mechanical and gas systems or alterations requiring a permit, a fee for each permit shall be paid as required at the time of filing application, in accordance with the fee schedules as set by the governing body. 
5.  Building Permit Valuations. If, in the opinion of the building official, the valuation of building, alteration, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems appears to be underestimated on the application, permit shall be denied, unless the applicant can show detailed estimates to meet the approval of the building official. Permit valuations shall include total cost, such as electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing equipment and other systems, including materials and labor. For determining building replacement costs and minimum new construction costs see Code Section 7-4-2-050 G.6. 
6.  Building Construction Costs. For the purposes of evaluating construction cost estimates used to establish building replacement costs or minimum new construction costs the latest International Code Council Valuation Tables shall be used. Appeals regarding this article Section 7-4-2-050 G.6. shall be made in writing to the director of public works or designee thereof. Upon review of an appeal to this article the director of public works or designee thereof may allow alternate acceptable means to establish minimum construction costs apply.

Said duty to maintain property in a clean and sanitary condition shall include the duty to cut and remove undergrowth, such as kudzu, briars, grass, weeds and obnoxious vegetation in excess of 12 inches in height, leaves, debris, honeysuckle, other vines and seedlings, whenever such undergrowth becomes a nuisance to persons residing in the area or operating businesses in the area. This section shall not apply to governmentally mandated or approved buffers, wetlands, natural areas or undisturbed property, common areas or similar areas contained in a plat approved by the City of Marietta. If such should exist upon any property, the planning and zoning director may reduce the extent to which how much of the property must be maintained in such condition, provided there are no imminent threats to the health or safety of the public. 
B.  In the event it is determined that any property does not comply with Subsection A., above, it shall be the duty of the planning and zoning director or designee thereof to send a preliminary written notice to the property owner advising the property owner that such owner has seven days from the date of the mailing of such written notice to bring the property into compliance. Such written notice shall reference this Code section and shall further describe the conditions which are deemed to violate this Code section. 
C.  In the event the owner does not correct the condition or conditions contained in the written notice set forth in Subsection B., above, it shall be the duty of the planning and zoning director or a designee thereof to give five days' written notice, by certified mail, return receipt requested, and take reasonable steps to deliver in person to any owner of property or other person violating this section to appear before the municipal court to show cause why these provisions have not been complied with. Such written notice shall reference this Code section and shall further describe the conditions which are deemed to violate this Code section. In addition, the planning and zoning director or a designee shall immediately post a notification upon the property in violation of this section in order to provide visual notification to property owners for a period of five consecutive days. In lieu of inability to contact owners in other manners prescribed above, posted notice shall serve as the official notice for the municipal court hearing on this matter.

For purposes of giving the notice to the owner of the property, as provided for herein, the person shown as the owner of said property on the ad valorem tax records of the city shall be sent such notice at the address shown thereon, unless the city receives actual notice that another person owns said property that owner shall be responsible for said violation. 
D.  When the public works director has caused overgrown grass, weeds, and obnoxious vegetation to be cut from any premises, or wastepaper, trash, leaves, debris or other rubbish removed, a notice shall be prepared assessing the cost of the cutting of those overgrown grass and weeds, cleaning and rendering sanitary such vacant lot or other property against the owner, tenant, agent, or employee owning, occupying or controlling the property. The cost of such action shall be a debtor lien upon the property so cleaned and rendered sanitary and a debt against the owner, tenant, agent or other party in charge of the property. The debtor lien shall date from the completion of the work on the property as declared under city council ordinance. 
E.  A written statement shall be furnished by the city clerk to the owner, agent, or other party in charge of the property subject to the assessment provided for herein showing the amount of the assessment. It shall be the duty of the owner, agent, or other party in charge of the property subject to the assessment to pay the city within 30 days after the receipt of the statement the entire amount of the assessment against the property and the owner, tenant, agent, or other party in charge of the property. 
F.  Any owner, tenant, agent, or other party in control of property subject to assessment as provided herein who fails or refuses to pay to the city the amount of such assessment at the expiration of 30 days after the service of the notice of statement provided above, the city clerk shall issue an execution bearing date of its issuance in the name of the mayor of the city and specifying the purpose for which it is issued against the owner, tenant, agent, or other party in control of the property subject to the assessment and also against the property of the owner, tenant, agent, or other party in control of the property upon which the work in question is performed. The execution shall assert and be a lien against the property from the day of the completion of the performance of the work hereinbefore described and shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month from the date on which it is issued. For the purposes of this section, any period of less than one month shall be considered to be one month. 
G.  The execution issued under these provisions shall be delivered to the chief of police or a designee thereof who shall execute the same by levying upon and selling the property described therein or so much thereof as may be necessary for the amount due the city from the doing of such work, together with all costs that may accrue thereon.

i.  Minor repairs that do not alter the historic or architectural features existing on the building. Examples of items falling within this category, which do not require a certificate of appropriateness, are the following: 
a.  The painting of existing surfaces where the surface was previously painted; 
b.  A change in color to a previously painted surface; 
c.  New roofs or caps on roofs which are not visible from public rights-of-way and which do not change the character of the roof; 
d.  Roof repair or replacement where the color is the same as the roof it replaced or gray or black or white; 
e.  The replacement of HVAC where such replacement is in the same location and of the same scale (or slightly larger to accommodate higher energy efficient equipment) as that of the original equipment. Excluded from the exception in this paragraph are window units; 
f.  The replacement of gutters where the replacement is in the same location and of the same scale as that of the original equipment; 
g.  The replacement of awnings where the replacement is in the same location and of the same scale as that of the original equipment; 
h.  Housekeeping repairs, replacement of components due to normal wear, and maintenance on the exterior appearance of existing buildings subject to view from a public street or walk; 
i.  The replacement of historic windows (nonhistoric windows would be exempt) with like kind; 
j.  New gutters where none existed before. 
ii.  In the event an applicant is not certain about whether an item requires a certificate of appropriateness or not, an application shall be submitted to staff for review. In the event staff determines that they have the authority to approve the application because the change to the building is a minor repair, as defined in this section, then staff is given the authority to do so. In the event staff is not certain about whether the application would be considered a minor repair or a structural change then staff shall submit the application to the commission for consideration. 
E.  Effective Period. Except for a final certificate of appropriateness issued pursuant to Section 7-8-9-050 B.1., once a certificate of appropriateness has been approved, the action permitted under the certificate shall be commenced within three years. However, if a project under consideration for a certificate of appropriateness is submitted in phases and may be commenced accordingly, each phase shall be good for successive period of three years (i.e., three years for the first phase, three years for the second phase, etc.). The certificate of appropriateness may be renewed prior to expiration of the terms set forth herein by application to the commission for renewal. Said renewals shall be granted unless there are significant changes in the district that would be adverse to the granting of the renewal. Notwithstanding any other provision under this Code Section, all actions permitted shall be governed by the applicable construction codes and ancillary ordinances governing construction as of the date of the issuance of the permit. 
F.  Variances. Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this article would result in practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of any specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to the provisions or to interpret the meeting of the provision so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided however, that such variance, modification, or interpretation shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the provisions so that the architectural or historic integrity or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variations, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the purpose of this article. Variances for undue hardship shall only be granted where the undue hardship arises from circumstances not caused, controlled, or contributed to by the owner or occupant. Variances may also be issued for projects deemed to have "special merit" as described in Section 7-8-9-50 A. 
G.  Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness has 30 days to appeal such determination to the city council. The council or other governing body may approve, modify and approve, or reject the determination made by the commission if the council or other governing body found that the commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision. Further appeal may be taken in the manner provided by Georgia law. 
H.  Enforcement and Penalty for Violation. 
1.  Once a certificate of appropriateness has been issued, the work must conform to the certificate as issued. Failure to comply shall be grounds for the building inspector or the Commission to issue a cease and desist order. 
2.  The city council, commission, or building inspector shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any material change in the appearance of a designated historic property or district, except those changes made in compliance with the provisions of an ordinance adopted in conformity with this article, or to prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such historic property or historic district. Violations of any ordinance adopted in conformity with this article shall be punished in the same manner as provided by charter or local law for the punishment of violations under Zoning Ordinance Section 718.08. 
I.  Effect on Building and Demolition Permits. Any activity that does not require a building permit will not be required to obtain a certificate of appropriateness. Also, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit or demolition permit, the rejection of an application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or other administrative officials charged with issuing such permits; and, in such case, no permit shall be issued.

B.  Approval of Applications and Issuance of Certificates. Except for a final certificate of appropriateness issued pursuant to Section 7-8-9-050 B.1., the commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness, or recommend approval pursuant to Section 7-8-9-050 B.1., if it finds that the proposed material change in appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historical, architectural or cultural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance; architectural style; general design; arrangement, texture, and material of the architectural features involved; and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style and pertinent features of other structures in the immediate neighborhood. 
1.  Guidelines. 
a.  Where the definitions provided herein are not sufficient to make a determination on any application, the commission shall follow the approved design/preservation guidelines established. 
b.  The commission may also seek expert or technical advice but shall not bind itself or the city or the council for payment without prior approval from the council. 
c.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed as to prevent a new building being constructed in any historic district. 
2.  Prohibited Actions. The commission shall not consider interior arrangement or uses having no effect on exterior architectural features in its review of applications nor is the interior of a building subject to this chapter. The commission has no authority to review such interior arrangements in its review of applications for certificate of appropriateness. 
3.  Exempt Material Changes. Nothing in this article shall require a certificate of appropriateness or be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in or on a historic property, which maintenance or repair does not involve a material change in design, material, or outer appearance thereof, nor to prevent any property owner or occupant from making any use of his property not prohibited by other laws, ordinances, or regulations. Refer to Section 7-8-9-050 C. for a listing of specific exemptions. 
C.  Rejection of Applications. Except for a final certificate of appropriateness issued pursuant to Section 7-8-9-050 B.1., in the event the commission denies an application, or recommends denial pursuant to Section 7-8-9-050 B.1., it shall state its reasons for doing so at the meeting and shall transmit a record of such action and the reasons therefore, in writing, to the applicant within seven days of the meeting. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if so desired, may make modifications to the plan and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
D.  Time for Consideration. Except for a final certificate of appropriateness issued pursuant to Section 7-8-9-050 B.1., the commission shall approve or reject, or recommend approval or rejection pursuant to Section 7-8-9-050 B.1., an application for a certificate of appropriateness within 45 days after the filing thereof by the owner or occupant of a historic property or of a structure, site, or work of art located in a historic district. Following the review period, the commission shall present its recommendation at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the city council, pursuant to Section 7-8-9-050 B.1. Except for a certificate of appropriateness issued pursuant to Section 7-8-9-050 B.1., evidence of approval shall be by recommendation of a certificate of appropriateness by the commission. Failure of the commission to act within the 45-day period shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. The city shall provide confirmation of automatic approval to the applicant except for the certificate of appropriateness for demolitions as herein provided in Section 7-8-9-050 B.1.

2.  For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the available future-conditions flood elevations shall be provided by the public works director or designee. If future-conditions elevation data is not available from the public works director or designee, then it shall be determined by a licensed professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the public works director or designee. 
B.  Definition of Floodway Boundaries. 
1.  The width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA-approved flood study. For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the regulatory floodway shall be provided by the public works director or designee. If floodway data is not available from the public works director or designee, then it shall be determined by a licensed professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the public works director or designee. 
2.  Following a pre-design conference with the public works director or designee, the boundaries or limits of the floodway shall be shown on the (development or stormwater) site plan containing existing topographic information. 
C.  General Standards. 
1.  No development shall be allowed within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard that could result in any of the following: 
a.  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
b.  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity; 
c.  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or 
d.  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
2.  Any development within any area of special flood hazard or area of the future-conditions flood hazard allowed above shall also meet the following conditions: 
a.  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future-conditions flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
b.  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
c.  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
d.  Verification of no-rise conditions (0.01 foot or less), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of Section 7-8-10-040 D.; 
e.  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from flood waters; and 
f.  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the public works director or designee using the community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys and plans for a final letter of map revision (LOMR). 
D.  Engineering Study Requirements for Floodplain Encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and floodways. This study shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the public works director or designee prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
1.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
2.  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the public works director or designee. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood and future-conditions flood profiles; 
3.  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; and 
4.  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments. 
E.  Floodway Encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in Subsection 2. below. 
2.  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment will not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
3.  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the public works director or designee until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA or a no-rise certification is approved by the public works director or designee. 
F.  Maintenance Requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on the property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The public works director or designee may direct the property owner (at no cost to the city) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the public works director or designee. 
The property owner's failure to maintain facilities will be considered a violation of this article.

E.  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
F.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
G.  In reviewing such requests, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
H.  Conditions for Variances. 
1.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, or cause fraud on or victimization of the public. 
2.  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
3.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice by the city council specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base flood elevation will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property, and that such costs may be as high as $25.00 for each $100.00 of insurance coverage provided; and 
4.  The public works director or designee shall maintain the records of all variance actions, both granted and denied, and report them to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
I.  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the public works director or designee and city council shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request.

7-8-12-040 - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
A.  General Provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of Sections 7-8-12-040 B. and C. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
B.  Minimum Requirements/BMPs. 
1.  Best management practices as set forth in Sections 7-8-12-040 B. and C. shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph 2. of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
2.  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
3.  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
4.  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
5.  The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in Subsections C.15., 16. and 17., in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c) (City of Marietta Stream Buffer Protection Ordinance, Article 7-10). 
C.  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit, and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
1.  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
2.  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
3.  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
4.  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
5.  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
6.  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
7.  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
8.  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
9.  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
10.  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
11.  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
12.  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
13.  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
14.  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in Section 7-8-12-040 B.2.; 
15.  Except as provided in paragraphs 16. and 17. of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except: 
(1)  Where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8; or 
(2)  Where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; 
(3)  Where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or 
(4)  Along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer (City of Marietta Stream Buffer Protection Ordinance, Article 7-10): 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; 
16.  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; 
17.  There is established a 25 foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the coastal marshland buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade stormwater detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph, "maintenance" shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a coastal marshland buffer and a coastal marshland buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a coastal marshland buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a coastal marshland buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; 
b.  The coastal marshland buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the coastal marshland buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented; 
c.  The coastal marshland buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this article and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot coastal marshland buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented; and 
d.  Activities where the area within the coastal marshland buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of coastal marshland buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved coastal marshland buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land-disturbing activities. 
D.  Nothing contained in this article shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in Sections 7-8-12-040 B. and C. 
E.  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 8051, 10/10/2018, § 1) 
7-8-12-050 - Application/permit process. 
A.  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review before submittal the general development plans and detailed plans of the local issuing authority that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, stream buffer protection ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
B.  Application Requirements. 
1.  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the public works department to perform such activity and providing a copy of an NOI submitted to EPD, if applicable. 
2.  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the public works department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in Section 7-8-12-050 C. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of Sections 7-8-12-040 B. and C. will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by a copy of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
3.  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
4.  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by Sections 7-8-12-040 C.15., 16. and 17. have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per Section 7-8-12-050 B.6., have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
5.  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
6.  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
C.  Plan Requirements. 
1.  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in Sections 7-8-12-040 B. and C., or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
2.  Data required for the plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
D.  Permits. 
1.  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable, but in any event, not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
2.  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by Sections 7-8-12-040 C.15., 16. and 17. are obtained; bonding requirements, if necessary, as per Section 7-8-12-050 B.6. are met; and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
3.  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
4.  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
5.  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sedimentation and pollution plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
6.  The local issuing authority may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1).

The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article: 
A.  Water Quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
1.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
2.  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and 
3.  Runoff from land uses and activities identified by the public works director are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
B.  Stream Channel Protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
1.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation of the applicable stream buffer as approved by the city; 
2.  Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the public works director for sites that discharge directly into larger streams, rivers, wetlands, or lakes, or to a manmade channel or conveyance system where the reduction in these flows will not have an impact on upstream or downstream streambank or channel integrity. 
3.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
C.  Overbank Flooding Protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the predevelopment rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under Subsection B. is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
D.  Extreme Flooding Protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
E.  Structural Stormwater Controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from public works director or designee before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the public works director or designee may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
F.  Stormwater Credits for Nonstructural Measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under Subsection A. The applicant may, if approved by the public works director or designee, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
G.  Drainage System Guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include, but are not limited to, culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutters, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public rights-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more than one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements:

3.  No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback. 
B.  Variance Procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
1.  Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of this chapter, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this chapter, and the Public Works Director, or his designee, finds and determines that the requirements of this chapter prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the City Council of the City of Marietta may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
2.  Where a proposed encroachment into the buffer or impervious area setback can be mitigated by increasing the buffer and/or setback size on another portion of the same property, in an amount equal to the size of the proposed encroachment, and if the expanded area of buffer and/or setback is contiguous to the existing stream buffer, the Public Works Director, or his designee, may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements of this chapter. 
3.  Except as provided above, the City Council of the City of Marietta shall grant no variance from any provision of this chapter without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the City Council of the City of Marietta. The City of Marietta shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within City of Marietta. The City of Marietta shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. 
4.  Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
a.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted; 
b.  Georgia Environmental Protection Division has issued a variance to the state waters buffer on a segment of the stream on the property; 
c.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in this chapter would create an extreme hardship. 
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of this chapter, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
5.  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
a.  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
b.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
c.  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
e.  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and 
h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
6.  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; and 
d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
e.  The longterm and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; 
f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment. 
(Ord. No. 6971, 10/11/2006, § 5) 
7-10-060 - Compatibility with other buffer regulations and requirements. 
This chapter is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. The requirements of this chapter should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.

(Ord. No. 6971, 10/11/2006, § 7) 
7-10-080 - Responsibility. 
Neither the issuance of a development permit nor compliance with the conditions thereof, nor with the provisions of this chapter shall relieve any person from any responsibility otherwise imposed by law for damage to persons or property; nor shall the issuance of any permit hereunder serve to impose any liability upon City of Marietta, its officers or employees, for injury or damage to persons or property. 
(Ord. No. 6971, 10/11/2006, § 8) 
7-10-090 - Inspection. 
The Public Works Department may cause inspections of the work in the buffer or setback to be made periodically during the course thereof and shall make a final inspection following completion of the work.

Residential buildings must be designed and constructed so as to meet the definition of four-sided architecture, as defined in Section 724.02. All commercial building facades visible from a public street must also be designed and constructed so as to meet the definition of four-sided architecture, as defined in Section 724.02. In this district smaller lots than might otherwise be permitted under traditional zoning districts may be allowed; however, the purpose is not merely to allow smaller lots or reduce development requirements but to achieve other goals including the protection of sensitive environmental, historic, or aesthetic resources as well as the provision of site amenities such as parks, open space, walking trails, etc. The MXD district is not intended to encourage greater density of development, but rather to facilitate compatible commercial and noncommercial uses and provide quality developments which enhance the surrounding area. This district may also be utilized to foster the adaptive reuse of existing buildings. 
B.  Permitted Uses. This district is designed to allow mixed-use developments which are designed under a unified plan. The planned development should incorporate features such as coordinated transportation and parking networks, building design parameters and holistic landscaping themes.

3.  Townhouses and condominiums shall be "for sale" only, and no more than 5% of all the homes within the residential development shall be allowed to be renter occupied at any time. 
4.  The development shall be constructed and governed in conformity with the requirements of the Georgia Condominium Act (O.C.G.A. § 44-3-70 et seq.). A Declaration of Condominium shall be submitted and recorded in compliance of this Act. 
5.  All townhouses and townhouse style condominiums shall have 2-car garages, and the parking pads in front of the garage shall be a minimum of 20 feet in length in order to accommodate 2 additional cars. The garages shall be used for the parking and storage of vehicles and may not be enclosed to provide for additional residential space. A recital of this requirement shall be contained within the covenants to ensure enforcement. 
6.  Additional guest parking shall be required at a ratio of 0.2 spaces per dwelling unit. 
7.  The development shall comply with all recommendations from the City of Marietta Public Works Department with respect to hydrology, stormwater management, down stream considerations and any donation and/or conveyance of right-of-way that is deemed necessary.

708.28 - PID, Planned Industrial Development. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. The PID district is intended to allow flexible site planning and building arrangements for industrial development under a unified plan so that innovative land planning methods may be utilized which create campus-like environments, foster natural resource conservation and reduce traffic congestion. This may permit buildings to be clustered or arranged in an unconventional manner to maximize open space, create a pedestrian scale and other public benefits. All commercial and industrial building facades that are visible from a public street must be designed and constructed so as to meet the definition of four-sided architecture, as defined in Section 724.02. In this district smaller lots than might otherwise be permitted under traditional zoning districts may be allowed; however, the purpose is not merely to allow smaller lots or reduce development requirements but to achieve other goals including the protection of sensitive environmental, historic, or aesthetic resources as well as the provision of site amenities such as parks, open space, walking trails, etc. The PID district is not intended to encourage greater density of development, but rather to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning techniques which result in industrial development patterns that conserve and create open space, reduce vehicle trips and provide quality developments which enhance the surrounding area. 
B.  Permitted Uses. This district is designed to allow industrial parks which are developed under a unified plan. The planned development should incorporate features such as coordinated transportation and parking networks, building design parameters and holistic landscaping themes. 
C.  Temporary/Conditional Uses Allowed by the Director. Not applicable in this district. 
D.  Special Uses Permitted by Board of Zoning Appeals. Not applicable in this district. 
E.  Special Uses Permitted by City Council. Only those uses delineated in the approved general and detailed plans. 
F.  Accessory Structures. Only those structures delineated in the approved general and detailed plans. 
G.  Use Limitations. All outside storage areas must be located in the rear yard and must be screened by an opaque fence no less than 8 feet in height. 
H.  Bulk and Area Regulations. 
Minimum tract size: 5 acres. 
Maximum impervious surface: 65% of entire development. 
I.  Landscape and Buffer Requirements. When a property in this district directly abuts a residential district, a 50-foot greenbelt buffer shall be established. Such buffer must include a solid fence or wall no less than 6 feet in height. All loading docks shall be screened by either landscaping or a stabilized berm. Stormwater retention facilities are not permitted within required buffers. 
J.  Procedure for Establishment of Planned Development District. 
1.  General Plan Filed. The owner or owners of the entire tract of land proposed to be included in the planned development districts shall file a general plan with a request for a change in zoning with the Planning Commission for consideration and referral to the City Council for recommendation.

712.01 - Special land use permits. 
A.  Within each zoning district's standards, certain property uses may be allowed provided they obtain a Special Land Use Permit (SLUP) from either the Board of zoning appeals or City Council. This additional review is necessary due to the increased possibility that such uses may have a negative impact on surrounding properties and their value. The City retains its right to subject certain uses to greater scrutiny to determine if they are appropriate or if additional safeguards may mitigate potentially harmful effects on neighboring properties. Table B below denotes those uses which are permitted only after issuance of a Special Land Use Permit, permitted zoning districts and issuing entity. 
_____
TABLE B. SPECIAL LAND USE PERMITS 

 
B.  All applications for Special Land Use Permits heard by the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be advertised in the same manner as applications for variances and public hearings will be held thereon in the same manner. 
C.  All applications for Special Land Use Permits heard by City Council shall be advertised in the same manner as applications for rezoning and public hearings will be held thereon in the same manner. 
D.  The issuing board may grant Special Land Use Permits for any given period of time at their own discretion. 
E.  The issuing board shall consider, at a minimum, the following in its determination of whether or not to grant a Special Land Use Permit: 
1.  Whether or not there will be a significant adverse effect on the neighborhood or area in which the proposed use will be located. 
2.  Whether or not the use is compatible with the neighborhood. 
3.  Whether or not the proposed use will constitute a nuisance as defined by state law. 
4.  Whether or not property values of surrounding property will be adversely affected. 
5.  Whether or not adequate provisions are made for parking and traffic considerations. 
6.  Whether or not the site or intensity of the use is appropriate. 
7.  Whether or not adequate provisions are made regarding hours of operation. 
8.  The location or proximity of other similar uses (whether conforming or nonconforming). 
9.  Whether or not adequate controls and limits are placed upon commercial deliveries. 
10.  Whether or not adequate landscaping plans are incorporated to ensure appropriate transition. 
11.  Whether or not the public health, safety and welfare of the surrounding neighborhoods will be adversely affected. 
(Ord. No. 6728, 9/8/2004, § 4; Ord. No. 6851, 9/14/2005, § 2; Ord. No. 7032, 4/11/2007, § 1; Ord. No. 7232, 9/10/2008, § 5; Ord. No. 7671, 8/14/2013, § 7; Ord. No. 7881, 6/8/2016, § 7; Ord. No. 7961, 6/14/2017, § 12) 
Cross reference— Special land use permit necessary, § 704.06. 
712.02 - Community residences. 
A.  Intent and Purpose. The Fair Housing Amendment Act (1988) states that local zoning regulations may not prohibit community residences and requires that municipalities provide "reasonable accommodation" of such uses. The City of Marietta regulates community residences using criteria based upon the actual use of the facility and the number of individuals utilizing its services. This provides individuals with opportunities for normalization instead of institutionalization thereby reducing social costs and fostering personal growth and responsibility while also allowing the City to maintain viable neighborhoods based primarily upon similar single-family or planned multifamily dwellings. 
B.  Group Homes. Group homes are defined throughout the entirety of this ordinance as dwellings shared by individuals who live together as a single housekeeping unit and in a long-term family-like environment in which staff persons provide care, education and participation in community activities for the residents with the primary goal of enabling the residents to live as independently as possible in order to reach their maximum potential. This use shall also apply to homes for the handicapped; however, the term "handicapped" shall not include current illegal use of or addiction to a controlled substance or alcohol, nor shall it include any person whose residency in the home would constitute a direct threat to the health and safety of other individuals. The term "group home for the handicapped" shall not include alcohol or drug treatment centers, work release facilities for convicts or ex-convicts, or other housing serving as an alternative to incarceration. 
1.  Group homes with 3 or fewer residents, exclusive of resident staff, are permitted uses within the R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, and PRD-SF zoning districts, provided: 
a)  The structure meets all aspects of the Standard Housing Code, including minimum dwelling space requirements. 
b)  The operator of the group home obtains certification from the appropriate state licensing body. 
c)  No other such facility or halfway house is located within 1,000 feet as measured from property line to property line. 
2.  Group homes with more than 3 residents, exclusive of resident staff, may be permitted within the R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, and PRD-SF zoning districts only if granted a Special Land Use Permit (SLUP) after a public hearing before the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
3.  Group homes may be permitted within RA-4, RA-6, RA-8 and LRO zoning districts (regardless of the number of occupants) if granted a SLUP from the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
4.  Group homes are considered permitted uses by right in OI, RM and RHR zoning districts, subject to those standards set forth therein. 
C.  Halfway Houses. Halfway houses are temporary residential living arrangements for persons leaving an institutional setting and in need of a supportive living arrangement in order to readjust to living outside the institution. These are persons who are receiving therapy and counseling from support staff who are present when residents are present, for the following purposes: 
• to help them recuperate from the effects of drug or alcohol addiction; 
• to help them reenter society while housed under supervision or while under the constraints of alternatives to imprisonment including, but not limited to, prerelease, work release, or probationary programs; or 
• to help persons with family or school adjustment problems that require specialized attention and care in order to achieve personal independence. 
1.  Halfway houses may be permitted within OI, RM and RHR zoning districts only if granted a Special Land Use Permit (SLUP) from the Board of Zoning Appeals and are limited to 1 bed per 250 gross square feet of heated building space. 
a)  The structure meets all aspects of the Standard Housing Code including minimum dwelling space requirements. 
b)  The operator obtains certification from the appropriate state licensing body. 
c)  No other such facility is located within 1,000 feet as measured from property line to property line. 
(Ord. No. 7513, 1/12/2011, § 5; Ord. No. 7881, 6/8/2016, §§ 8, 9; Ord. No. 7961, 6/14/2017, § 13) 
712.03 - Extended stay facilities. 
A.  "Extended stay hotels or motels" shall be defined as any hotel or motel in which 50% or greater of all guest rooms have facilities for both the storage, refrigeration, and preparation of food, and/or which are advertised, designed, or utilized for weekly or monthly occupancy. 
B.  A special land use permit must be obtained for the construction and operation of extended stay hotels and motels and may only be permitted in OS, OHR, and RRC zoning districts; furthermore, extended stay hotels and motels shall comply with the following restrictions: 
1.  All guest rooms which have facilities for both the storage and preparation of food and have less than 300 square feet of floor area are limited to a maximum of 2 persons per such room; however, for all such guest rooms greater than 300 square feet, one additional person shall be allowable per each additional 75 square feet of floor area up to and including a maximum of 4 persons. 
2.  Minimum lot size for extended stay hotels is 2 acres. 
3.  No more than 10% of individual guests shall register, reside in, or occupy any room or rooms within the same licensed facility for more than a 90-day period. 
[3.1]  An indoor or fenced outdoor active recreation area shall be provided. The size of each recreation area shall be calculated at a ratio of 5 square feet per room with a minimum provision of 750 square feet. All recreation areas must be approved by the Planning and Zoning Director prior to development to ensure that all applicable safety specifications and standards are met. 
4.  No permanent business license shall be issued for the conduct of any business from any guest room of the facility. 
5.  No hotel or motel under this section is to be converted to or used as an apartment or condominium without prior approval of City Council. Any hotel or motel converted to such use must meet all applicable state and local codes including zoning standards. 
6.  No hotel or motel or other structure can be converted to an extended stay facility without meeting all of the rules and regulations contained within Section 712.03 and must obtain a special land use permit from City Council, as mentioned in Section 712.01. 
7.  Extended stay hotels/motels must have a landscape plan submitted, approved, and constructed prior to issuance of a business license. 
8.  Extended stay hotels/motels must have a minimum of 25% of the lot area dedicated to either active or passive open space. The open space shall include active recreation, such as a children's playground area, and/or passive recreation, such as greenspace and walking paths. 
9.  Each guest room must be protected with a sprinkler system approved by the fire marshal or their designee. 
10.  Each guest room having a stove-top unit or other type burner unit shall be required to also include a maximum 60 minute automatic power off timer for each such unit. 
11.  A hard-wired smoke detector shall be provided and installed in each guest room. 
12.  No outside storage or permanent parking of equipment or vehicles shall be allowed. 
13.  All such facilities shall provide a 50-foot undisturbed buffer from any property zoned for multifamily residential purposes and/or a 100-foot undisturbed buffer from any property zoned for single family residential purposes. 
14.  No building may be placed within 300 feet of any residentially zoned property, inclusive of the required buffer. 
15.  These restrictions shall apply to all facilities permitted or expanded after September 8, 2004. 
16.  All extended stay facilities shall have a maximum density of 75 guest units per gross acre of development. 
(Ord. No. 6728, 9/8/2004, § 5) 
712.04 - Home occupations. 
A.  Intent and Purpose. Certain occupational uses termed "home occupations" are allowed in dwelling units on the basis that such uses are incidental to the use of the premises as a residence. They have special regulations that apply to ensure that home occupations will not be a detriment to the character and livability of the surrounding neighborhood. The regulations ensure that the accessory home occupation remains subordinate to the residential use and the residential viability of the dwelling is maintained. The regulations recognize that many types of jobs can be done in a home with little or no effect on the surrounding neighborhood and, as such, may be permitted provided such uses: 
1.  Are incidental to the use of the premises as a residence; 
2.  Are conducted within the bona fide residence of the principal practitioner; 
3.  Are compatible with residential uses; 
4.  Are limited in extent and do not detract from the residential character of the neighborhood. 
B.  Definition of Accessory Home Occupations. There are 2 types of home occupations, Type A and Type B. Permit requirements and uses allowed in each type vary and are allowed only if they comply with all of the requirements of this ordinance. Deviation from any standard requires a variance approval from City Council. 
1.  In Type A home occupations resident(s) use their home as a place of work, home office or business mailing address. Employees or customers are prohibited from coming to the site. Examples include artists, crafts people, writers and consultants. 
2.  In Type B home occupations resident(s) use their home for work, home office or business mailing address which requires or results in either an employee or consultant or agent or subcontractor or customer coming to the site. Examples are counseling, tutoring, and certain office uses. Type B home occupations must obtain a special land use permit from City Council due to their greater possible impact on the surrounding neighborhood as a result of individuals and visitors from outside the neighborhood coming to the property. 
C.  General Provisions and Prohibited Uses. All home occupations shall meet the following: 
1.  A home occupation shall be incidental and accessory to the use of a dwelling as a residence. No more than 750 square feet, 25% of the floor space of the dwelling unit, whichever is less (including attached garages), may be used for the occupation. 
2.  There shall be no exterior evidence of the home occupation or alteration of the residence and/or accessory buildings to accommodate the home occupation. Internal or external changes which will make the dwelling appear less residential in nature or function are prohibited. Examples of such prohibited alterations include construction of parking lots, paving of required setbacks, or adding commercial-like exterior lighting. Any alteration or addition which expands the floor area of the principal structure dedicated to the home occupation use shall void the existing business license and require a new business license be obtained, subject to property compliance verification by the Department of Development Services. For Type B home occupations a new public hearing must be held for the rights associated with the special land use permit to be reestablished. 
3.  There shall be no outside operations or exterior storage of inventory or materials to be used in conjunction with a home occupation. 
4.  Off-site employees of the resident shall not congregate on the premises for any purpose concerning the home occupation nor park their personal vehicles at the location. 
5.  No article, product or service used or sold in connection with such activity shall be other than those normally found on the premises. 
6.  No more than 1 vehicle associated with the home occupation may be parked at the site. Such vehicle is limited to 1½-ton carrying capacity and must be used exclusively by the resident and parked on a valid improved surface. 
7.  No use or activity may create noise, dust, glare, vibration, smoke, smell, electrical interference or any fire hazard. 
8.  All home occupations shall be subject to periodic inspections by the Department of Development Services. 
9.  Any type of repair or assembly of vehicles or equipment with internal combustion engines (such as autos, motorcycles, marine engines, lawn mowers, chain saws and other small engines) or of large appliances (such as washing machines, dryers, and refrigerators) or any other work related to automobiles and their parts is prohibited. 
10.  Group instruction, assembly or activity shall be prohibited. 
11.  Accessory home occupations may not serve as headquarters or dispatch centers where employees come to the site and are dispatched to other locations. 
12.  The Department of Development Services must approve all business licenses which shall be recertified annually. 
D.  Specific Criteria for Type A Home Occupations. In addition to the general criteria established in Subsection C., Type A home occupations are subject to the following restrictions: 
1.  No clients, nonresident employees or customers are allowed on the premises. 
2.  Pickups from and deliveries to the site in regard to the business shall be restricted to vehicles which have no more than 2 axles and shall be restricted to no more than 2 pickups or deliveries per day between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. 
3.  No signage regarding the home occupation is permitted on the property. 
4.  No advertisement shall be placed in any media (including flyers soliciting business) containing the address of the property. 
E.  Specific Criteria for Type B Home Occupations. In addition to the general criteria established in Subsection C., Type B home occupations are subject to the following restrictions: 
1.  A Special Land Use Permit must be obtained from City Council following a public hearing, which shall follow the same procedures and fees set forth in Division 720. City Council shall consider the desires of the immediate neighborhood, the nature of the proposed business, the availability of parking, traffic generation and any other issue that may detract from the residential character of the area and property values. 
2.  No Type B home occupation may be established in districts zoned for multifamily residential purposes. 
3.  No more than one Type B home occupation per dwelling is permitted. 
4.  Uses that may be permitted as Type B home occupations include those in which only the occupants of the dwelling and 1 additional employee or consultant or agent or subcontractor shall be authorized to work on the premises. Visitation by clients in conjunction with a home occupation shall be limited to 2 per week; provided however, that the following exception is made for purposes of meeting overriding public goals of education: 
Tutoring or the instruction of music, dance, arts and crafts and similar subjects, limited to 2 students in home at 1 time. 
5.  The following uses are specifically prohibited as Type B home occupations (list not all-inclusive): auto sales or auto repair; restaurants or any preparation of food or drink; animal hospitals; veterinary clinics; kennels or the keeping of animals; funeral homes; retail or wholesale shops; personal service establishments; special events facilities; lodging services; or day care. 
6.  Customers may visit the site only between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. 
7.  The applicant for any proposed Type B home occupation must provide city staff with a copy of the most recent recorded protective covenants applicable to the subject property. The applicant must submit a copy of the request to the homeowner's association, if any, and must provide a copy of the response, if any, to the city staff. The burden of proof shall be upon the applicant to show that the proposed use is allowed by the protective covenants; and 
8.  If the proposed use clearly violates the subdivision covenants, staff shall have the authority to deny the application. The applicant may appeal the denial to City Council at the next regularly scheduled meeting, but such an appeal shall not require a public hearing. If Staff's decision is affirmed by City Council, the matter shall be concluded. If City Council reverses staff's decision, the matter would be placed on a subsequent City Council agenda for a full public hearing.

712.05 - AICUZ, Air Installation Compatible Use Zone Overlay District. 
A.  Intent and Purpose. The Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Overlay District is established to contribute to the safe operation of Dobbins Air Reserve Base (ARB), to facilitate orderly development around the airfield, to protect property values, and to control and minimize noise and potential accident impacts on the surrounding areas of the City of Marietta. The AICUZ Overlay District promotes development patterns which are appropriate for the airfield vicinity and protect the public's safety and welfare by limiting land uses near the airport which require or generate large concentrations of individuals. The boundaries, recommendations and regulations contained herein are taken directly from studies conducted at Dobbins ARB by the United States Air Force, and specifically the Air Installation Compatible Use Zone Study for Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Georgia, dated October 2011 (hereby referenced and on file in the City Clerk's office). 
For all proposed development(s) and/or redevelopment(s) within any zone of the AICUZ Overlay District, the Director of the Department of Development Services, or his designee, shall be responsible for determining whether a particular use is compatible within a specific zone. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have jurisdiction to hear any appeal of a decision or determination made by the Director, or his designee. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  Properties subject to the AICUZ Overlay District shall be referenced on maps maintained by the Marietta Department of Development Services. 
2.  The AICUZ Overlay District regulates and recommends uses for the affected properties within the accident potential and noise zones, which were determined by the 2011 Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Study for Dobbins ARB and shall be considered complementary of any other zoning district standards. 
3.  Properties located within the AICUZ Overlay District, which were developed prior to the adoption of this ordinance, are considered "grandfathered" and fully protected from new or revised AICUZ regulations that were not in effect prior to that date. This "grandfathered" status conveys upon such properties the right to construct or reconstruct a building on the same building footprint, or to make structural alterations to the existing building, as long as neither the area nor the height of the building is increased. All other City Codes, including, but not limited to, building, fire, zoning and other development standards would be required to be met. 
4.  Properties located within the AICUZ Overlay District that are proposed for development after the adoption of this ordinance are subject to the rules set by this section. For the purpose of this section, "development" shall be defined as follows: 
a)  The construction, reconstruction, structural alteration, relocation, or enlargement of any buildings; 
b)  Any clearing, grading, or other movement of land for which permission is required. 
5.  The Department of Development Services shall notify any person submitting an application for a building permit, rezoning, special land use permit or variance, or any other permit issued by the City of Marietta, if the property in question is within the AICUZ Overlay District. 
6.  However, no development shall be permitted in any portion of the AICUZ Overlay District that may: 
a)  Involve fire or explosive, toxic, corrosive or other hazardous materials. 
b)  Release any air-borne substances such as steam, dust, and smoke, which would impair visibility or otherwise interfere with the operation of aircraft. 
c)  Produce light emissions, which would either directly or indirectly (reflective) interfere with pilot vision. 
d)  Produce electrical emissions which would interfere with aircraft communications systems or navigational equipment. 
e)  Be designed so as to attract birds or waterfowl. 
C.  Accident Potential and Noise Zones Three primary determinants are used in promoting compatibility between the airfield and nearby areas: accident potential to land users, hazards to operations from land uses (height, obstructions, etc.), and aircraft noise. The AICUZ Overlay District establishes use restrictions, recommended noise reduction measures, and height limitations as necessary to produce compatible land uses in each of these areas. 
1.  Clear Zones (CZ): This is an area starting at the end of the runway and extending outward 3,000 feet by 3,000 feet (the runway centerline is the midpoint for the width), presenting the greatest accident risk of all the designated accident potential zones; thereby, extra protection is required. CZ includes all lands encompassed within the area designated CZ on the Official Zoning Map of the City of Marietta. The placing of structures, buildings, or electric transmission lines located above ground in the clear zones is subject to FAA review and approval. 
2.  Accident Potential I Zones (APZ I): This is an area extending outward from the CZ an additional 5,000 feet by 3,000 feet (the runway centerline is the midpoint for the width) presenting a risk of aircraft accident less than the CZ but greater than APZ II; thereby, extra protection is required. APZ I includes all land encompassed within the area designated APZ I on the Official Zoning Map of the City of Marietta. 
3.  Accident Potential II Zones (APZ II): This is an area extending outward from APZ I an additional 7,000 feet by 3,000 feet (the runway centerline is the midpoint for the width) presenting a risk of accident less than both the CZ and APZ I, but a measurable risk nonetheless; thereby, extra protection is required. APZ II includes all lands encompassed within the area designated APZ II on the Official Zoning Map of the City of Marietta. 
4.  Noise Zones: The noise environment of the AICUZ Overlay District is depicted as contours with day-night sound levels (DNL) in excess of 65 decibels. Land use guidelines are based on the compatibility of various land uses with the listed noise exposure ranges. (All AICUZ Overlay District noise guidelines are on file in the City Clerk's office, in the "Guidelines for Construction in Marietta's AICUZ Overlay District.") 
D.  Permitted Uses The AICUZ Overlay District establishes use restrictions, recommended noise reduction measures, and height limitations, as necessary, to produce compatible land uses in each of the 3 accident potential and noise zones identified above (see recommended land uses in Section 3.4, Land Use Compatibility Guideline and Table 3-1 of the 2011 Air Institution Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Study). No new or proposed development (as defined in Subsection 712.05B.4.) shall be approved unless in accordance with the requirements of this section and those of the underlying zoning classification, except as otherwise approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals (see Subsection 712.05F.). 
E.  Height Restrictions. Height restrictions are necessary to ensure that buildings and structures in the vicinity of Dobbins will not impair flight safety. A series of imaginary surfaces surrounding the airfield is defined by the Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 77, "Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace." Any object or structure which would penetrate any of these imaginary surfaces is considered by the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) to be an obstruction to air navigation. Appendix D of the Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Study for Dobbins ARB (October 2011) provides detailed criteria for determining whether an object or structure constitutes an obstruction. 
F.  Permits. Any building permit submitted for properties within the AICUZ Overlay District shall be reviewed by the Department of Development Services to determine whether it meets the standards set forth in this section. Those applications which do not meet these criteria shall be required to seek a variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals (see paragraph G). 
1.  No permit shall be granted by the city that would allow the establishment of a flight hazard not authorized by this section or permit a non-conforming structure, or natural growth to become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation or become less compatible than it was on the effective date of this section. 
2.  Before any existing structure within any portion of the AICUZ Overlay District may be altered in such a manner as to increase its base height, a letter from Dobbins Air Reserve Base is required. The letter should state that Dobbins ARB does not object to the violation of the height limit. 
3.  No new or proposed development, as defined in Subsection 712.05B.4., shall be approved unless in accordance with the requirements of this section and those of the underlying zoning classification. Conflicts between uses permitted in the underlying zoning classification, but not recommended by the Land Use Compatibility Guidelines (Section 3.4, Land Use Compatibility Guideline and Table 3-1 of the 2011 Air Institution Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Study), may be reconciled by a decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
G.  Variances. Any person desiring to erect any structure, increase the height of any structure, permit natural growth, or use property not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this section may apply for a variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals. Said application must include an official response from the Commander of Dobbins ARB, or his designee, which sets forth the facility's recommendation as to the variance request.

2.  Buffer. A natural undisturbed portion of a lot which is set aside to achieve a visual and noise barrier between land uses. A buffer is achieved with natural vegetation, except for approved access and utility crossings, and must be replanted when sparsely vegetated subject to the approval of the Department of Development Services. See Section 710.05 for regulations addressing buffers. 
3.  Caliper. American Association of Nurseryman standard for trunk measurement of nursery stock. Caliper of the trunk shall be taken 6 inches above the ground for up to and including 4-inch-caliper size, and 12 inches above the ground for larger sizes. 
4.  Canopy Drip Line. The vertical line extending from the outer surface of a tree's branch tips down to the ground containing the tree's critical root zone (see Figure A). 
5.  DBH. Diameter-at-breast-height is a standard measure of tree size and is a tree trunk diameter measured 4½ feet above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below 4½ feet, then the trunk is measured at the point directly beneath the split. 
6.  Density Unit. A unit of measurement used to prescribe and calculate required tree coverage on a site. Unit measurements are based upon tree size and are not equal to individual tree counts. 
7.  DFD. Density factor deficit is the unit value that cannot be provided for on site, or the difference between the SDF and the summation of the RDF and EDF. 
8.  EDF. Existing density factor (EDF) is the density of existing trees to be preserved on a site. The EDF is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees to density units. 
9.  Evergreen Tree. A tree than has leaves in all seasons. 
10.  Hardwood Tree. Trees with broad, flat leaves as opposed to coniferous or needled trees. Wood hardness varies among hardwood species and some are actually softer than some softwoods.

17.  Revegetation. The replacement of trees or landscape plant materials into the minimum required landscape areas. 
18.  SDF. Site density factor (SDF) is the minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed site. 
19.  Specimen Tree. Any tree which has been determined to be of a high value because of its species, size, age, or other arboreal criteria (see Subsection D.4.d). 
20.  Tree. Any self-supporting woody plant, usually having a single woody trunk and a potential DBH of at least 2 inches. 
D.  Tree Preservation and Replacement. A tree protection and landscaping plan shall be submitted with all other permit drawings as part of the building permit process on any non-exempt parcel of land. Land disturbing activity includes any activity which may result in soil erosion from water or wind and the movement of sediments into state waters or onto lands within the state, including, but not limited to, clearing, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting, and filling of land, excluding agricultural practices. The intent of these standards is to provide the necessary information to facilitate development project design, plan review, and enforcement processes in order that the provisions of the ordinance are administered in the most effective manner. 
1.  No land disturbance permit shall be issued for projects/lots until the landscaping plans have been reviewed and approved by the Department of Development Services. All tree protection measures shall be installed prior to land disturbance and no land disturbance permit shall be issued for full site development without it being determined that the proposed development is in compliance with the provisions of these regulations. The tree protection and landscape plan may either be a separate drawing or part of the overall landscape plan, but shall include the following information: 
a)  The name of the project. 
b)  The name of the owner and/or developer, including 24-hour contact. 
c)  The location of proposed building(s) and corresponding dimensions. 
d)  Spatial limits of land disturbance, clearing, grading and trenching. 
e)  All required undisturbed buffers, landscape strips and parking islands. 
f)  The location of all specimen trees or stands of specimen trees with an indication whether they are to be retained or removed; accurate locations are required when the preservation of a specimen tree is questionable, or when a site design alteration is feasible. 
g)  The location of all hardwood and softwood trees with a DBH > 3 inches to be counted toward counting density requirements. Sampling methods may be used to determine existing tree densities for large forested areas subject to prior approval of the City Arborist. 
h)  Areas of tree protection and revegetation and all relevant tree density calculations. 
i)  The specific name and location of all materials to be planted or maintained on the site. 
j)  Procedures and schedules for the implementation, installation and maintenance of tree protection measures, including, but not limited to, detailed drawings of protective tree fencing (both active and passive) including signage and erosion control measures. Tree protection fencing must be shown around the canopy drip line of any tree or stands of trees proposed to be saved for tree density credit on the site. Tree protection fencing must be indicated on the erosion control plans and grading plans, as well as the tree protection and landscape plans so as to ensure that tree protection areas are not disturbed. 
k)  Planting and staking specifications. 
l)  The location of any utilities, easements, or signs. 
2.  Grading for future site development shall be considered and regulated as timbering and mining unless site development plans are submitted and approved as per city platting regulations. Applications for tree cutting, clearing or clearing and grubbing shall be in accordance with current land disturbance permit plan review procedures and shall meet the following standards: 
a)  The exterior boundary of the site shall have an undisturbed 50-foot buffer area. This buffer area shall remain undisturbed except for improved perpendicular access points, which may be no wider than 24 feet. Sites over 2 acres in size must retain a minimum of 50% of those trees with a DBH greater than 6 inches (inclusive of the required buffer). 
b)  Submitted plans shall include the following information: 
1)  Owner's name and address. 
2)  Closed property boundary showing bearing and distances of all property lines. 
3)  Limits of land disturbance activity. 
4)  Location of tree protection fencing. Tree protection fencing must be shown around the canopy drip line of any tree or stands of trees proposed to be saved for tree density credit on the site. Tree protection fencing must be indicated on the erosion control plans and grading plans, as well as the tree protection and landscape plans so as to ensure that tree protection areas are not disturbed. 
5)  24-hour emergency contact name and phone number. 
6)  Location of and detail for the truck exit (crushed stone pad). 
7)  Delineation and labeling of all required buffer zones. 
8)  Documentation of all existing trees with a DBH greater than 6 inches. 
c)  All timber harvesting activities shall be in accordance with the U.S. Clean Water Act, Section 404 and Recommended Best Management Practices for Forestry in Georgia. 
3.  Tree loss on any nonexempt parcel shall not be considered an exemption from this section. Trees shall not be removed without prior authorization of the Department of Development Services staff, unless loss occurred due to sudden weather conditions which create an imminent hazard condition. Dead, dying, diseased, infested or otherwise hazardous trees may be removed only after a notification of tree removal form has been submitted and the condition of the tree(s) is verified by city staff prior to removal. A decision on the notification of tree removal shall be issued as soon as possible but no later than 10 business days from receipt of all required documents. The following procedures shall be observed: 
a)  If the location of the tree(s) satisfies a specific requirement, such as trees required in vehicle use areas or buffers, trees must be replaced in such a way as to meet the minimum standards for that requirement. If this cannot be achieved, all such variance requests must be submitted to City Council for consideration. 
b)  If the removed tree satisfies the site density factor (SDF) only and not a specific location requirement, the following options are available: 
1)  Replace the tree(s) with a tree of equal size; however a 3-inch caliper tree shall be the maximum diameter tree required to be planted, regardless of the size of the tree removed. Replacement trees must be appropriate for the location on the site according to the approved species list. NOTE: This option is only available if a notification of tree removal has been submitted and approved prior to the tree's removal. 
2)  Provide a tree survey, complete with density calculations, for the entire site. If the density remaining on the site after the removal does not meet the minimum SDF, replacement will be necessary. 
3)  Payment into the City of Marietta Tree Replacement Fund according to Subsection 712.08M. for the loss in the removed tree's density. 
4.  The site density factor (SDF) is the minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed site (see Table D). This density requirement must be achieved whether or not a site had trees prior to development. The required unit density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees, or some combination of the 2. 
TABLE D. MINIMUM TREE  DENSITY CALCULATIONS 

 
;;ol2; a)\Existing density factor (EDF) is the density of existing trees to be preserved on a site. The EDF is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees to density units using Table E. 
TABLE E. DENSITY CREDIT  FOR EXISTING TREES 

 
b)  Replacement density factor (RDF) is the density of new trees to be planted on a site. Calculate the RDF by subtracting the EDF from the SDF. The density units given for each caliper size of replacement (new) trees is shown in Table F. Any number or combination of transplantable size trees can be used so long as their total density units will equal or exceed the RDF. 
DENSITY CREDIT  FOR PLANTED TREES 

 

 
c)  For additions to existing projects, the tree density requirements are calculated as noted above for only those areas in which new land disturbance is taking place. This density may be achieved using 1 of the following methods: 
1)  Calculate the area of any new land disturbance and add replacement trees based on that area (existing trees elsewhere on the site may not be counted with this option); 
2)  Base density requirements on the total site area and count any existing trees on the site (subject to all restrictions noted elsewhere in these standards). 
Ex: Sample Tree Density Calculation: 
(1)  A 2.2 acre site has a site density factor (SDF) of 2.2 x 17 = 37.4 
(2)  The existing density factor (EDF) of trees to be preserved is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees slated for preservation to density units as follows (all existing trees are assumed to be hardwoods): 

 
(3)  Replacement density factor (RDF) calculates the minimum density of new trees to be planted by subtracting the EDF from the SDF: 
RDF = 37.4 - 29.8 = 7.6 units required 
(4)  Tables F-1 and F-2 are used to determine the RDF as follows: 

 
d)  Specimen trees warrant special consideration and encouragement for preservation. In order to encourage the preservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, additional density credit will be given for specimen trees that are successfully protected during the land disturbance and construction process (Subsections I.3. and I.4.). Credit for any specimen tree thus saved shall be calculated at twice the assigned unit value shown in Table D. The following criteria are used by the Department of Development Services to identify specimen trees. Both size and condition criteria must be met for a tree to qualify. In order to obtain double density credit for specimen trees, a certified arborist must provide written verification that the tree(s) meets the following criteria prior to the issuance of a land disturbance permit. However, failure to continuously protect any specimen tree(s) during the construction process may result in the loss of the additional tree density credit, thereby rendering the previously approved tree protection and landscape plan void, and a new plan will have to be submitted for review and approval by the Department of Development Services. 

 
E.  Methods of Tree Protection. 
1.  The protective zone for designated tree save areas shall include no less than the total area beneath the canopy drip line of the tree(s). 
2.  Construction site activities such as material storage, concrete washout, burnhole placement, etc., may not encroach into designated tree protective zones. Any such activity within the designated tree protective zones may render the previously approved tree protection and landscape plan void, and a new plan will have to be submitted for review and approval by the Department of Development Services. 
3.  No disturbance shall occur within the protective zone of specimen trees or stands of trees without prior approval by the Department of Development Services. 
4.  The use of tree save islands and stands is encouraged over the protection of individual (non-specimen) trees scattered throughout a site. This will facilitate ease in overall site organization, increase the effectiveness of protection measures and prevent pathology. 
5.  Layout of the project site utility and grading plans should accommodate the required tree protective zones, which is defined as the area beneath the canopy drip line (See Figure A). Utilities must be placed between tree protective zones or incorporate those techniques described in Subsections I.3. and I.4. 
F.  Protective Barriers. 
1.  Prior to any land disturbance, active tree protective fencing shall be installed so that it surrounds the critical root zones of all protected tree zones, which is defined as the area beneath the canopy drip line (See Figure A). 
2.  Active protective tree fences must be at least 4 feet high and may be either a wood and post construction or orange polyethylene laminar safety fencing. 
3.  Passive forms of tree protection may be utilized to delineate tree save areas which are remote from areas of land disturbance. These areas must be completely surrounded with continuous rope or flagging (heavy mill. minimum 4 inches wide). 
4.  All tree protection zones (both active and passive) should be designated as such with "tree save area" signs posted visibly on all sides of the fenced area. These signs are intended to inform subcontractors of the tree protection process. Signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with tree protection standards are recommended for site entrances although the developer shall be held responsible for any violations found. 
5.  All specimen trees or stands of trees, or otherwise designated tree protective zones must be protected from the sedimentation of erosion control. Silt screening must be placed along the outer uphill edge of tree protective zones at the land disturbance interface and shall be backed by 12-gauge 2-inch x 4-inch wire mesh fencing in areas of steep slope. 
6.  All erosion control must comply with Article 7-8-12 of this ordinance. All tree fencing and erosion control barriers must be installed prior to and maintained throughout the land disturbance process and building construction and may not be removed until landscaping is installed. 
G.  Vehicle Use Areas. 
1.  Parking Lots: Interior landscaping of parking lots shall contain planter islands located so as to relieve the expanse of parking, provide shading and channel water runoff. 
a)  A maximum of 12 parking spaces in a row shall be permitted without a planter island. 
b)  Planter islands shall have a minimum of 125 square feet in area and shall contain at least 1 nonpine species tree having at installation a minimum caliper of 2 inches and 10 feet in height. This requirement may be waived in those instances in which facing parking rows are separated by a continuous island at least 5 feet in width containing at least 1 small or medium canopy tree every 20 feet. The remaining area shall be landscaped with appropriate materials. 
c)  Encroachment: Landscaped areas shall require protection from vehicular encroachment. Car stops shall be required should any tree trunk be placed within 2 feet of a curb. Car stops shall be required in all instances where parking is adjacent to a landscaped area and curbing is not provided, to prevent damage to any trees by automobiles. 
2.  Planted Strip/Border Area: The intent of the planted border areas is to create tree-lined roadways that improve the quality of the built environment for pedestrians and motorists alike. All trees in planted borders must be classified as "Road Frontage Street" trees in Table G-2. Border areas are required on both sides of the roadway where applicable. Pine species are excluded from parking islands and along streets or accessways. The remainder of the planted area shall be landscaped with appropriate materials. 
a)  Each area of the site which abuts any roadway, including public streets, private streets or improved accessways providing access to the interior of a development must provide a planted border parallel to the roadway as described below. Alleyways are excluded from any planted border requirements. 
TABLE G-1a. REQUIREMENTS FOR PLANTED STRIP/BORDER AREAS  (excluding single-family lots in  residential subdivisions) 

 
b)  Street trees for individual lots within residential subdivisions shall be required based on total lineal road frontage as described below. Trees must be planted as close to the 10-foot landscape strip/border as possible but in no case shall trees located outside the front setback (or major side setback in case of corner lots) to be counted as street trees. Parcels used for purposes other than residential lots (common areas, detention areas, community clubhouses, etc.) shall follow the regulations above (TABLE G-1a) for planted border areas. Trees must be medium or large canopy only and a minimum of 3-inch caliper. 
TABLE G-1b. REQUIREMENTS FOR PLANTED STRIP/BORDER AREAS IN  RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS 

 
c)  Landscaped border areas may be interrupted to provide perpendicular vehicular and/or pedestrian ingress and egress, maximum 24 feet wide. Driveway or accessway interruptions shall be excluded from the calculations of total lineal feet to determine the number of trees required. 
3.  In those instances where trees are planted closer than 5 feet from a public street or sidewalk, either concrete or HDPE (high density polyurethane plastic) root barriers must be installed. These root barriers must be a minimum of 30 inches deep, but depending upon the size, location and specie of tree to be planted, the Director of Public Works may require the root barrier to be 36 inches to 42 inches deep. (Other methods or types of root barriers, i.e., biobarriers, may be considered at the discretion of the Director of Public Works.) 
4.  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not issue and are not granted the authority to issue variances to any of the regulations relating to vehicle use areas as contained in this paragraph; all such variance requests must be submitted to City Council for consideration. 
H.  Encroachment. Most trees can tolerate only a small percentage of critical root zone loss. If encroachment is anticipated within the critical root zones of specimen trees, stands of trees, or otherwise designated protected tree zones, the following preventative measures shall be employed: 
1.  Clearing Activities: Roots often fuse and tangle among trees. The removal of trees adjacent to tree save areas can cause inadvertent damage to the protected trees. Wherever possible, it is advisable to cut minimum 2-foot-deep trenches (e.g., with a ditch-witch) along the limits of land disturbance, so as to cut, rather than tear, roots. Trenching may be required for the protection of specimen trees. 
2.  Soil Compaction: Where compaction might occur due to traffic or materials storage, the tree protective zone must first be mulched with a minimum 4-inch layer of processed pine bark or wood chips, or a 6-inch layer of pine straw. 
3.  Trenching: The installation of utilities through a protective zone should occur by way of tunneling rather than trenching. 
4.  Grade Changes: Moderate fill can be tolerated within a tree's critical root zone with the prior installation of an aeration system. A decrease in grade is best accomplished through the use of retaining walls or terracing. 
5.  When irreparable damage has occurred to trees within the tree protective zones, the trees must be removed and replaced with new trees of comparable unit value. 
I.  Remediation. Remedial site reclamation and tree care procedures shall be implemented when encroachment within protective zones has caused damage to either the tree or the tree's growing site and the damage is reparable. If encroachment is anticipated, these horticultural practices should be employed as preemptive measures to improve tree survival. 
1.  Once a tree has been damaged, it is advisable to delay pruning until the deadwood becomes evident (1—3 years). Pruning for deadwood removal is then recommended. The removal of live plant tissue from a damaged tree can accelerate decline. Pruning of root severed trees may reduce the possibility of wind throw. Trees which have not been affected by construction activities can be pruned for maintenance of the tree's health, appearance and safety. 
2.  Fertilizer applications will enhance the vigor of trees stressed by site disturbances, thereby promoting root development. 
3.  A tree's adequate root development, and ultimately its chances for survival, is improved with reclamation of the growing site. Whenever possible, the soil should be brought back to its natural grade. Compacted soils within the critical root zones of trees should be aerated. The air exchange, nutrient, and water holding capacities of soils can be improved with soil amendments. A 4- to 6-inch layer of mulch material, such as pine bark or wood chips, spread within the critical root zones of trees on construction sites, is extremely beneficial. 
4.  The availability of water to trees on construction sites should be monitored. If grade changes or excessive rain cause the accumulation of water near trees, steps must be taken to improve drainage. Conversely, if grade changes or prolonged periods without rain cause a drought situation, then irrigation may be necessary. 
J.  Revegetation. 
1.  The replacement of trees must occur if the EDF does not meet the calculated SDF. The quantity of replacement trees must be sufficient so as to produce a total site density factor which meets the requirements established in Subsection D.4. (Note: the terms "unit" and "tree" are not interchangeable). 
2.  Species selected for replacement must be quality specimens and ecologically compatible with the site. Table G-2 lists those species of trees generally acceptable for credit in density calculations based upon use or need. The Department of Development Services has information on trees and may accept alternatives to those listed in Table G-2. Pine species may only be planted in buffer or screening areas to the rear of the principal use and are specifically excluded from parking islands and along rights-of-way. No more than 50% of all new trees may be pine species, regardless of their planting location. 
3.  Any portion of the subject property which is within a utility power easement is required to meet the height standards of the controlling entity. These areas may be required by the city to have additional vegetation installed to compensate for these restrictions, subject to approval from the Department of Development Services. 
4.  All trees and landscaping shall be installed in a sound workmanlike manner and according to accepted planting procedures with quality materials as provided in literature from the Georgia Forestry Commission or the Georgia Extension Service. All landscaping shall be completed within 6 months after the date of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy; however, any required fencing shall be installed prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy. Should the landscaping not be completed in this period, it shall be deemed a violation of this section. 
5.  The owner, occupant, tenant or agent, shall be jointly responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping. Landscaping shall be maintained in a good condition so as to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance at least equal to the original installation. Any dead vegetation and landscaping material or any damaged nonliving landscaping materials shall be promptly replaced. 
K.  General Landscaping Requirements. Beyond tree protection and revegetation, the extent of permissible impervious surfaces and required landscaping are regulated through the standards of the controlling zoning district. Landscaping may include grass, hedges and trees as well as natural features. All site plans submitted for new construction or renovations to an existing building according to Subsection 712.08B. must contain a separate landscape plan which includes the following information: 
1.  The name of the project. 
2.  The name of the owner and/or developer. 
3.  The location of proposed building(s) and corresponding dimensions. 
4.  Spatial limits of land disturbance, clearing, grading and trenching. 
5.  All required undisturbed buffers, landscape strips and parking islands. 
6.  The location and listing of all specimen trees or stands of specimen trees. 
7.  Areas of tree protection and revegetation and all relevant tree density calculations. 
8.  The specific name and location of all materials to be planted or maintained on the site. 
9.  Procedures and schedules for the implementation, installation and maintenance of tree protection measures including, but not limited to, detail drawings of protective tree fencing (both active and passive) including signage and erosion control measures. 
10.  Planting and staking specifications. 
11.  The percentage of the total lot containing impervious surfaces. 
12.  The percentage of the total lot which shall remain undisturbed. 
13.  The percentage of the total lot devoted to landscaping. 
14.  The location of any utilities, easements, or signs. 
L.  Acceptable Tree Species. Table G denotes those species of trees which may be incorporated for full credit towards the tree replacement requirements of paragraph D. Other trees may be approved on a case-by-case basis provided they are large growing and ecologically compatible with the site. Revegetation plans containing at least 10 new trees must incorporate at least 3 separate tree species with no single tree species accounting for more than 50% of all newly planted trees. Pine trees can be utilized for screening and buffer areas only. All planting and replanting plans are subject to approval through the Department of Development Services. 
TABLE G-2. TREE SPECIES SELECTION LIST 

 
M.  Alternative Compliance. 
1.  The intent of the tree protection and landscaping ordinance is to insure that a minimum density of trees is maintained on all developed sites. Occasionally, this intent cannot be met because a project site will not bear the required density of trees. To provide an alternative in such cases, contributing to the City of Marietta Tree Replacement Fund according to the Tree Replacement Fund requirements is acceptable (see Section 4-2). The following standards have been established for administering the alternative compliance method: 
a)  The Department of Development Services must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall more than 75% of the required density units be met through alternative compliance. Documentation from a certified arborist or licensed landscape architect must be provided to assure that as many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site in question. 
b)  The land disturbance permit will only be issued after the Department of Development Services has approved the request for alternative compliance and received the necessary documentation and/or funds. 
2.  Tree Replacement Fund. As an alternative method of compliance, the City of Marietta will accept donations that will be used for the purposes of purchasing, planting and maintaining trees on public property. Funds may be used for the purchase of forested green space. Funds may also be used for the creation of landscape plans involving the planting of trees on public property. Calculations for donations shall be based on 2 2-inch caliper replacement trees, the value of which is identified in the City of Marietta Fee Schedule. This value shall represent the average size and cost of materials, labor and guarantee for trees planted within the city limits. To determine the appropriate contribution, first calculate the density factor deficit (DFD) or unit value that cannot be planted on the site. Divide the DFD by 0.3 (the unit value of a 2-inch caliper replacement tree) and multiply by the value identified in the City of Marietta Fee Schedule. 
Ex.: A 2.2 acre site has a required site density factor (SDF) of 37.4, an existing density factor (EDF) of 21.4 and can only accommodate a replacement density factor (RDF) of 9.0. 
Determine the density factor deficit (DFD) using the formula: DFD = SDF - EDF - Approved RDF 
In this example, DFD = 37.4 - 21.4 - 9.0 = 7 
Determine the acceptable contribution amount as follows: 7 ÷ 0.4 X $(value) = $ (contribution) 
3.  Fund Administration. The City of Marietta Tree Replacement Fund will be administered by the Department of Development Services. A quarterly report shall be submitted to the City Manager showing the amounts collected, amounts spent, and the types and locations of trees planted. The report will be made available to the Mayor and City Council upon their request. 
N.  Interior Landscaping of Vehicle Use Areas. If sufficient cause is demonstrated that the required trees within the 10-foot landscape strip or within planter islands cannot be met, then the plan must show a method of alternative compliance. Sufficient cause is deemed to be when enforcing any of the requirements for the 10-foot landscape strip and/or the planter islands would violate any state or federal law, any ordinance of the City of Marietta, or zoning stipulation specific to the applicant. Should the placement of the trees within the 10-foot landscape strip and/or within the planter islands conflict with any existing above or below-ground utilities, the Director of Development Services is hereby authorized to grant an administrative variance to allow 1 of the following solutions: 
1.  Specific trees conflicting with existing utilities may be relocated elsewhere within the 10-foot landscape strip, so long as the proposed location will not create potential crowding issues. 
2.  Specific trees conflicting with existing utilities may be relocated elsewhere on the site but within the front setback. 
3.  Full canopied tree species conflicting with existing above-ground utilities may be substituted for a fastigiated variety listed in TABLE G-2. 
4.  Payment into the Tree Replacement Fund for the appropriate size of tree (according to TABLE G-1.) using calculations specified under Subsection M.2. 
O.  Enforcement, Violations and Penalties. Enforcement of the provisions of this section shall be the responsibility of the Department of Development Services. If, after inspection of a project by the administrator or their designee, the plan materials installed on the site do not comply with the approved plan, the applicant and property owner shall be notified of such deficiencies in writing. If the administrator deems the deviations from the approved plan acceptable, they will so note, and the applicant, property owner, and/or representative will be required to submit a revised plan within 10 days showing the actual plantings. If, after inspection, the administrator or their designee determines the site does not comply with the approved plan and further determines it to be unacceptable, the applicant and property owner shall be notified in writing by the Department of Development Services of said violations, and given 10 days in which to correct all violations. Failure to make such corrections shall be a violation of this section. 
P.  Appeal. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the authority and duty to consider and act upon any application submitted for adjustment of standards provided herein, unless otherwise noted. In addition, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to hear and decide appeals from the decision of the Development Services Director.

712.09 - Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District. 
A.  Intent and Purpose. The Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District is established to enhance the quality and compatibility of development, to establish consistent architectural and design guidelines, to encourage the most appropriate use of land, and to promote safe and efficient movement of traffic. The district is deemed necessary to enhance the aesthetic and visual character of lands adjacent to main commercial corridors in and around Downtown Marietta. All applicable developments proposed within this District shall be subject to procedures, standards, and guidelines specified in the following sections, in addition to those standards pertaining to the particular zoning district in which the development occurs. In particular, the purpose of the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District is to better articulate positive visual experiences in Marietta's downtown area; to provide for the continued safe and efficient utilization of roads; to promote pedestrian mobility and safety; and to provide for the preservation of historically significant structures. This will be accomplished through evaluation of all applicable developments within the districts by City staff. Staff shall use the point system of specific criteria as described later in this section. It is the purpose of such review to determine whether the proposed plan meets the guidelines and other criteria of this ordinance. 
B.  Delineation of District. 
1.  The Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District shall include: 
a.  The rights-of-way and all parcels lying in whole or in part within 750 feet of rights-of-way line of any road designated as part of the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District. 
b.  Roads that are designated as part of the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District include Whitlock Avenue from Lindley Avenue to the westernmost intersection of Manning Road, Fairground Street from Birney Street to South Cobb Drive, Powder Springs Street from the South Marietta Parkway to the intersection of Laurel Springs Lane and Longwood Drive, Roswell Street from Haynes Street to U.S. 41, Atlanta Street from Waverly Way to South Cobb Drive, North Marietta Parkway from Kennesaw Avenue to Whitlock Avenue, and South Marietta Parkway from Whitlock Avenue to Powder Springs Street. 
2.  The boundary of this district shall be shown on the Official Zoning Map of the City of Marietta. 
3.  If the proposed development will not be visible from the principal thoroughfare of the overlay district once the project is completed, the Director of Development Services has the administrative authority to waive the design review of the development. Parcels of land directly abutting roads designated as part of the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay Ordinance listed in Subsection 712.09.B.1.b and developments that incorporate mixed-use components listed in Subsections 712.09.F.1 and 712.09.G.1 are not eligible for waiver of design review. 
C.  Relationship to Existing Zoning Districts. In all existing zoning districts located within the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District the regulations for the zoning district, other zoning codes, and the overlay district shall apply. In cases where there is a conflict between the regulations of the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District and other sections of the zoning ordinance the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District shall take precedence. 
D.  Developments Exempt From the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District. The following activities or uses shall be exempt from the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay requirements and development review, although they may be reviewed under separate administrative procedures where noted in this section or in other sections of the Marietta Municipal Code. 
1.  Nonconforming Structures. If a nonconforming structure is to be retained then the structure shall not be rebuilt, altered, or repaired if such construction would exceed 50% of its replacement cost. If rebuilding, alteration, or repair of a nonconforming structure exceeds 50% of the replacement cost then the building shall be required to conform to all provisions of the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District Ordinance. 
2.  Single-Family Residences on Individual Lots. All single-family structures located on single-family detached residentially zoned lots are exempt from this ordinance but shall comply with the provisions set forth in other sections of the Marietta Municipal Code. Compliance with these provisions shall be verified through the building permit process. Any single-family residential structure that is altered for commercial use shall comply with the provisions set forth in this ordinance. 
3.  Downtown Marietta Historic District. Properties that are contained within the Marietta Historic District as identified on the Official Historic Map of Marietta are exempt from this ordinance but shall comply with Article 7-8-8 of the Marietta Municipal Code. 
E.  Design Plan Administrative Review. 
1.  As part of the site planning process, administrative design review by staff is required to confirm that submitted documents conform to the requirements of this article. A checklist containing mandatory and optional elements of Sections 712.09.F.1, 712.09.F.2, 712.09.F.3, 712.09.G.1, 712.09.G.2, and 712.09.G.3 shall be used with a minimum score required to determine compliance with the Code. 
2.  The design review plan must contain the mandatory elements located in each subsection of the Design and Development Guidelines listed below. In addition, developments shall attain 50% of the possible point totals located in the Optional Elements categories of the Design and Development Guidelines listed below. Within the Optional Elements categories, items that are not applicable to a particular application shall not be considered in the base points for calculating percentages. 
F.  Design and Development Guidelines - Tier A. The general purpose of the Tier A design overlay is to encourage private development to display some of the basic features of a pedestrian-oriented downtown commercial corridor. Overlay conditions are intended to promote a continuous street front experience that engages the pedestrian and generates visual interest. 
1.  Land Use Patterns. 
a.  Optional Elements: 30 points maximum/15 points for approval. (Note: These optional standards in Section 712.09F.1.a. only apply for developments which incorporate mixed uses. This section is not applicable to single use developments.) 
(i)  Provide for a mix of uses and pedestrian oriented uses within each development or building. Store front shops, retail, office, professional services, townhomes, and condominiums are permitted uses within the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District when they are mixed together within a building or development. (+10) 
(ii)  Within a mixed-use building the ground level of buildings facing a right-of-way shall have a mix of the following uses: (+10) 
(1)  Retail; 
(2)  Restaurants; 
(3)  Cultural activities: 
(4)  Entertainment; 
(5)  Other service establishments similar to those listed above. 
(iii)  Within a mixed-use building all floors, excluding the ground floor of buildings facing a right-of-way, shall have a mix of the following uses: (+10) 
(1)  Office uses; 
(2)  Residential units. 
(iv)  Auto-oriented developments are discouraged including the following: (-10) 
(1)  Gas station; 
(2)  Vehicle rental and/or sales; 
(3)  Title pawn; 
(4)  Uses similar in nature to those listed above. 
b.  Mandatory Elements: 
(i)  The maximum floor area ratio for developments that do not include residential components is the standard stipulated in the underlying zoning district. 
(ii)  The maximum floor area ratio for mixed-use developments containing residential and commercial or office components within the same development is 2.0. In order for a development to be considered a mixed-use project it must meet all provisions set forth in the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District Ordinance, Subsection F.1. 
(iii)  Projects that do not meet the above-mentioned criteria for mixed-use developments shall be allowed only the permitted uses stipulated in the underlying zoning district. For example, individuals cannot build an exclusively residential development on a parcel zoned for commercial or office use. 
(iv)  Developments that incorporate a mixture of residential and commercial or office uses shall have at least 30% of the floor area dedicated to residential use. 
(v)  Developments that incorporate a mixture of residential and commercial or office uses shall have at least 20% of the floor area dedicated to commercial or office use. 
(vi)  Residential units are not allowed on the ground floor of any mixed-use development in a building that is fronting all streets listed in Subsection 712.09.B.1.b. The intent of this is to ensure the commercial character of the corridors. 
(vii)  The maximum number of residential units on a lot shall be 1 unit for each 1,742 square feet of lot area. 
(viii)  Ninety-five percent of all residential units within a development shall be owner-occupied units. 
(ix)  The minimum floor area for individual residential units shall be as follows: 
(1)  Nine hundred square feet for 1-bedroom units. 
(2)  One thousand one hundred square feet for 2-bedroom units. 
(3)  One thousand four hundred square feet for 3-bedroom units. 
(x)  When fronting a street listed in Subsection 712.09.B.1.b, the frontage of the first floor of parking structures or garages shall be dedicated to commercial use, excluding ingress and egress. Also, when the upper stories of parking garages are visible from streets listed in Subsection 712.09.B.1.b, techniques and designs shall be used that disguise the appearance of the parking garage or structure and have an exterior finish and facades shall be made of wood, masonry, stone, or a combination of these. 
(xi)  Commercial and office uses shall be designed and operated so that neighboring residents are not exposed to offensive noise, especially from late-night activity. No amplified music shall be audible to neighboring residents. Common walls between residential and nonresidential uses shall be constructed to minimize the transmission of noise and vibration. 
(xii)  All outdoor lighting associated with commercial uses shall be designed so as not to adversely impact surrounding residential uses, while also providing a sufficient level of illumination for access and security purposes. Such lighting shall not blink, flash, oscillate, or be of unusually high brightness. Also, parking areas shall be illuminated so as to provide appropriate visibility and security during hours of darkness. 
(xiii)  All storage and work performed within the overlay district shall be conducted within a permanent opaque building that needs to conform to all provisions of the building design section of the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay Ordinance. 
(xiv)  Loading or service areas including refuse and recycling must be out of public view and must not front onto the primary street. 
(xv)  No commercial use shall be designated or operated so as to expose residents to offensive odors, dust, electrical interference, and/or vibration. 
(xvi)  Residential, commercial, and office uses in a mixed-use development shall provide combined and private bulk sanitation service for the entire development. 
(xvii)  Electric and communications transformers shall be screened from public view through below grade installation, a hedge, or similar measure. 
(xviii)  All other mechanical equipment must be behind or on top of the building and screened from public view through use of a parapet wall or through landscaping. 
2.  Site Design. 
a.  Optional Elements: 245 points maximum/123 points for approval. 
(i)  Where a building is on a corner lot or has frontage on 2 abutting streets, the design of the structure should have an angled entrance located at the street corner. (+15) 
(ii)  In order to create a sense of enclosure and defined space, buildings shall be arranged so that they frame and define the fronting streets giving deliberate form to streets and sidewalk areas. Defining the street is done by ensuring that neighboring buildings, when the neighboring building meets the standards set forth in the Commercial Corridor Design Overlay District, are setback a similar distance visually from the right-of-way, where applicable. (+15) 
(iii)  As a method to maximize greenspace in the corridor, adjacent property owners should coordinate greenspace between lots so that smaller segments of greenspace can be combined to create large open space areas. (+30) 
(iv)  Preserve specimen trees and/or significant tree stands as a method to produce shade and reduce the heat island effect. (+15) 
(v)  One curb cut is allowed per property. For every 500 feet of road frontage an additional curb cut is allowed. The purpose of this provision is to ensure efficient and effective traffic flow. The Director of the Public Works Department may waive this condition based on site conditions. (+30) 
(vi)  Developments with more than 1 curb cut per property. (-30) 
(vii)  Parking shall be located in the rear yard of properties. If rear yard parking is not possible due to irregularly shaped parcels then parking in the side yard shall also be permitted. (+20) 
(viii)  Parking in the front yard of properties or directly between a building and the primary public right-of-way. (-20) 
(ix)  Access parking through rear of the property (alleys), where possible. (+5) 
(x)  One non-pine shade tree shall be planted every 10 parking spaces. The planter islands shall have a minimum of a 125 square foot planter island. (+15) 
(xi)  Driveway width of 20 feet (not including curb and gutter) as a way to create a safe environment for both vehicles and pedestrians. (+5) 
(xii)  Provide pedestrian walkways through parking areas to the sidewalk/main entrance. (+15) 
(xiii)  Create inter-parcel access between adjacent lots to increase mobility options for vehicles and pedestrians. (In some cases the ability to provide inter-parcel access may not be successfully achieved due to conflicts with the neighboring property or property owner, and not by physical or topographical issues. In such cases, installing a driveway to the neighboring property and providing a recorded easement that will allow inter-parcel access to the neighboring property in the future is sufficient to achieve the points.) (+30) 
(xiv)  Enter into a shared parking agreement (access easement) with adjacent uses. In addition, properties with shared parking agreement receive a 10% reduction in the required number of parking spaces. (+30) 
(xv)  Provide bicycle parking facilities. (+5) 
(xvi)  Outdoor dining areas and public art are encouraged at building fronts, where applicable. Outdoor dining facilities are to be located on private property except for those properly licensed in accordance with the Outdoor Cafe Ordinance, Marietta Code Chapter 8-39. (+15) 
b.  Mandatory Elements: 
(i)  A 16-foot maximum front setback from the building to the property line along any public street. If part of the building must be set back from the sidewalk, treat these portions of the building as a plaza or courtyard. No more than 25% of a building frontage may be designed as a plaza or courtyard. 
(ii)  A 25-foot setback is required where the rear property line directly abuts a single-family residential district. Parking may occur within the required 25-foot setback as long as a screening fence or wall not less than 6 feet in height and made of wood, stone, brick is installed within the required buffer. 
(iii)  A 6-foot minimum side setback is required between a building and the side property lines and between the building and a public right-of-way. No side setbacks are required for buildings within the same development. 
(iv)  If parking occurs within the side yard of a property, a landscaped buffer of 10 feet shall be required to separate the parking facility from the adjacent parcel. Landscaping shall not be required in the areas designated for inter-parcel access. 
(v)  A 5% minimum open space per lot if the property is a mixed-use development. 
(vi)  A 95% maximum impervious surface per lot if the property is a mixed-use development. 
(vii)  Drive-through uses shall comply with the following design standards: 
(1)  A drive-through facility shall be limited to 1 driveway crossing of a pedestrian route, but shall not be limited in the number of service windows, bays, or lanes within the site provided the minimum floor area ratio of the district is met. However, if an applicant can demonstrate that construction of a single joint-use driveway is constrained by the size of the parcel, by unusual topographic or otherwise site considerations such that the project as a whole would be uneconomic and would otherwise be built, or if the return routing to such a joint-use driveway would require drive lane to be constructed parallel to and within 15 feet of a major pedestrian route that could otherwise be avoided, then a drive-through use may have separate ingress and egress driveways crossing a pedestrian route. 
(2)  The drive-through service window, bay, or lane and all queuing lanes shall be located as far as practicable from any right-of-way, or pedestrian route. 
(3)  If a drive-through facility is within 50 feet of a pedestrian route and queuing lanes and service windows, bays, or lanes would otherwise be visible from the pedestrian route, landscaping shall be installed to screen the service windows, bays, or lanes from view. 
(4)  Pedestrian circulation within the site shall be well marked, both for the operator of a vehicle and for the pedestrian, and shall comply with the requirements of the American with Disabilities Act. 
(viii)  Parking facing a right-of-way or improved accessway shall meet the requirements of Section 712.08.G of the Tree Protection and Landscaping Ordinance. 
(ix)  Any building abutting a public right-of-way shall be oriented to the street. The primary entry or entries for all ground-floor units abutting the street shall open directly onto the street right-of-way, not to the interior of the site or to a parking lot. Secondary entrances may face parking lots or other interior site areas. 
3.  Building Design. 
a.  Optional Elements: 
(i)  Roofs should reflect the traditional character of Marietta and provide visual interest for pedestrians, which involve the following: 
(1)  Flat roof styles are preferred because it is the traditional style of Marietta buildings. (+25) 
(2)  Shed roofs (single pitch) are not preferred because they do not fit the predominant architectural style of the city. (-25) 
(3)  Decorative cornice lines shall be incorporated to clearly identify the top of the building. (+15) 
(4)  Occupied roofs, such as roof gardens, terraces, decks and balconies are encouraged. (+10) 
(ii)  Building facades should reflect traditional patterns and provide visual interest for the community. 
(1)  Clearly delineate upper and lower facades by using cornice lines, stringcourses, canopies, awnings, fenestration, and other architectural elements to create a recognizable base, middle, and top of buildings. (+25) 
(2)  Entryways are important to a pedestrian environment and provide a special opportunity to make a building unique while at the same time providing a highly visible customer entrance and identifiable public address. Awnings or a change in the roofline shall be used as a way to define the entry of buildings facing right-of-ways. (+15) 
(3)  Recessed doorways are encouraged. Doorways should not be recessed more than 5 feet from the front facade unless a courtyard, cafe, window display, or similar space is provided between the doorway and the sidewalk. (+5) 
(4)  Street facades shall incorporate visual interest. Developers should use bays, storefronts, entrances, columns, and other vertical elements to "break-up" the building facade. (+15) 
(5)  Long, monotonous, or uninterrupted horizontal stretches of street-facing building facades shall be avoided. (-15) 
(6)  Storefronts shall incorporate display windows, transoms, and/or entrances that account for 50% of the ground level of building. (+10) 
(7)  The upper stories of all street-facing facades shall contain at least 30% opening through the use of windows, bays, porches, or other similar architectural elements. The aforementioned openings shall not exceed 75% of the street-facing facades. (+10) 
(8)  Pedestrian lighting shall be used for entryways at a height of 10 feet or less. The pedestrian lighting shall also use techniques and mechanisms to reduce the glare caused by the lighting fixtures. (+5) 
(9)  Heavily tinted windows are discouraged. The maximum reflexivity of any window shall not exceed 13%. (-10) 
(10)  Windows shall incorporate decorative architectural designs including the following: 
(a)  Sills. (+10) 
(b)  Trim. (+10) 
(c)  Lintels. (+10) 
(11)  Windows that do not incorporate any above-mentioned design features are discouraged. (-10)

712.10 - Purpose. 
A.  Purpose and Intent The Conservation Subdivision Overlay (CSO) District is intended to allow flexible site planning and building arrangements under a unified plan of development so that innovative land planning methods may be utilized which foster natural and cultural resource conservation. This may permit buildings to be clustered or arranged in an unconventional manner to maximize open space, create pedestrian scale and other public benefits. The CSO district is intended to: 
1.  Provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure. 
2.  Provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land. 
3.  Preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat. 
4.  Permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils, which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development. 
5.  Reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development. 
6.  Promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community. 
7.  Promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions. 
8.  Encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood. 
9.  Encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries. 
10.  Promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles. 
11.  Conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space. 
12.  Preserve important historic and archaeological sites. 
B.  Definitions: The following definitions are intended for use with the Conservation Subdivision Overlay District, in addition to those expressly defined in Section 724.02 of the City of Marietta Zoning Ordinance: 
1.  Impervious Surface - A man-made structure or surface which prevents the infiltration of stormwater into the ground below the structure or surface. Examples are buildings, roads, driveways, parking lots, decks, swimming pools, or paved patios.

712.11 - Residential Infill Development Overlay District. 

A.  Purpose and Intent. It is in the public interest to maximize efficiency of the utilization of public services, infrastructure, and facilities as a means to achieve balanced growth and to provide a cost-effective method for municipal service delivery. Within the residential areas of the identified urban core of Marietta, there exists an opportunity to achieve maximum utilization of land resources that have been bypassed or underutilized in the development of the urban area. An increase in the density normally allowed by the underlying zoning district is deemed an appropriate incentive to promote infill development and redevelopment within this urban core for single-family residential detached districts. 
The specific objectives of this ordinance as related to infill development and redevelopment in the identified urban core of Marietta are: 
•  Accommodate growth by encouraging and facilitating new single-family housing on vacant and underutilized land, in areas that already have infrastructure, utilities, and public facilities, while addressing the needs of Marietta's residents; 
•  Accommodate growth by encouraging and facilitating new single-family housing on properties currently developed as duplex units; 
•  Accommodate growth by aligning zoning and land use in a manner that is consistent with trends in urban redevelopment; 
•  Encourage efficient use of land and public services in the context of existing communities; 
•  Provide flexibility in development standards to facilitate infill development and redevelopment; 
•  Encourage construction of housing in close proximity to employment and services; 
•  Promote neighborhood preservation and enhancement through redevelopment of blighted, distressed and underutilized properties. 
B.  Applicability. This district implements the Infill Development Zone (IDZ). The provisions of this district apply to all residential parcels designated within the IDZ and within designated redevelopment areas. The boundary of this district shall be shown on the Official Zoning Map of the City of Marietta and all parcels contained within the zone, which meet the eligibility section below, are able to utilize the provisions set forth in this ordinance. 
All land uses and development, including but not limited to buildings, driveways, parking areas, streets, buffers, tree protection/landscaping, and pedestrian/bicycle ways, shall be located and/or provided for in accordance with the provisions of the zoning ordinance and land development regulations, except as modified by this chapter. 
C.  Eligibility. Properties may use the IDZ ordinance if they meet the following criteria: 
•  Parcels created by legal division, testamentary procedure, or laws of descent prior to April 11, 1984; and 
•  Parcels whose gross size is 2 acres or smaller; and 
•  Parcels that can and will be served by public water and sewer; and 
•  Parcels that have a residential zoning designation; and 
•  Parcels identified in the applicability section of this ordinance. 

D.  Relationship to Existing Zoning Districts. All provisions of the City Code that would apply to a non-infill project shall also apply to infill projects unless specifically modified in this ordinance. The developer of property that falls within the area covered by this ordinance may choose to develop his/her property using these standards. If the developer chooses to use the standards set forth in this ordinance then the standards of this section shall take precedence over those of the underlying zoning designation and other sections of the zoning ordinance, unless otherwise stated herein. If the developer chooses to use the standards of the underlying zoning designation, the standards of this ordinance will not apply to his/her property. 
E.  Exclusions. The following activities shall be excluded from use of the Infill Development Zone (IDZ) requirements and development review, although they may be reviewed under separate administrative procedures where noted in this section or in other sections of the Marietta Municipal Code. 
•  Non-Residential Property. All non-residentially zoned lots are excluded from this ordinance but shall comply with the provisions set forth in other sections of the Marietta Municipal Code. Compliance with these provisions shall be verified through the building permit process. 
•  Marietta Historic Districts. Properties that are contained within a locally designated historic district as identified on the Official Historic Map of Marietta or the Official Zoning Map of Marietta are exempt from this ordinance but shall comply with all other municipal codes that pertain to this property. 
F.  Permitted Uses. Permitted uses for individuals using this ordinance shall be the same as those allowed under the R-4 zoning designation. 
G.  Temporary/Conditional Uses Allowed by the Director. Temporary or conditional uses for individuals using this ordinance shall be the same as those allowed under the R-4 zoning designation. 
H.  Special Uses Permitted by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Special uses permitted by the Board of Zoning Appeals for individuals using this ordinance shall be the same as those allowed under the R-4 zoning designation. 
I.  Special Uses Permitted by the City Council. Not applicable in this district. 
J.  Accessory Structures. Accessory structures for individuals using this ordinance shall be the same as those allowed under the R-4 zoning designation, except that all accessory structures shall be set back at least 5 feet from the side and rear lot lines. In no case may the accessory structure be closer to any right-of-way than the principal building. In cases where the accessory structure is more than 15 feet in height, any window that has visibility to a directly adjacent property shall have obscured windows that do not allow visibility to the directly adjacent property. 

K.  Use Limitations. Use limitations for individuals using this ordinance shall be the same as those allowed under the R-4 zoning designation. 
L.  Infill Development Application Procedures. All applicants submitting for development approval through the Infill Development Zone Ordinance shall follow the following procedures and standards as set forth herein.

(Ord. No. 6651, 4/14/2004, § 1; Ord. No. 6991, 9/13/2006, § 1; Ord. No. 7853, § 1, 10/14/2015) 
DIVISION 714 - SIGNS[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 7867, § 1, adopted Jan. 13, 2016, amended Div. 714 in its entirety to read as set out herein. Former Div. 714, §§ 714.01—714.09, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 7710, § 1, adopted Dec. 11, 2013. 

714.01 - Findings and purpose. 
The City of Marietta makes the following findings of fact: 
A.  The City of Marietta finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of signs tends to proliferate, with property owners desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises. 
B.  Regulation of the size, height, number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety, to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the city, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the City's citizens. 
C.  The City further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such nearly all governmental signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. The Mayor and City Council finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations. Even where signs serve a propriety purpose, such as identifying markings on utility poles, public utility signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there may be temporary losses of power. 
D.  The City finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of providing addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Signs at the entrances to subdivisions or major developments favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this division, the provisions of this division are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners. The City further finds that holiday decorations such as strings of light are not signs, but rather seasonal ornamentation not controlled by this division. 
E.  In considering the appropriate level of sign regulation for the City, the Mayor and City Council has considered planning studies, reports, news articles and related information from a variety of sources. The Mayor and Council has determined that digital signs pose unique and substantial hazards to traffic caused by a higher level of distractibility than non-digital signs. In addition, digital signs are inconsistent with the aesthetic standards established for the City. 
These standards are intended to: 
A.  Promote signs that are subordinate to and in aesthetic harmony with their location on buildings and their surrounding environment; 
B.  Identify requirements that safeguard life, public health, aesthetic quality and welfare by regulating the location, size, number, illumination, construction, maintenance and quality of materials of all signs and eliminate visual clutter and blight within the City. 
C.  Promote the safety of persons and property by providing that signs do not create traffic or other hazards due to collapse, fire, visual obstruction, decay or abandonment. 
D.  Promote and encourage designs that reflect the appropriate scale, historic character, and pedestrian orientation of the city, as well as encourage designs that reflect the architectural scale, aesthetic quality, and vehicular and pedestrian orientation of commercially zoned districts within the City. 
(Ord. No. 7867, 1/13/2016, § 1) 
714.02 - Permit requirements. 
The following requirements and limitations shall apply with regard to signs, in addition to provisions appearing elsewhere in the text of these regulations or in the schedule of zoning district regulations: 
A.  Unless specifically exempted from obtaining a permit by other provisions of this division, any property owner, business, tenant, agent, or contractor shall be required to obtain a permit prior to the erection, replacement, reconstruction, or relocation of a sign. Where a building permit is required for sign installation, the building permit shall be obtained from the Public Works Department with input from the Department of Development Services and shall constitute the sign permit. If no building permit is required, the sign permit shall be obtained from the Department of Development Services. The tenant must have a current license to do business in the City at the location where the erection, replacement, reconstruction, or relocation of a sign is to take place. However, when a business is to be located at a newly constructed site or a site under reconstruction, a permit for a sign may be obtained prior to the issuance of a business license. Agents or contractors actively erecting or maintaining signs must have a license to do business in the State of Georgia. 
B.  Each application for a sign permit shall contain the following information: 
1.  Name of property owner, tenant and agent. 
2.  Name of sign owner (if different from property owner). 
3.  Name, address, and telephone number of the sign erector/contractor. 
4.  Freestanding signs require scaled drawings detailing the location of any structure on the lot upon which the sign is to be attached or erected and the exact position of the sign in relation to nearby buildings or structures and to nearby streets. Also, freestanding signs require that elevation plans be provided that show the dimensions, schematics, materials, and all other information that shows the design of the sign. Wall and other signs require scaled building elevation plans and detailed schematics to be submitted that detail the size of the building face and the location of the sign on the structure and the materials and design of the sign. 
5.  Plans, specifications and structural details of construction and attachment to the building or in the ground. A single submission may be permitted for standardized signs. All signs must conform to the standards of the current National Electrical and Standard Building Codes issued at the time of application and/or other codes of the City that may be applicable. The applicable issues of the Standard Building Code and National Electrical Code, as amended, are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein, a copy of which shall be maintained on file with the City Clerk for inspection and review by the public. The Chief Building Official shall be responsible for enforcing the guidelines set forth in the Standard Building Code and the National Electric Code. 
6.  Permit Fees. Permit fees are required for all sign permits. The permit fees for signs are established from time to time by the Mayor and City Council and are identified in the City of Marietta Fee Chart. 
C.  Upon receipt of a properly completed sign permit application as identified in Section 714.02B., the sign permit application shall be examined and either approved or denied within 45 business days or else the application shall be deemed granted on the 46th business day. All permit applications meeting the standards of this division and all applicable zoning regulations shall be granted. 
D.  The City shall deny permits to applicants who submit applications for signs that do not comply with the provisions of this division, are incomplete, or contain any material false statements. 
E.  Should it be determined that a sign permit was issued pursuant to an incomplete application or an application containing a false material statement, or that a permit has been erroneously issued in violation of this division, the permit shall be revoked by the same officer who issued the permit. The City is further authorized and empowered to revoke any permit issued by it upon failure of the holder thereof to comply with any provisions of this division within 10 days of the receipt of written notice to the property owner or the refusal of the property owner to accept the written notice. 
F.  Upon denial of the sign permit application or revocation of a sign permit, the applicant and/or permit holder shall be given written notice from the Department making the sign permit decision, stating the reason for the denial or revocation. Upon denial of the sign permit application or revocation of the permit, the applicant or permit holder may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals (or in the case of billboards, appeal shall be made to Mayor and City Council) within 10 days of the receipt of notice of the final decision of the Department making the denial decision. The appeal hearing shall take place within 60 days of the filing of the appeal with the City Clerk with final decision to be rendered no later than 30 days from the close of hearing. 
(Ord. No. 7867, 1/13/2016, § 1)

The numerical address of the property must be included on the sign, and must be clearly visible and legible from the street on which the property fronts. Numbers should be no less than 6 inches high and shall not be considered signage, nor shall they be included in the calculation of sign size. 
4.  Digital signs. Digital Signs may be used in accordance with the following provisions, provided that billboard signs shall not be converted to digital except in accordance with the provisions of Section 714.04G. The following shall apply to all digital signs: 
a.  Digital signs are prohibited in residential zones and within 200 feet of any residential property line. However digital signs shall be allowed in residential zones for places of assembly that have been granted a Special Land Use Permit by the Marietta City Council provided the digital sign is located beyond 200 feet of any residential property line.

d.  Digital signs shall contain static messages only and shall not have movement nor flashing on any part of the sign structure, design, or pictorial segment of the sign, nor shall such sign have varying light intensity during the display of any single message. Transitions between messages shall not use frame effects or other methods which result in movement of a displayed image during such transition. 
e.  Each individual static message must be displayed for a minimum of 20 seconds. 
f.  Digital signs are prohibited from projecting beams or rays of light of such intensity or brilliance as to cause glare or to impair the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or obscure or interfere with the effectiveness of an official traffic sign, device, or signal. 
g.  Each sign must have a light sensing device that will adjust the brightness of the display as the natural ambient light conditions change.

j.  City of Marietta staff may request a certification of the brightness (under measurement conditions) by an independent contractor (if such has not been certified within the preceding 12 months). If this investigation and certification indicates that the digital sign exceeds the brightness levels specified in this division, the owner of the sign, within 24 hours of a request by the staff of the City of Marietta, shall turn off the sign until the brightness of the sign is corrected to comply with this division at owner's expense. 
k.  No digital sign shall utilize, house or contain any interactive features or components, or function as an interactive sign.

Billboards are not allowed outside of the area within 100 feet of the right-of-way of Interstate 75. 
1.  Billboards shall also be regulated as a principal use and are required to meet all dimensional standards of the applicable zoning district. All distances shall be measured to the nearest point of the sign. The applicant is required to file an exemption plat through the City of Marietta with the Cobb County Superior Court to designate the area on the property that is to be used for the purpose of the general advertising or off-premises sign billboard. 
2.  No billboard shall be placed within 500 feet of a residential zoning district, church, school, park, public building or cemetery on the same side of Interstate 75 that the billboard is to be located on. 
3.  No billboard shall contain a sign area in excess of 672 square feet. 
4.  No billboard shall contain more than 2 faces; nor shall any multi-message billboard be allowed, including signs that contain tri-vision panels or other changeable faces, electronic message boards, LCD, LED or plasma panels or screens, or any similar electronic signage devices or technology, unless as strictly regulated in this Section 714.04G. 
5.  No billboard shall be located within a 1,000-foot radius of another billboard. 
6.  No billboard may exceed 70 feet in height along an interstate as measured from the established road grade at the nearest point of the aforementioned road. 
7.  When it can be demonstrated that a reduction of the required setback for a billboard is necessary in order to preserve trees along interstate right-of-way, the Director of the Department of Development Services may administratively reduce the setback by up to 50 percent. In order to ensure that no trees will be cut in locating or erecting such outdoor advertising signs, the applicant and/or landowner must provide a survey to identify those trees to be preserved. Failure to preserve any trees so identified shall be considered a violation of this article. In addition, GDOT approval must be obtained by the applicant. 
8.  No billboard shall be located or erected on a substandard lot. In addition, billboards shall meet all other zoning district regulations, including required setbacks and lot widths. Support structures shall meet the setback requirement; however sign faces may extend 25% into any required setback. All distances shall be measured to the nearest point of the sign. 
9.  No billboard shall be located or erected on a lot upon which a building is located if such lot or the building thereon has any sign located thereon. 
10.  No billboard may be located closer to a permanent structure than a distance that is equal to or greater than the height of the sign. 
11.  Billboards shall be permitted in LI, HI, CRC, RRC, PCD, and OHR zoning districts. Billboards are prohibited in all other zoning districts. 
12.  Billboards shall not be permitted within any right-of-way or easement provided for a railroad. 
13.  Digital billboards: 
a.  Purpose Statement for Digital Billboards: In addition to the other standards listed in the Purpose Statement of the Sign Ordinance (Section 714.01 Purpose) the Mayor and City Council find that the proliferation in number, size and manner of outdoor advertising unreasonably distracts motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians and promotes confusion with regard to traffic lights, signs, or signals or other interference with the effectiveness of traffic regulations and is therefore hazardous to roadway users; that the inadequately controlled proliferation of billboards visible from highways endangers the uniqueness of our City and our community and our scenic beauty; that tourism and trade from both resident and nonresident roadway users is an essential part of our economy; that tourist-oriented directional signs and logo signs erected pursuant to authority of the Georgia Department of Transportation offer businesses cost-effective means of announcing their presence to the highway users without harm to the City of Marietta's scenic beauty. 
1.  The erection and maintenance of new billboards should be strictly limited in areas adjacent to Interstate 75, and are prohibited in all other areas in order to protect the public investment in such roadways, preserve the City's scenic beauty and distinctiveness, and promote the general health and welfare of the public. 
2.  The Mayor and City Council find that the vast majority of billboards within the City of Marietta are legal non-conforming uses, and consistent with the provisions of Division 706 Non-Conforming Uses and Section 714.06C: Nonconforming Signs, it is the desire of the City of Marietta that such non-conforming uses be reduced over time. Despite this intent, the number of legal non-conforming signs has not been materially reduced in a significant fashion. 
3.  This division is adopted based upon concerns for the distractions that digital billboards can cause. However, the Mayor and City Council find that the modification of a limited number of existing static billboards to digital signs, in exchange for a reduction in the overall number of billboards achieves a net improvement in public safety and character. 
b.  Digital panel replacement for existing billboards within 100 feet of the right-of-way of Interstate 75 or U.S. Highway 41 shall be permitted provided applicants meet the following requirements: 
1.  An existing billboard panel may be replaced with a digital panel if no less than 4 existing billboard panels are removed in their entirety. An existing panel that is to be retrofitted with a digital panel(s) shall not count toward the aforementioned panel to be removed. 
2.  This removal must include the complete removal of the structure to the foundation supporting each sign face. The applicant must also agree that the sign will be removed voluntarily and that no right to compensation exists for the removed sign under any law. The applicant shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City from any legal actions taken by the property owner of existing sites in the implementation of this division. If the removed sign structure is one for which a state permit is required by state law, the applicant must surrender its permit to the state upon removal of the sign. 
3.  Multiple sign structures may be removed and counted for exchange if the sum of their sign panels is equal to or greater than 2,400 square feet. 
4.  If the applicant complies with the permit requirements noted above, the city will issue a billboard permit for the designated billboard. A building permit shall only be issued once all the required sign structures are removed. Except for the replacement of the sign face with the digital panel, and any associated structural improvements necessary and approved by the City of Marietta, the retrofitted legal non-conforming sign shall not be, moved, increased in size or height, or otherwise modified in contravention of this division. This permit will allow a digital display to occupy 100 percent of the potential copy and graphic area. The designated sign must: 
i.  Not be greater than 672 square feet; 
ii.  Not be located within 500 feet of a residential zoning district if located on U.S. Highway 41 or within 500 feet of a residential zoning district on the same side of Interstate 75 that the billboard is located; 
iii.  Not be more than 70 feet in height as measured at the nearest road grade if permitted along I-75, nor more than 35 feet in height as measured at the nearest road grade if permitted along U.S. 41; 
iv.  Be in full compliance with the Sign Ordinance Sections 714.02, 714.06, 714.07, 714.09 and meet all other requirements of Sections 12, 13 and 14 of this division. 
5.  Only billboard structures lawfully in existence on December 11, 2013 are eligible to contain digital panels, except as allowed under paragraph 15 of this section. 
6.  Unless approved otherwise by City Council, billboards removed as part of another government agreement, including right-of-way condemnation and/or a zoning condition, shall not count toward the removal threshold for this exchange program. 
14.  A digital billboard shall: 
a.  Contain static messages only, and shall not have movement, scrolling, fading or flashing on any part of the sign structure, design, or pictorial segment of the sign, nor shall such sign have varying light intensity during the display of any single message. 
b.  Every line of copy and graphics in a digital display must be at least 15 inches in height. If there is insufficient room for copy and graphics of this size in the maximum allowable sign area, then no digital display is allowed. 
c.  Digital billboards may not operate at brightness levels of more than 0.20 foot candles above ambient light levels as measured at the following distances: 

 
d.  The owner of said digital billboard shall arrange for an annual certification of the brightness showing compliance by an independent contractor and provide said certification to the City of Marietta. 
e.  Each digital billboard must have a light sensing device that will adjust the brightness of the display as the natural ambient light conditions change. 
f.  No digital billboard shall be located within 5,000 feet of another digital billboard on the same side of the road. 
g.  The owner of said digital billboard may coordinate with the local authorities to display, when appropriate, emergency information important to the traveling public including, but not limited to Amber Alerts or alerts concerning emergency management information. 
h.  The owner of said digital billboard shall provide to the City of Marietta information for a 24-hour contact able to turn off the electronic sign promptly after a malfunction occurs. If, at any time more than 50% of the digital display lights malfunction or are no longer working, the owner of said digital billboard shall make repairs to the sign within 60 days or the sign will require removal. 
i.  If the staff of the City of Marietta finds that the digital billboard exceeds the brightness specified in paragraph C. above, the owner of the sign, within 24 hours of a request by the staff of the City of Marietta, shall reduce the intensity of the sign to be in compliance with this division and provide said certification. 
j.  Each sign must comply with all Georgia Department of Transportation rules and regulations applicable to electronic changeable message signs, where not in conflict with this division. 
k.  A digital billboard existing on December 11, 2013 must comply with the operational standards listed above. 
15.  Unless allowed as part of an exchange agreement, new billboard structures located within 100 feet of the right-of-way of Interstate 75 may contain electronic message boards, LCD, LED or plasma panels or screens, or any similar electronic signage devices or technology, provided that such electronic sign face shall be limited to 672 square feet and the designated sign must meet all other requirements of this division. 
16.  All variance requests seeking relief from these standards must be made to City Council. Application shall be made through the Department of Development Services. 
(Ord. No. 7867, 1/13/2016, § 1) 
714.05 - Special conditions. 
There exist unique conditions that require greater diligence due to their ability to more greatly harm the public good by creating unsafe, unsanitary or unkempt conditions. As such, the City hereby imposes additional regulations and standards on the following types of signage. Unless otherwise noted, permits are required for all signs in this section. 
A.  Shopping Centers. In shopping centers and shared commercial buildings, individual tenants are entitled to wall, canopy and under canopy signage utilizing those standards noted previously in this section, calculated by tenant space. Individual tenants are not entitled to any freestanding signage on the premises, however, the property owner or manager may request 1 freestanding, monument based, sign for each property line which abuts public right-of-way provided the sign area is located at least 5 feet from any property line for a distance of at least 75 feet. The Public Works Director or his/her designee may require additional setback distances based upon site conditions for traffic safety. In instances where a shopping center has over 100,000 square feet of floor area and has multiple entrances, the property owner or manager may request 1 additional sign on a single road frontage, provided that both signs are located at entryways and that the entryways are located at least 300 feet apart. The maximum size of the sign shall be based upon the gross square footage of the shared center (exclusive of outparcels) as shown in Table I: 
TABLE I. DETACHED SIGNS STANDARDS FOR SHARED COMMERCIAL SPACE 

 
  *As defined on the Official Thoroughfare Map of the City 
 **Sign structures are limited to 100% of the allowable sign face 
***As defined on the Official Zoning Map of the City 
B.  Standard Informational Signs. Standard informational signs are permitted in all single-family residential districts subject to the following standards.

Each standard informational sign shall be set back from the right-of-way at least 1 foot, shall measure no greater than 6 square feet in sign area, be erected to a height of no more than 4 feet, and shall be composed of metal, plastic, laminated cardboard or other durable and waterproof material. Standard informational signs meeting these same standards are permitted on other residentially zoned properties, excluding multi-family zoning districts. 
C.  Gas Stations with Canopy Covering Pumping Area. Gas stations that incorporate a canopy covering the pumping area may place signage along the canopy eaves. Such signage may be placed on no more than 3 sides and is limited to 10 square feet per side. Signs forming an integral part of a gasoline pump do not require a permit. 
D.  Official State Emission Station. Each official state emission station shall be allowed to display signs meeting the standards of the Georgia Motor Vehicle Emission Inspection and Maintenance Act, O.C.G.A. § 12-9-40 et seq.

F.  Weekend Standard Informational Signs (WSJS). 
1.  Purpose. Many people travel to, from, and through the city on a daily basis. During the weekday rush hours when the majority of people on the roads are commuting to or from work, roads are often nearly beyond their capacity. Traffic hazards and distractions must be minimized. However, people at times need the benefit of directional signs to help find their destinations, particularly destinations of a temporary or time limited duration. Properly regulated, such directional signs may actually aid the flow of traffic while limiting the negative impact of such signs on the aesthetic qualities of an area. The following regulations recognize the difference in weekday and weekend traffic and are intended to promote and protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents, visitors and businesses of the city, including the aesthetics of the community. Improperly located weekend standard informational signs are hereby determined to pose an immediate safety threat and traffic hazard to members of the public traveling on City roads. 
2.  Weekend standard informational signs (WSIS) are allowed in nonresidential districts subject to the following standards.

This administrative variance must also be approved by the Public Works Director to ensure that the structure is not inhibiting vehicular and pedestrian visibility of the roadway. 
B.  Sign Inspections. The Director of the Department of Development Services may require the building inspector or other City Code Enforcement Officials to perform field inspections to determine that the sign being erected, replaced, reconstructed, expanded, relocated, or used is being pursued in accordance with the Standard Building Code and all other applicable ordinances for which a sign permit has been issued.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note— Section 1 of Ord. No. 6888, adopted Dec. 14, 2005, amended Div. 716 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Div. 716 pertained to the same subject matter and derived from the 1996 Code of Ordinances, §§ 7-8-2-14-190—7-8-2-14-220; and the 1998 Zoning Ordinance. 

716.01 - Purpose. 
These standards are intended to provide the reasonable provision of future off-street parking within the City of Marietta; to restrict temporary storage of vehicles and recreational vehicles in residential districts; to alleviate any unnecessary traffic congestion which could result from on-street parking; and to encourage development and usage of off-street parking facilities. 
(Ord. No. 6888, 12/14/2005, § 1) 
716.02 - Street access and curb cuts. 
A.  Each building shall be located on a lot or parcel which abuts a public street for at least 30 feet, or has the minimum lot frontage established by zoning, or has access to a public street by means of a recorded access easement if approved by the Development Services Director and Public Works Director. 
B.  Street access and curb cuts for service drives, entrances, exits and other similar facilities on public streets in other than residential districts shall be approved by the Public Works Director. Curb cuts constructed for new driveways to developments on arterial and collector streets shall be aligned directly across from existing curb cuts. The Public Works Director may approve other locations when it is determined that alignment with an existing curb cut is not appropriate. No curb cuts shall be located within 40 feet of any intersection or within 30 feet of another curb cut measured along the curb line. A curb cut shall be no greater than 30 feet in width, and no closer than 20 feet to any property line unless approved by the Public Works Director. 
C.  All entrances or exits of any street or drive, public or private, from or to any state highway shall be approved by the state highway department prior to the construction of such street or drive, or the issuance of any development permit for any improvement to be served by such street or drive. 
D.  No curb cuts for commercial developments may be placed along residential streets. 
(Ord. No. 6888, 12/14/2005, § 1) 
716.03 - Street improvements. 
A.  The Public Works Director may require improvements such as the widening of streets and/or rights-of-way or the addition of curbs and gutters, in order to accommodate the increased traffic due to proposed developments. 
B.  Existing streets shall be connected and extended throughout the limits of proposed developments. If such street is already used primarily for residential access, requested street improvements to provide access to a proposed nonresidential use must be approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals before being connected, extended or in any way provided access to the nonresidential use. 
(Ord. No. 6888, 12/14/2005, § 1) 
716.04 - Corner visibility clearance. 
In all districts except CBD, no fence, structure, sign, planting or other obstruction (above a height of 3 feet) shall be maintained within 15 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way unless approved by the Public Works Director. 
(Ord. No. 6888, 12/14/2005, § 1) 
716.05 - Private streets. 
Private streets within any district shall not be used to satisfy the off-street parking requirements of this article. Private streets within any district shall be assigned names and locations and names of such streets shall be shown on plans required for the issuance of building and development permits. All private street names shall be approved by the Development Services Director to avoid conflicting street names. Section 726.04 further controls private streets and their standards. 
(Ord. No. 6888, 12/14/2005, § 1) 
716.06 - Private alleys. 
The use of alleys may be deemed appropriate in specifically designated redevelopment areas according to the regulations set forth in this section. Private alleys should only be included within developments as a secondary means of access to the rear or sides of buildings, and should not be substituted as a primary street. The developer is required to install "No Parking" signs on all alleyways. All developments for which alleys are proposed shall be reviewed and approved by City Council at a regularly scheduled meeting as a separate item on the agenda. 
(Ord. No. 6888, 12/14/2005, § 1; Ord. No. 6917, 5/10/2006, § 1) 
716.07 - Parking spaces required. 
The required number of parking spaces shall be provided on the same lot with the use it serves, except: 
A.  If vehicular parking or storage space required cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal use is conducted, the Board of Zoning Appeals may permit such space to be provided on other off-street property, provided such space lies within 400 feet of the main entrance of such principal use and meets the storage requirements set forth in Section 710.07. Such vehicular parking space shall be associated with the permitted use and shall not hereafter be reduced or encroached upon in any manner. 
B.  The required parking spaces of any number of separated uses may be combined in 1 lot, but the required spaces assigned to 1 use may not be assigned to another use at the same time, except that churches, theaters, or assembly halls whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sunday may be assigned to a use which will be closed at night or on Sunday.

If a building or development contains multiple uses, the number of spaces required shall be calculated by summing the amount required by each individual use. Parking areas are encouraged to be set to the side or rear of the primary building in such a manner as to reduce visibility from the street (see individual zoning districts for density bonuses relating to parking location and/or structures). 
F.  If required parking is provided exclusively in the rear yard, then the required front yard setback may be reduced 50%. 
G.  Where parking spaces are provided in on-site underground or deck parking, a bonus floor area of 350 square feet for each provided parking space shall be allowed.

Before enacting an amendment to this article, the City Council shall give public notice and hold a public hearing thereon.

Unless initiated by the City Council or Planning Commission, all applications for map amendments must be submitted by the owner (as determined by controlling at least a 51% interest in the property) or the authorized agent of such property. An application for an amendment affecting the same property shall not be submitted more than once every 6 months; however, this provision shall not apply to those properties affected by an amendment filed by the City Council or Planning Commission. 
(Code 1996, § 7-8-2-22-010) 
722.02 - Application for map amendments.

1.  a legal description of the tract(s) proposed to be rezoned; 
2.  a plat showing the dimensions, acreage and location of the tract(s) prepared by an architect, engineer, landscape architect or land surveyor whose state registration is current and valid (his seal shall be affixed to the plat);

Such exemptions or reductions in occupation tax shall not be arbitrary or capricious and the reasons shall be set forth in the minutes of the public hearing of mayor and city council.

It is anticipated that the businesses of Marietta affected by this limitation will create more jobs and commerce within the jurisdiction of the City of Marietta.

D.  Upon the sale or other transfer of any interest in the business for which the license was issued, the purchaser or transferee of such interest shall be entitled to continue to operate such business for a period of no more than 60 days, pending the issuance of a new license, but only if such purchaser or transferee has filed an application with the city as required in Subsection A. In case of the death of any natural person holding a city business license, or any interest therein, the license may be transferred to the administrator, executor of the lawful heir or devisee of the deceased person by filing a new application with the city for the change in license ownership within 75 days of such death. The business involved may continue to operate until disposition of the application as determined as for an original licensee.

The safety inspection is a component of every baseline inspection. 
"Rental property" means all dwellings, dwelling units, and rooming units located within the city and rented or leased for any valuable consideration, but excludes dwellings owned by the federal government, the state or any of their agencies or political subdivisions and facilities licensed by the state as health care facilities.

CHAPTER 8-20 - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS

The purpose of this chapter is to regulate certain types of businesses, including but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed.

As to adult dance establishments, this chapter represents a balancing of competing interests: Reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons.

J.  A grantee shall on the request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the city temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of such building. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of the wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same and a grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. A grantee shall be given not less than 48 hours' advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. In the event of a disagreement between a grantee and a holder of a permit, such disagreement will be resolved by the city public works director. 
K.  If at any time in case of fire or disaster in the city it shall become necessary in the judgment of the mayor or the chief of the fire department to cut or move any of the wire cables, amplifiers, appliances or other fixtures of a grantee, this may be done and the repairs thereby rendered necessary shall be made by a grantee, at its own cost and expense and without charge against the city. Grantee shall not be penalized under this chapter for any delays or problems incurred in its cable operation as a result of such action by the city. 
L.  Grantee's work, while in progress, shall be properly executed at all times with suitable barricades, flags, lights, flares, or other devices as are reasonably required to protect all members of the public having occasion to use the portion of the streets involved, or adjacent property.

In any event, the picture produced shall be as good as the state of the art allows. In addition, the system should be capable of providing proper, undistorted monophonic and stereophonic sound. 
5.  The CATV system shall transmit or distribute signals of adequate strength to produce clear pictures with good sound in all television receivers of all subscribers without causing cross modulation in the cables or interference with other electrical or electronic systems. 
6.  That the CATV system as installed has a minimum capacity of 20 channels. 
C.  A grantee shall render efficient service, make repairs promptly and interrupt service only for such good cause and for the shortest time possible. Such interruptions insofar as possible shall be preceded by notice and shall occur during periods of minimum use of the system. If, for any reason, a grantee's cable systems service is interrupted for a continuous period of more than 24 hours, and the cause of the interruption is solely within the control of the grantee, the grantee shall provide a pro rata credit or refund for the service lost to any subscriber requesting the same.

For purposes of this section, it shall be presumed that there is sufficient demand for such separate PEG channels when the PEG channel(s) in operation is utilized for the purpose set forth in this section at least 80 percent of the time for an period of at least four consecutive weeks. At such time as there is such demand for an additional PEG channel, grantee shall make such additional PEG channel available; provided, however, under no circumstances shall grantee be obligated to make more than three channels available for PEG use. 
1.  If there is significant unused time on any PEG access channel which the grantee desires to use to provide an additional programming service, then grantee shall give written notice to the city council and city manager of the existence and amount of such significant unused time, together with a substantial summary of its records to demonstrate the same and a proposal for providing additional programming service on the PEG channel(s).

"Rental property" means all dwellings, dwelling units, and rooming units located within the city and rented or leased for any valuable consideration, but excludes dwellings owned by the federal government, the state government or any of their agencies or political subdivisions and facilities licensed by the state as health care facilities.

2.  Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prohibit the city from ordering interim relief to preserve the status quo pending a hearing. 
C.  Hearings and Determinations. 
1.  The hearing shall be conducted by the business license manager, an agent or by one or more hearing officers who have not personally determined the factual issues in controversy at the hearing and have no personal financial interest in the outcome of the hearing. In its discretion the business license manager may, but need not, appoint an employee of the city or other person possessing qualifications acceptable to the business license manager as a hearing officer to hear and receive evidence and render a decision on the law and the facts. The hearing officer has all the authority possessed by the business license manager to render decisions.

2.  The business license manager or hearing officer has authority to administer oaths and affirmations; sign and issue subpoenas; rule upon offers of proof; compel testimony; receive evidence; dispose of motions relating to the discovery and production of relevant documents and things for inspection, copying, or photographing; regulate the course of the hearing; set the time and place for continued hearings; fix the time for filing of briefs and other documents; direct the parties to appear and confer to consider simplification of issues, admissions of facts or documents to avoid unnecessary proof, and limitation of the number of witnesses; issue appropriate orders that control the subsequent course of the proceeding; dispose of motions; and control the decorum and conduct of the proceeding. 
3.  All testimony shall be taken under oath or by affirmation.

6.  Unless otherwise provided by city charter, ordinance, or code or by state or federal constitution or law, the proponent of an order has the burden of proof, and every party to the proceeding has the right to present such party's case or defense by oral and documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. The business license manager or hearing officer may receive all or part of the evidence in written form if the interests of the parties will not be prejudiced substantially and if the hearing will be expedited thereby. The rules of evidence and requirements of proof and procedure shall conform to the extent practicable to those in civil nonjury cases, but when necessary to ascertain facts affecting the substantial rights of the parties to the proceeding, the business license manager or hearing officer may receive and consider evidence not admissible under such rules if such evidence possesses probative value commonly accepted by reasonable and prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. The person conducting the hearing shall give effect to the rules of privilege required by law, may exclude incompetent and unduly repetitious evidence, and may receive documentary evidence in the form of a copy or excerpt if the copy is authenticated. The business license manager or hearing officer shall use its experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge in evaluating the evidence presented to it.

7.  The business license manager or hearing officer may issue a decision at the hearing and shall issue a written decision with findings of fact and conclusions of law, setting forth the grounds of the decision, based on the evidence presented at the hearing. The business license manager shall serve the decision on each party to the hearing by personal service or by mailing by regular mail, to the last address furnished to the business license manager by the party. The decision shall be effective as to such party on the date mailed or on such other date as is stated in the decision. 
8.  Unless otherwise provided by city charter, ordinance, or code or by state or federal constitution or law, the decision of the business license manager or hearing officer is final subject only to judicial review pursuant to writ of certiorari. No defense or objection may be presented for judicial review unless it is first presented to the business license manager or hearing officer, prior to the decision thereof.

All other calls to that location will be responded to normally by the Marietta Police Department. All alarms will be responded to normally once the alarm user's payment has been received.

I.  Confidentiality. To the extent allowed by law, information contained and gathered through the alarm registration process will be held in confidence by the City of Marietta. 
J.  Government Immunity. Alarm registration is not intended to, nor will it, create a contract, duty or obligation, either expressed or implied, of response.

3.  For the purposes of giving notice to the owner of the property, the person shown as the owner of said property on the City of Marietta tax records shall be sent such notice at the address shown thereon unless the city receives actual notice that another person owns said property. In addition, the owner may notify the city that the tenant, pursuant to a written lease, has control of the property or has control of that portion of the property which is the subject of this article and, in the event the city receives such notice, the city shall notify the tenant of the notice of removal as provided in this article and proceed against the tenant and not the owner.

4.  A property owner that has received proper written notice of the presence of graffiti on the property shall have 30 days from the date of that written notice to remove the graffiti themselves or through the use of a private contractor.

Any person, agent, firm, public agency, manager, or owner of the property that fails to remove the graffiti before the expiration of the 30 days following written notice as provided by this article shall be issued a citation to appear before the appropriate court in order to determine whether that person, agent, firm, public agency, manager, or owner of the property is in violation of the provisions of this article. Any person, agent, firm, public agency, manager, or owner of the property who violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, fined up to $1,000.00, for each violation and/or imprisoned for not more than six months, or both, and in addition shall pay all costs an expenses involved in each separate offense.

Sound level meter (SLM) is an instrument used to measure sound pressure levels conforming to Type 1 or Type 2 standards as specified in ANSI Standard S 1.4-1983 or the latest version thereof. 
Sound pressure level (SPL) is 20 multiplied by the logarithm, to the base ten, of the measured sound pressure in question divided by the sound pressure associated with the threshold of human hearing, in units of decibels. An A-weighted or C-weighted filter should be applied to the measurement as required. The sound pressure level measured value should be designated with the suffix dB(A) or dB(C) as required. 
Weekday is any day, Monday through Friday, that is not a legal holiday.

D.  Community Per Capita Crime Index. 
(1)  The chief of police shall calculate on a monthly basis the community per capita crime index for each registered apartment complex in the city. 
(2)  The community per capita crime index for an apartment complex is calculated as follows: 
(a)  Determine the total number of bedrooms in the apartment complex as designated in the most recent multi-tenant property registration application filed with the director for the property; 
(b)  Multiply the number of bedrooms by two (two occupants counted for each bedroom) to produce the ideal occupancy number for the property; 
(c)  Multiply the ideal occupancy number by the percent of units in the apartment complex that are occupied (as designated in the most recent multi-tenant property registration application filed with the director for the property) to produce the actual occupancy number; 
(d)  Divide the number of Part I crimes occurring on the property within the preceding 12 months by the actual occupancy number and multiply the result by 100 to produce the community per capita crime index for Part I crimes; 
(e)  Divide the number of Part II crimes occurring on the property within the preceding 12 months by the actual occupancy number and multiply the result by 100 to produce the community per capita crime index for part II crimes. 
(f)  Divide the number of Chapter 16 crimes occurring on the property within the preceding 12 months by the actual occupancy number and multiply the result by 100 to produce the community per capita crime index for Chapter 16 crimes.

(b)  Add together each apartment complex's crime index for Part I crimes and divide the sum by the total number of registered apartment complexes to produce the average crime index for Part I crimes. 
(c)  Subtract each apartment complex's crime index for Part I crimes from the average crime index for Part I crimes to get the apartment complex's deviation from the average crime index for Part I crimes. 
(d)  Add the square of each apartment complex's deviation from the average crime index for Part I crimes together and divide the sum by the total number of registered apartment complexes to produce the average squared deviation for Part I crimes. 
(e)  Take the square root of the average squared deviation for Part I crimes and add it to the average crime index for Part I crimes to produce the crime risk threshold for Part I crimes. 
(f)  Repeat the process using each apartment complex's crime index for Part II crimes and Chapter 16 crimes to determine the crime risk threshold for Part II crimes and Chapter 16 crimes, respectively. 
(3)  Example of calculation of crime risk threshold. 

 
Average crime index for Part I crimes = 120 □ 10 = 12 
Average squared deviation = 278 □ 10 = 27.8 
Standard deviation = □27.8 = 5.27 
Crime risk threshold for Part I crimes = 12 + 5.27 = 17.27 
(Note: To calculate the crime risk threshold for Part II crimes and Chapter 16 crimes, repeat the formula using the crime indexes for Part II crimes and then for Chapter 16 crimes.)
