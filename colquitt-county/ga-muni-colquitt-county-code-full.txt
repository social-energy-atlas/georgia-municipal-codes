PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of Colquitt County, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1981 Code, as supplemented through July 20, 1987, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1981 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Ronald K. McLaughlin, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to F. Marion Hay, County Administrator, William C. McCalley, County Attorney, and Deborah Cox, County Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

(c)  In the discretion of the judge and with his approval, the clerk of such small claims court shall be authorized to sign and issue process (and or notice) in all suits filed in said court and, also, to issue summonses of garnishment in appropriate cases; but such clerks may not issue criminal warrants. 
Sec. 5. - Fees. 
All fees collected by the judge as herein authorized, shall be retained by him as his sole remuneration. 
Sec. 6. - Commencement of actions; service of process, notice. 
(a)  Actions shall be commenced by the filing of a statement of claim, including the last known address of the defendant, in clear and concise form and free from technicalities. The plaintiff or his agent shall verify the statement of claim by oath or affirmation in the form herein provided, or its equivalent, and shall affix his signature thereto. The judge or clerk may, at the request of any individual, prepare the statement of claim and other papers required to be filed in an action. 
(b)  A copy of the verified statement, together with a notice of hearing in the form hereinafter prescribed, shall be served on the defendant, and such service shall be sufficient to give the court jurisdiction in the premises. Service of said notice shall be made only in the county by an officer or person authorized by law to serve process in superior courts; or by a duly qualified small claims court bailiff; or by registered or certified mail with a return receipt; or by any private individual not a party to or otherwise interested in the suit, especially appointed by the judge for that purpose. 
(c)  When notice is to be served by registered or certified mail, the clerk or the judge shall enclose a copy of the statement of claim, verification and notice in an envelope addressed to the defendant at his last known address, prepay the postage from monies collected for that purpose, and mail the same forthwith, noting on the record the date and hour of mailing. When a receipt therefor is returned, the clerk or judge shall attach the same to the original statement and notice of claim, or otherwise file it as a part of the record in the case, and it shall be prima facie evidence of service upon the defendant. 
(d)  When served by a private individual, as above provided, he shall make proof of service by affidavit, showing the time and place of such service on the defendant. 
(e)  When served as provided, the actual cost of service shall be taxable as costs. The cost of service shall be advanced by the party demanding same in addition to the filing fee hereinafter provided, and shall be taxed as other costs. 
(f)  The plaintiff shall be entitled to judgment by default, without further proof, upon failure of defendant to appear, when the claim of the plaintiff is for a liquidated amount; when the amount is unliquidated, plaintiff shall be required to present proof of his claim. 
(g)  Said notice shall specify the day and hour of the hearing, which shall not be less than five nor more than fifteen days from the date of the service of said notice; provided, however, that where service is made by registered or certified mail the date of mailing shall be the date of service. 
(h)  When service of process (or notice) in claim cases, or summons of garnishment in a garnishment action, is attempted by registered or certified mail as herein provided and a defendant or a garnishee refuses to accept delivery of same by or from a U.S. postal employee or U.S. mail carrier, and the envelope with process or summons is returned to the Court undelivered with notation by such postal employee or mail carrier that acceptance or delivery of same has been refused by the addressee, then the judge or the clerk of the court shall file and preserve such returned envelope, with process or summons contained therein, and it shall be prima facie evidence of service upon the defendant or upon the garnishee, as the case may be. 
Sec. 7. - Docket. 
(a)  A court docket shall be maintained in which shall be succinctly indicated every proceeding and ruling in each case; and a notation or memorandum of the fact, date and amount of a judgment may be indicated on the docket without formal entry thereof on original pleadings but, in case of an appeal, the judgment shall be otherwise written out, dated and signed by the judge. 
(b)  The court docket and pleadings shall be open to inspection by litigants in the case or their attorneys at all reasonable times so as not to interfere with the orderly business of the court but, pending final judgment and closing of a case, the judge may in his discretion withhold from nonlitigants any and all information regarding matters in process of litigation or settlement. 
Sec. 8. - Costs. 
The plaintiff, when he files his claim, shall deposit with the court the sum of $11.50 in claim cases against a single defendant, and $5.00 for each additional defendant in claims against two or more joint defendants, which shall cover the costs of that proceeding up to and including the rendering of a judgment, except the costs of serving process or notices to defendants and summonsing witnesses and hearing sworn testimony when required; but the deposit of costs as filing fees in cases of attachment, garnishment, trover, statutory foreclosures on personalty, and replevin by possessory warrant, and in actions ex delicto or in tort, shall be $13.50; and, in all contested actions ex delicto, the judge shall be entitled to additional compensation of $15.00 for each hour or fraction thereof required in hearing such cases; and in all other matters (not specifically mentioned herein) the costs shall be the same as provided for justices of the peace; and, in all claim cases and illegalities instituted by third persons after levy or after garnishment, the costs shall be $13.50, to be deposited by the party instituting such action and finally taxed in the discretion of the court. If a party shall fail to pay accrued costs, the judge shall have the power to deny said party the right to file any new case while such costs remain unpaid, and likewise to deny any litigant to proceed further in the case pending, and the judge shall also have the power to issue executions in favor of the officers of the court for any unpaid costs and have same enforced by levy and sale, by garnishment, or both. The final award of court costs, as between litigants, shall be according to the discretion of the judge and shall be taxed in the case at his discretion. 
Sec. 9. - Trial, pleading, procedure. 
(a)  On the day set for the hearing, or such later time as the judge may set, the trial shall be had. Immediately prior to the trial of any case, the judge shall make an earnest effort to settle the controversy by conciliation. If the judge fails to induce the parties to settle their differences without a trial, he shall proceed with the hearing on the merits. 
(b)  The judge shall conduct the trial in such manner as to do substantial justice between the parties according to the rules of substantive law, and all rules and regulations relating to pleading, practice and procedure shall be liberally construed so as to administer justice. 
(c)  In cases of attachment, garnishment, and trover, the legal grounds thereof shall be as now or hereafter provided by law, and the pleading and practice in such cases shall be substantially the same as obtained in courts of justices of the peace; and no formal declaration in attachment shall be required. 
(d)  If the plaintiff fails to appear, the case may be dismissed for want of prosecution, or defendant may proceed to a trial on the merits, or the case may be continued as the judge may direct. If both parties fail to appear, the judge may continue the case, or order the same dismissed for want of prosecution, or make any other just and proper disposition thereof, as justice may dictate. 
Sec. 10. - Counterclaims, third party claims. 
(a)  If any defendant has any claim against the plaintiff, the judge may require a statement of setoff to be filed, or same may be waived. If the plaintiff requires time to prepare his defense against such claim, the judge may in his discretion continue the case for such purpose. If any defendant has any claim against the plaintiff which exceeds the jurisdiction of the court, he may use a part thereof to offset the claim of the plaintiff. 
(b)  Whenever a claim affidavit and bond is filed by a third party claiming personal property that has been attached or levied upon under an attachment or execution issued from the small claims court, the levying officer shall forthwith return the same to said court and, unless the claimant (at the time he files his claim affidavit) makes written demand for a jury trial, the issues raised by such claim affidavit shall be heard and determined by the judge of said small claims court, and the judge shall be entitled to seven dollars and fifty cents ($7.50) for every such claim case. The same practice and procedure shall apply in cases of illegality affidavits. The plaintiff in attachment or plaintiff in execution may make written demand for a trial by jury within five days after a claim affidavit and bond is filed with the levying officer. The party demanding such jury trial shall deposit with the court a sum sufficient to defray the expenses of such trial, including the summoning of prospective jurors and jury fees, the amount to be determined by the judge. The costs in such cases, including the costs of a jury trial, shall be finally taxed against the party cast in said proceeding. 
Sec. 11. - Entry of judgment, executions. 
(a)  When a judgment is to be rendered and the party against whom it is to be rendered requests it, the judge shall inquire fully into the earnings and financial status of such party and shall have full discretionary power to stay the entry of judgment, and to stay execution, and to order partial payments in such amounts, over such periods, and upon such terms, as shall seem just under the circumstances and as will assure a definite and steady reduction of the judgment until it is finally and completely satisfied. 
(b)  The judge of such small claims court shall not be obligated to collect such deferred partial payments on judgments so rendered but, if the plaintiff so requests, he may do so at the expense of the plaintiff for clerical and accounting costs incurred thereby. 
Sec. 12. - Rules; bailiffs; terms; garnishment. 
(a)  The judge of the superior court of Colquitt County may from time to time make rules for a simple, inexpensive, and speedy procedure to effectuate the purposes of this Act [article] and shall have power to prescribe, modify and improve the forms to be used therein, from time to time, to ensure the proper administration of justice and to accomplish the purposes hereof. 
(b)  The judge of such court shall have power to appoint one or more bailiffs of and for said small claims court, to act within and throughout the limits of the county, such bailiffs to serve at the pleasure of the judge and under his direction, and a person so appointed shall be known and designated as "Small Claims Court Bailiff" and have the powers and authority, and be subject to the penalties, of all lawful constables of the State of Georgia, including the power to serve any and all processes and writs issued from or by said small claims court, with power, also to make levies and conduct judicial sales, and account therefor, in the manner of lawful constables. All such bailiffs shall, within five days from their appointment as such, take and subscribe the oath of office as prescribed in Section 24-804 and give the bond prescribed in Section 24-811 of the Code of Georgia, and such bailiffs shall be subject to be ruled for failure of duty or malfeasance in office as are other lawful constables of this State. 
(c)  Such small claims court having no designated terms at stated periods, but being always open for the transaction of business, the judge thereof shall, in each instance, set dates for hearings and trials in every kind of case and, also, designate the times when attachments and executions are returnable and, also, designate the time when each answer to a summons of garnishment shall be filed, but no garnishee may be required to file his answer sooner than ten days nor on a date later than ninety days after he is served with summons of garnishment, it being here intended that the maximum time limit for answering garnishments in the superior courts shall not apply to such small claims court. Whenever a garnishee shall fail to answer at the time so stated in the summons served upon him, unless the court in its discretion extends the time for filing, the judge may forthwith render judgment and issue an execution against the garnishee in favor of the plaintiff for the amount previously adjudged to be due the plaintiff by the original defendant, and also for costs in the garnishment proceeding, but no judgment shall be rendered against a garnishee before a final judgment shall have first been rendered against the defendant. In cases of garnishment of the wages of a defendant employee, and it appears to the judge that an undue hardship on the defendant would result from deducting from his wages the full amount authorized by law, the judge may, in his discretion, enter into an agreement with the garnishee employer for deducting from such wages a lesser amount than the law authorizes; and the judge may, in his discretion, enter into agreements with employers for extending the effectiveness of a garnishment beyond the time stated in the summons of garnishment and fixing the amounts, times and methods of making remittances, provided such agreements do not infringe upon the legal rights of other creditors. 
(d)  A summons of garnishment may be served by the sheriff or his deputies, or by a lawful constable, or by a small claims court bailiff; or it may be served by registered or certified mail, provided such service by mail is evidenced by a properly signed return receipt, which receipt shall be attached to the original garnishment affidavit, or to the writ of attachment. Whenever served in person by a court officer as aforesaid, such officer shall enter his return of service either on the back of the original garnishment affidavit or the attachment writ or on the back of a conformed copy of the original summons of garnishment which was given to the garnishee, or such entry of service may be made on a separate paper and attached to the said garnishment affidavit or the writ of attachment, as the case may be.

(b)  When the quotation or informal bids selection method is used by the purchasing agent or using agency head to seek firms to quote on the county commodities, services and construction products, local firms should be contacted, if possible, first.

(c)  In the event of a tie bid, when all other factors are equal, the purchasing agent shall select the bid from within the county, except that the purchasing agent and the county shall retain the flexibility to make the award of contract to a bidder outside of the county if there is sufficient evidence to support collusive bidding in favor of a local source. 
(d)  The local vendor preference policy shall only be applied when the lowest local qualified bidder is within five percent or $1,000.00, whichever is less, of the lowest non-local bidders.

(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV) 
Sec. 2-177. - Purchase requisition. 
(a)  The purchase requisition (PR) initiates the procurement cycle. The receipt of a PR with the necessary information and required signature gives the authority for each specific purchase.

(2)  To change or cancel an existing PR. 
(3)  To request price and delivery information on possible future requirements. 
(c)  The purchase requisition will be a single part form available from central supplies. The completed form is to be forwarded to the director of purchasing. The director will review the PR for the purpose of assuring that all required information is provided, that the price indicated is the "best price," that budget compliance/variance is known, and that contract compliance will be discussed directly with the requisitioner.

(d)  A purchase requisition shall include all of the following information: 
(1)  Date PR is prepared. 
(2)  Complete ship-to address.

(8)  If known, one or more suppliers should be recommended. If the requisitioner feels a particular supplier should not be used, it should be so stated along with the PR with a brief explanation. 
(9)  The quantity requested should clearly identify measurable units such as pieces, sheets, pounds, gallons, feet, etc. 
(10)  Descriptions should be complete and detailed. Specifications should be written so that no guess work is required. If a specification such as color is not important, it should be so stated on the PR. If known, the manufacturer and part number should be shown. 
(11)  List the unit price or an estimated unit price. 
(12)  The requisitioner should include on, or attached to, the PR, any useful information whatsoever that will assist in making the best possible buy on the needed supplies or services. 
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(1)) 
Sec. 2-178. - Vendor selection. 
Vendors will be selected on a competitive basis. Bids, quotations, and proposals will be solicited by newspaper advertising, direct mail, requests of prospective suppliers and by telephone, email, fax, website notice or other commonly utilized electronic media, as appropriate. Purchase orders or contracts will be awarded to the lowest and best responsible vendor. All bids may be rejected if it is in the public interest to do so. In determining "lowest and best responsive and responsible vendor," in addition to price, the following will be considered: 
(1)  The ability, capacity, and skill of the vendor to perform the contract or provide the material or service required. 
(2)  Whether the vendor can perform the contract or provide the material or service promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or interference. 
(3)  The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience, and efficiency of the vendor. 
(4)  The quality of performance of previous contracts, orders, or services. 
(5)  The previous and existing compliance by the vendor with laws and ordinances relating to the contract, order or service. 
(6)  The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the vendor to perform the contract, fill the order, or provide the service. 
(7)  The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplier, or contractual services to the particular use required.

(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(2); Res. No. 2016-R-10, 12-6-16) 
Sec. 2-179. - Requests for proposals and request for quotations. 
(a)  A request for proposal (RFP) is a formal solicitation that seeks to leverage the creativity and knowledge of business organizations to solve a unique problem or need. The RFP method does not use the cost of the project as the single determining factor, but, rather, uses a combination of cost plus best proposed solution to determine the award of the contract. The RFP will include a general description of the items to be purchased; the bid deposit and performance bond required, if any; where bid blanks and specifications may be secured; and, the time and place for opening bids. A request for quote (RFQ) includes well defined specifications and/or scope of work, and contains all contractual terms and conditions. The RFQ method solicits price quotations from prospective vendors and uses the lowest responsive and responsible bidder as a basis for award of a contract. Sealed bids will be opened in public at the time and place stated in the RFP or RFQ. A tabulation of bids can be obtained from the purchasing office after the opening. 
(b)  Purchases of less than $500.00 will be made in the open market without necessary resort to RFPs or RFQs, and may be solicited pursuant to section 2-178 by department heads and authorized by department heads. 
(c)  Purchases of $501.00 to $1,000.00 must have three bids, either written or verbal, which must be solicited pursuant to section 2-178 by the purchasing agent. However, in those instances where the purchasing agent cannot secure at least three bids within a time frame of five working days, then two or less bids shall be considered adequate. 
(d)  Purchases of $1,001.00 to $20,000.00 require three written bids which must be solicited pursuant to section 2-178 by the purchasing agent. However, in those instances where the purchasing agent does not receive at least three written bids within a time frame of five working days, then two or less shall be adequate. 
(e)  Purchases over $5,000.00 must be approved by the board of commissioners. 
(f)  Whenever any goods or services, other than automobiles, are available to the county through a contract with the federal or state government, and when such items or services meet the requirements of a using agency, such item or service shall be deemed to have met all the requirements of competitive bidding and may be purchased under the federal or state contract without regard to further government requirements. The purchasing agent shall be authorized to award contracts for the acquisition of goods and services from a state or federal contract when the cost associated with the good or service is within the prescribed budget authorized by the commission. No additional commission approval shall be required. All such contracts shall be reported to the commission on a monthly basis. 
(g)  Purchases over $20,000.00 require RFPs or RFQs solicited by the purchasing agent, and are subject to the following requirements: 
(1)  The RFP or RFQ must be posted for no less than 21 days immediately preceding the date for opening of sealed bids on the county website and published by advertising in the legal organ of the county. The public advertisement shall be inserted once a week for two weeks in the legal organ, the first insertion to be at least three weeks but not more than four week prior to the opening of the sealed bids, the second to follow one week after the publication of the first insertion. 
(2)  Such advertisement shall include but not be limited to the following: 
a.  A description sufficient to enable the public to know the approximate extent and character of the work to be done: 
b.  The time allowed for performance; 
c.  The terms and time of payment; 
d.  Where and under what conditions and costs the detailed plans and specifications and proposal forms may be obtained, which shall be available on the first day of publication or posting; 
e.  The amount of the proposal guaranty, if one is required: 
f.  The time and place for submission and opening of bids; 
g.  The right of the county to reject any one or all bids; and 
h.  Such further notice as the county may deem advisable as in the public interest. 
i.  A statement that all bids must be in writing and delivered to the purchasing agent in a sealed envelope. 
(3)  All bids shall be open publicly in the office of the county administrator, without discussion with any bidders; all such bids shall be publicly tallied; and shall be preserved pursuant to the Georgia Open Records Act. 
(4)  All such purchases generally require at least three written bids. However, in those instances where the purchasing agent does not receive at least three written bids, then two or less shall be adequate. 
(h)  The purchasing agent shall be authorized to enter into cooperative purchasing agreements with other units of government pursuant to the Interlocal Cooperation Act, O.C.G.A. § 36-69A-2, when, in his or her judgement, it would be in the best interest of the county. 
(Res. No. 2016-R-10, 12-6-16; Ord. No. 2018-1, 3-6-18) 
Editor's note— Res. No. 2016-R-10, adopted Dec. 6, 2016, repealed the former § 2-179 and enacted a new § 2-179 as set out herein. The former § 2-179 pertained to invitation for bids and request for quotations and derived from a motion of June 6, 1995, § IV(3); Ord. No. 96-8, adopted Oct. 1, 1996; and Ord. No. 99-1, adopted Mar. 15, 1999. 
Sec. 2-180. - Negotiation. 
The IFB method of formal advertising and to lesser extent the RFQ method, involves the inflexible process of sealed bids, public opening, and award to the lowest and best responsible bidder. Negotiation, on the other hand, usually involves, after receipt of quotations, the process of bargaining with suppliers or offerers proffering the best deal to the county. Notwithstanding county procurement by negotiation, like procurement by formal advertising requires the observation of impartiality toward all offerers. While negotiation procedures are more flexible than advertised procedures, such flexibility demands a greater degree of care to ensure that all competitive offerers are treated equally. Negotiation, as a purchasing technique, shall be used only after authorization by the board of county commissioners. 
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(4)) 
Sec. 2-181. - Purchase orders. 
(a)  This procedure will deal with formal purchase orders (POs). The purchase order is basically a legal contract. It represents a meeting of the minds between buyer and seller. All formal purchase orders will be prepared by the director of purchasing and executed and issued by the purchasing agent. No purchase order will be issued without a properly processed purchase requisition. 
(b)  All purchases, except purchases of less than $50.00 whether for single or multiple items, will require a purchase order. 
(c)  The purchase order will be a numbered, three-part form. After the purchase order is executed, it will be issued as follows: 
(1)  White copy. Mailed to the vendor. 
(2)  Yellow copy. Maintained in the purchasing department. 
(3)  Pink copy. Accounting department. 
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(5)) 
Sec. 2-182. - Purchase order log. 
The director of purchasing will maintain a PO log that will show the following information: 
(1)  PO number. 
(2)  Date the PO was issued. 
(3)  Department. 
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(6)) 
Sec. 2-183. - Charge account purchases. 
(a)  The purchasing agent will issue purchase orders to selected vendors establishing charge accounts. This method of buying is intended to expedite the procurement of frequently needed low dollar value supplies. Blanket purchase orders will have a $250.00 cumulative limit and no single purchase may be over $50.00. Department heads will forward to the purchasing agent a list containing the names and signatures of all personnel proposed to be authorized to sign for supplies under these agreements. Any changes to the name/signature list should be made in writing and filed with the purchasing agent. 
(b)  When charging supplies, the vendor's invoice must be signed by the authorized county employee receiving the material. Department heads will forward these signed invoices immediately to the director of purchasing. The director of purchasing must have all signed invoices in order to verify the accuracy of the vendor's monthly bills. Invoices signed by unauthorized personnel will not be paid. 
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(7)) 
Sec. 2-184. - Emergency purchases. 
Emergency purchases may be approved by the county administrator upon the request of the appropriate department head and recommendation of the purchasing agent. 
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(8)) 
Sec. 2-185. - Receipt and inspection. 
The ordering agency shall ultimately be responsible for the receipt, inspection, and acceptance of the incoming supplies and equipment. Receiving procedures are as follows: 
(1)  When any or all items on the PO have been received, inspected, and accepted, the delivery receipt shall be signed and forwarded to the director of purchasing. 
(2)  When received items are not acceptable, the receiving agency shall forward to the purchasing agent a receiving report with the reason for rejection stated thereon. The purchasing agent will then arrange for the return and replacement of the defective items, or take other action as required. In the case of defective supplies, the receiving report will also be used as a rejection report. 
(3)  When items that already have been accepted are subsequently found to be defective, the using agency shall notify the purchasing agent in writing. The following information, when known, is required: 
a.  Name of supplier. 
b.  PO number item was purchased on. 
c.  Date defective item was received. 
d.  Nature of defect. 
e.  Action requested (return for credit, for replacement, etc.). 
(4)  When items are to be received by or delivered to someone or someplace other than the using agency, the above procedures shall be modified only to the extent that: 
a.  Someone other than a using agency employee may sign the delivery receipt, but must notify the using agency of receipt of the order. 
b.  Someone should satisfy himself regarding the condition of the items, and check the items delivered against the machine copy of the purchase order. 
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(9)) 
Sec. 2-186. - Payments. 
Most vendors offer a cash discount if their invoices are paid promptly. To take advantage of this discount policy and maintain good vendor relations, it is important that all invoices, packing slips, and receiving reports be forwarded to the director of purchasing without delay. These documents should reach the director of purchasing within one working day after their receipt by using agencies. 
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(9)) 
Sec. 2-187. - Change orders. 
(a)  Using agencies wishing to change or cancel an existing purchase requisition or purchase order shall issue a purchase requisition requesting such change or cancellation. The changed PR will require the same signatures as required on the original PR. Always refer to the original PR number and clearly state the action requested. 
(b)  Upon receipt of a properly signed and processed change request PR, the purchasing agent will issue a change order or change the original PR, as required. When a change or cancellation is decided upon, the purchasing agent should be notified immediately. A few hours advance notice to the purchasing agent could save the county costly restocking or cancellation charges. 
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(10)) 
Sec. 2-188. - Vendors catalog file. 
The purchasing agent will maintain a vendor's catalog file. Catalogs in this file will be available to all interested county employees. 
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(11)) 
Sec. 2-189. - Sale of personal property. 
Only property declared surplus and obsolete to the needs of the county will be offered for sale. Only the purchasing agent is authorized to sell all supplies which have become unsuitable for public use, or to exchange the same for, or trade in the same on new supplies. Surplus supplies will be sold on a competitive basis to the highest bidder. 
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(12)) 
Sec. 2-190. - Maintenance contracts. 
The purchasing agent will maintain all records and information concerning county maintenance agreements. Before renewing any such agreement, the purchasing agent will check with the concerned department head to determine if the agreement should be renewed. Agreements found to be unnecessary will be terminated. Department heads will advise the purchasing agent of any change in the status of items covered by maintenance agreements. A copy of maintenance contracts will be on file also in the county clerk's office. 
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(13)) 
Sec. 2-191. - Service center. 
An inventory of gasoline, oil, and other supplies will be maintained at the purchasing department's service center. Parts, gasoline, and oil issued to the various departments will be charged to the departments at the end of each month. 
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(14)) 
Sec. 2-192. - Storeroom. 
(a)  The purchasing agent will establish and control a central storeroom for selected items such as office supplies, janitorial supplies, etc. This system will enable the purchasing agent to buy storeroom items in large quantities at a considerable cost savings as compared to buying such items as required. The storeroom method will also allow the county to standardize frequently used supplies. 
(b)  When a using agency needs any item that falls in the storeroom category, it will prepare a purchase requisition and present it to the purchasing agent for filling. If the requested item is not in stock, the purchasing agent will buy it, using the purchase requisition as authority to purchase. Requisitioned storeroom items will be charged to the appropriate departments at the end of each month. 
(Mo. of 6-6-95, § IV(15)) 
Sec. 2-193. - Suggestions. 
Suggestions that will help reduce cost, promote efficiency, or improve supplier services are both welcome and requested. Cost reduction ideas should reduce cost without a corresponding reduction in quality of service.

ARTICLE VI. - RECORDS MANAGEMENT[6] 

Footnotes: 
--- (6) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 2003-1, § 4, adopted Jan. 7, 2003, did not specifically amend the Code. Hence, its inclusion herein as article VI, sections 2-201—2-215, was at the discretion of the editor. 

Sec. 2-201. - Policy. 
The county board of commissioners recognizes that its citizens have a right to expect, and the county has an obligation to maintain, an efficient and cost-effective records management program and it further recognizes the importance of county records in the lives of its citizens. The county has a responsibility to its citizens to manage, protect, preserve and make available county records. 
It is the policy of the county board of commissioners to provide for efficient, economical, and effective controls over the creation, distribution, organization, maintenance, use, retention, and disposition of all records of the county. This policy will be implemented through a comprehensive system of integrated procedures for the management of records from their creation to their ultimate disposition, consistent with the requirements of the Georgia Open Records Act and accepted records management practice. 
The decision to adopt the county's records management program is a commitment to improving the county's overall record keeping system. The county acknowledges that, while the utilization of retention schedules and micro-graphics may in fact delay the inevitable chaos that results from records mismanagement or non-management, long-term benefits can be realized only through the introduction of a well-conceived, preplanned, comprehensive program that emphasizes the design, creation, use, maintenance and disposition of records.

A county record exempted from public disclosure under state or federal law is not made subject to disclosure by its designation as county property under this section. 
Except when a county record is transferred into the archival custody of records center, legal custody of a county record created or received by a department during the course of business remains with the director. The legal custodian, as guardian of the record, does not relinquish responsibility for the care, preservation, or legal disposition of the record even though physical custody of the record for maintenance and preservation purposes may be held by another department or agency. The physical custodian of the record is also responsible for complying with all records management program requirements, policies, and procedures. An original county record may not leave the custody of the department concerned when it is being used by a member of the public. 
Every official or employee shall deliver to any successor of county records pertaining to the office held by the county officer or employee. The legal and physical custody of a county record that has continuing historical value to the county may be transferred to records center upon agreement between the director and the records management coordinator. Records center's custody of the record subsequently will be known as archival custody, and ownership of the record remains with the county. The records center shall have legal and physical custody of all county records belonging to any defunct department that does not have a named successor.

ARTICLE III. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT 

Sec. 14-49. - Findings regarding necessity for adult entertainment article. 
(a)  Based on the experience of other local governmental jurisdictions recognizing that the sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages in adult entertainment establishments produces increased criminal activity and deterioration of adjacent neighborhoods, Colquitt County finds that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the county to enact regulations to reduce the possible adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. However, the county also finds that the outright prohibition of such establishments could improperly infringe upon protected forms of expression. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to reasonably regulate adult entertainment establishments in a manner that serves the legitimate governmental interest of reducing criminal activity and protecting property values without unreasonably infringing upon the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and their patrons. 
(b)  The county has again reviewed and considered problems that other counties have experienced as a result of adult entertainment establishments operating within those jurisdictions. The county, in reaffirming this article, has no intention to infringe upon the rights of any citizens to freedom of speech or expression. 
(c)  The United States Supreme Court, in Young v. American Mini Theaters, Inc., 427 U.S. 50 (1976), held that adult entertainment uses are subject to carefully tailored regulation to minimize the adverse land use impacts, and that zoning can legitimately be utilized to regulate such uses by establishing zones where adult entertainment uses are most compatible with other uses or the surrounding neighborhood, or by requiring minimum distances to be maintained between adult uses and other uses. 
(d)  The United States Supreme Court, in City of Renton v. Playtime Theater, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), held that a local government may rely on the experience of other jurisdictions in enacting legislation to regulate adult entertainment uses. 
(e)  The commissioners have considered and are mindful of the harmful secondary effects caused by adult entertainment uses as discussed in numerous judicial opinions, including but not limited to the following: 
(1)  Daytona Grand, Inc. vs. City of Daytona Beach, Florida, 490 F.3d 860 (11 th Circuit, 2007), 
(2)  5634 East Hillsborough Avenue, Inc. vs. Hillsborough County, Florida, Case no. 8:06-cv-1695-T-26EAJ, Middle District of Florida,

Sec. 26-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c). The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2); 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraphs (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this section and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in O.C.G.A. § 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
(d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c). 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 2016-2, § IV, 10-4-16) 
Sec. 26-35. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, the ordinance from which this article was derived, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the county without first obtaining a permit from the compliance office to perform such activity and providing a copy of the notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the compliance office and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c). Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
(3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 26-34(c)(15), (16), and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 26-35(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 26-34(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" is hereby incorporated by reference into this article.

Secs. 26-41—26-70. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - WETLAND PROTECTION 

Sec. 26-71. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  Findings of fact. The wetlands within the county are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and population control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. 
Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
The Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Georgia Department of Community Affairs have determined that each local government with classified wetlands located in its jurisdiction must adopt a wetlands protection ordinance under the requirements of House Bill 215, Georgia's 1989 Growth Strategies Legislation and the rules promulgated thereunder. 
It is therefore necessary for the county to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities in wetlands that may adversely affect wetlands. 
(b)  Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the wetland protection ordinance of Colquitt County, Georgia. The purposes of this article are to promote wise use of wetlands and protect wetlands, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational, and aesthetic values. Activities which may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined by a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature, and wildlife areas and to comply with the requirements of state law related to wetland protection. 
(Ord. No. 99-3, § 1, 6-22-99) 
Sec. 26-72. - Definitions 
Functions. The beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including: storage, conveyance, and attenuation of floodwater and storm water; protection of water quality and reduction of erosion; habitat for wildlife, including rare, threatened and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical, and archeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic, and recreational amenities. 
Generalized wetland map. A map depicting jurisdictional wetlands within the county. 
Hydric soils. Soils that form as a result of saturated soil conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the soil conservation service. 
Hydrophytic vegetation. Macrophytic plants tolerant of or dependent on saturated soil conditions. 
Jurisdictional wetland. A wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
Regulated activity. Any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States excepting those activities exempted in subsection 26-73(b) of this article and exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
Silviculture. The art of producing, reproducing and growing a forest of distinctive stands of trees. 
Temporary emergency permit. A temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified herein. 
Wetland. An area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophilic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. 
Wetland delineation. The establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or an authority designated by the Corps. 
Wetland protection district. All wetlands within the jurisdiction of the county which are indicated on the generalized wetland map as "wetlands providing significant wildlife habitat and/or which may be subject to extensive mitigation." 
(Ord. No. 99-3, § 2, 6-22-99) 
Sec. 26-73. - Wetland protection district established. 
(a)  Wetland protection district. This article shall apply to all wetlands within the wetland protection district as devised herein and located within the unincorporated region jurisdiction of the county. The generalized wetland map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands and of the wetland protection district and should be consulted by persons contemplating activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The generalized wetland map, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The generalized wetland map shall be on file in the office of the county administrator's office. 
(b)  Wetland protection district boundaries. The generalized wetland map is a general reference document and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U. S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not necessarily represent the exact boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the county, and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
(Ord. No. 99-3, § 3, 6-22-99) 
Sec. 26-74. - Local development permits. 
(a)  Local development permit requirements. No regulated activity will be allowed within the wetland protection district without written permission from the county administrator or his designee in the form of a local development permit. Issuance of a local development permit is contingent on full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. All activities that are not exempted in subsection (b) below or by other local development ordinances, shall be prohibited without prior issuance of a local development permit. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of the wetland protection district boundary, as determined from the generalized wetland map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present and that a section 404 permit or letter of permission is required, a local development permit will be issued only following issuance of the section 404 permit or letter of permission. 
(b)  Permissible uses (use as a right). The following uses shall be allowed as a right within the wetland protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, drainage, or dredging except as provided herein.

Secs. 26-80—26-90. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE IV. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE PROTECTION 

Sec. 26-91. - Short title, finding of fact and objectives. 
(a)  This article shall be known as the "groundwater protection ordinance." 
(b)  Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the county and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the county and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable, rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. 
Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
(c)  Objective. The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
(2)  Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and 
(3)  Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse affect on groundwater quality. 
(Ord. No. 99-4, § 1, 6-22-99) 
Sec. 26-92. - Establishment of a groundwater recharge area district. 
A groundwater recharge area district is hereby established which shall correspondence to all lands within the jurisdiction of unincorporated Colquitt County, that are mapped as significant recharge areas by the state department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. 
(Ord. No. 99-4, § 2, 6-22-99) 
Sec. 26-93. - Definitions. 
When used in this article, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning given in this section: 
(1)  Aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
(2)  Drastic means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600/2-87-035. (Note: The "drastic" methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility). 
(3)  Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharge, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. 
(4)  Pollution susceptibility maps means maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas having high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
(5)  Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
(6)  Significant recharge areas means those areas mapped by the department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology, soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contracts, geologic structure, the presence of karst, and potentiometric surfaces. Significant recharge areas for the county are typified by those of the coastal plain. In the coastal plain, the significant recharge areas are the surface outcroppings of the large and extensively used drinking water aquifers (e.g., the Floridan, the Clayton, etc.) and soils having high permeability according to the 1976 1:750,000 Soils Association Map of Georgia.

Section 261.3. (Note: This is the same definition as used in the Georgia Hazardous Waste Management Act.) 
Land-disturbing activity means any grading, scraping, excavating, or filling of land; clearing of vegetation; and any construction, rebuilding, or alteration of a structure. "Land-disturbing activity" shall not include activities such as ordinary maintenance and landscaping operations, repairs, additions or minor modifications to a single-family dwelling, and the cutting of firewood for personal use. 
Land uses existing prior to the promulgation of a river corridor protection plan means any land use or land-disturbing activity, including all human endeavors prior to the promulgation of the river corridor protection plan falls within one of the following categories: 
(1)  Is completed; 
(2)  Is under construction;

Although not within the measured 100-foot wide buffer, the area between the top of the bank and the edge of the river shall be treated by local governments in the same manner as the river corridor and shall be included within the river corridor protection plan. 
Because stream channels move due to natural processes such as meandering, river bank erosion, and jumping of channels, the river corridor may shift with time. For the purposes of these standards, the river corridor shall be considered to be fixed at its position at the beginning of each review period for local comprehensive plans. Any shift in the location of the protected river after the start of the review period will require a revision of the boundaries of the river corridor at the times of the next review by the department of community affairs.

ARTICLE VI. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 

Sec. 26-141. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives. 
(a)  Authorization . Article IX, Section II of the State Constitution and O.C.G.A. Section 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the county board of commissioners does ordain as follows: 
(b)  Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(c)  Statement of purpose . It is the purpose of the ordinance from which this article was derived to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters. 
(d)  Objectives . The objectives of the ordinance from which this article was derived are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, roads and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(4)  To minimize expenditures of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
(7)  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 2000-1, Art. 1, 5-2-00; Ord. No. 2009-1, Art. 1, 2-16-09) 
Sec. 26-142. - General provisions. 
(a)  Lands to which the ordinance from which this article was derived applies . The ordinance from which this article was derived shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the county. 
(b)  Basis for area of special flood hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its flood insurance study (FIS), dated July 16, 1997, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of the ordinance from which this article was derived. 
For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS dated July 16, 1997, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revisions thereto, for the county, are hereby adopted by reference thereto. 
Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in an FIS. 
The repository for public inspection of the flood insurance study (FIS), accompanying maps and other supporting data is located in the Colquitt County Compliance/Zoning Office, Room 168, Colquitt County Courthouse Annex, 101 East Central Avenue, Moultrie, Georgia 31768. 
(c)  Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of the ordinance from which this article was derived prior to the commencement of any development activities. 
(d)  Compliance . No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of the ordinance from which this article was derived and other applicable regulations. 
(e)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. The ordinance from which this article was derived is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing ordinances, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where the ordinance from which this article was derived and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(f)  Interpretation . In the interpretation and application of the ordinance from which this article was derived, all provisions shall be: (1) considered as minimum requirements; (2) liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and (3) deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(g)  Warning and disclaimer of liability . The degree of flood protection required by the ordinance from which this article was derived is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. The ordinance from which this article was derived does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. The ordinance from which this article was derived shall not create liability on the part of the county or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on the ordinance from which this article was derived or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(h)  Penalties for violation. Failure to comply with the provisions of the ordinance from which this article was derived or with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a violation. Any person who violates the ordinance from which this article was derived or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $1,000.00 or imprisoned for not more than 60 days, or both, and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case.

(6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
(7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
(8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
(9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
(10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of the ordinance from which this article was derived, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
(b)  Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 26-144(a)(4), "Elevated buildings." 
a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
(2)  Non-residential construction . New construction or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 26-143(c)(6). 
(3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles . Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either:

2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. section 26-144(a)(6).) 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of section 26-144(b)(3)(a) and (c). 
(4)  Floodway . Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 26-142(b), are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
b.  Only if section 26-144(b)(4)(a) is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section. 
(c)  Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones) . Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 26-142(b), where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 26-142(b), then the compliance officer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this section. Only if data is not available from these sources, then the following subsections (c)(2) and (c)(3) shall apply. 
(2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-Zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed.) Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 26-144(a)(4), "Elevated buildings." 
a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
The compliance officer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(d)  Standards for areas of special flood hazard (Zones AE) with established base flood elevations without designated floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 26-142(b), where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated (Zones AE), the following provisions apply: 
(1)  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
(2)  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with section 26-144(b). 
(e)  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO Zones). Areas of special flood hazard established in section 26-142(b) may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 26-144(a)(4), "Elevated buildings." 
The compliance officer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in section 26-143. 
(3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
(f)  Standards for subdivisions. 
(1)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
(2)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All subdivision and/or development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards; and 
(4)  For subdivisions and/or developments greater than 50 lots or five acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-built" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR. 
(g)  Standards for critical facilities. 
(1)  Critical facilities shall not be located in the 100-year floodplain or the 500-year floodplain. 
(2)  All ingress and egress from any critical facility must be protected to the 500-year flood elevation. 
(Ord. No. 2000-1, Art. 4, 5-2-00; Ord. No. 2009-1, Art. 4, 2-16-09) 
Sec. 26-145. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The county board of commissioners shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of the ordinance from which this article was derived. 
(b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the compliance officer in the enforcement or administration of the ordinance from which this article was derived. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of commissioners may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county, as provided in O.C.G.A. Section 5-4-1. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of the ordinance from which this article was derived. 
(h)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of the ordinance from which this article was derived are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The compliance officer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of the ordinance from which this article was derived, the board of commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of the ordinance from which this article was derived.

Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced after June 17, 1991 [the effective date of the initial FIRM] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, new construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced after May 2, 2000 [the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the county] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after May 2, 2000. 
North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA flood modernization maps. 
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alternation of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the roads, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of the ordinance from which this article was derived which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by the ordinance from which this article was derived.

g.  Signature of owner or agent applying for permit. 
(2)  However, part of the information required for the application may be waived, provided the county board of health deems that information is available from previously submitted subdivision or mobile home park data, or from other sources, sufficient to make an adequate appraisal of the acceptability of the proposed lot for on-site sewage management system installation. 
(c)  Requirements for on-site sewage management system construction permit issuance or denial. 
(1)  On-site sewage management system construction permits for conventional septic tank systems shall be issued only after a site inspection by the county board of health shows favorable findings relative to percolation rates, soil characteristics, groundwater, rock, and any other factors which would affect the acceptability of the lot. For construction of conventional septic tank systems, the suitability of the lot must be demonstrated through acceptable soil characteristics and/or percolation rates of less than 90 minutes per inch; freedom from groundwater interference or other potential for contamination of groundwater by sewage; absence of impervious strata below the level of the absorption field and absence of undesirable topographic characteristics and other factors which singly, or in combination, affect the acceptability of the lot. Lot suitability and approval for other types of on-site sewage management systems is to be determined by criteria established by the department's manual. The county board of health may deny or revoke an on-site sewage management system construction permit upon finding the lot unsuitable or for failure of the applicant to comply with the provisions of these rules. Such denial shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the Georgia Health Code. On-site sewage management construction permits shall remain valid for not more than 12 months from the date of issue. 
(2)  Issuance of a construction permit for an on-site management system, and subsequent approval of same by representatives of the county board of health shall not be construed as a guarantee that such systems will function satisfactorily for a given period of time; furthermore, such representatives do not, by any action taken in effecting compliance with these rules, assume any liability for damages which are caused, or which may be caused, by the malfunction of such system. 
(d)  Inspections. No person may cover or use a new on-site sewage management system until final inspection has been made by the county board of health to determine compliance with the provisions of the construction permit issued under subsection (c) of this section, and written approval has been issued by the county board of health. 
(1)  A copy of the final inspection of an on-site sewage management system shall be provided to the owner, builder, developer or agent, whichever is appropriate. 
(2)  Any grading, filling, or other landscaping or construction activities on the lot subsequent to final inspection by the county board of health which may adversely affect the on-site sewage management system shall render the approval void. 
(e)  Maintenance. 
(1)  It is the property owner's responsibility to maintain and operate the on-site sewage management system in a safe and sanitary manner so as not to constitute a public health hazard or nuisance. 
(2)  Where an on-site sewage management system is proposed to serve facilities under separate ownership, a contract to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the system, signed by all owners, shall exist as a precondition to the issuance of a permit for the construction of the on-site sewage management system. 
(f)  Prohibited discharge. No person shall allow the unapproved discharge or spillage of sewage, nor shall an on-site sewage management system be used or maintained in such a manner that will allow the seepage or discharge of effluent from such system to the ground surface, to a watercourse, drainage ditch, open trench, canal, storm drain or storm sewer, water well, abandoned well, lake, stream, river, estuary, groundwater or other body of water. 
(g)  Design limits on conventional septic tank systems. To provide for the maintenance of sanitary conditions through the proper functioning of a conventional septic tank system for a reasonable period of time, no such system may be installed, constructed, or used, having a septic tank design capacity of less than 750 gallons or more than 10,000 gallons, or where the total length of absorption trenches required would exceed 3,000 linear feet, or where the total absorption trench bottom area required would exceed 9,000 square feet. 
(h)  Submission of plans, specifications, and soil data. Plans, specifications, soil data and, if required, percolation test data, submitted to the county board of health for the purpose of obtaining a construction permit to install an on-site sewage management system to serve a commercial, industrial or institutional facility, which will produce a sewage flow in excess of 2,000 gallons per day, a travel trailer and/or mobile home park, or multiple family dwelling of five or more family units shall bear the registration number and signature of a registered professional engineer, certified and registered under the laws of this state. The county board of health may accept plans, specifications, soil data, and percolation test data for commercial, industrial, or institutional facilities with sewage flows of 2,000 gallons or less per day and for single- and multiple-family dwellings having not more than four-family units, when prepared in accordance with these rules, from any person who demonstrates to the satisfaction of the county board of health that they have sufficient knowledge of on-site sewage management system design, soil evaluation, and of conducting percolation tests. 
(i)  Soil data acceptability. Soil data deemed to be acceptable by the county board of health shall include information on soil characteristics obtained from published soil surveys and/or unpublished reports and field data developed by the Soil Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture, or from special investigations conducted by a soil scientist.

Such sewers shall be laid on a firm foundation, and shall not be subject to settling, and shall be installed on a grade that will ensure a self-cleaning velocity. Where on-site sewage management systems are used, and where installation of building drains and building sewers is not covered by duly adopted local plumbing codes, or in the absence of a local plumbing code and/or plumbing inspections, the county board of health shall verify the adequacy and acceptability of all of any portion of the building sewer or the building drain. 
(Co. Bd. Health Rule 290-5-26.04) 
Sec. 70-50. - Septic tanks. 
(a)  Minimum design and construction. Septic tanks shall be designed and constructed to equal or exceed minimum design and construction criteria established by the department as published in the current manual for on-site sewage management systems. Any person seeking approval of septic tanks to be used in on-site sewage management systems after the effective date of these rules, shall submit detailed plans and specifications for tank manufacture and such other information as may be required by the county board of health. Manufacturers and suppliers shall be subject to periodic inspection, and approved by the county board of health. 
(b)  Location. No septic tank shall be installed less than 50 feet from existing or proposed wells/springs, or suction water lines, and tanks shall be located downgrade from wells or springs, if physically possible; less than 25 feet from lakes, ponds, streams, watercourses, or sinkholes; less than ten feet from pressure water supply lines, or less than ten feet from a property line. No septic tank shall be installed less than 15 feet from a drainage ditch or embankment. Septic tanks shall be installed so as to provide ready access for necessary maintenance. Normally the desired distance a septic tank should be located from a building foundation is at least ten feet but if conditions permit, lesser distances may be allowed by the county board of health. The county board of health, after site inspection, may require greater separation distances than cited herein due to unusual conditions of topography, or other site configuration, subsurface soil characteristics and/or groundwater interference. 
(c)  Capacity. The liquid capacity of septic tanks for single family dwellings shall be not less than 750 gallons for one or two bedrooms; 900 gallons for three bedrooms; 1,000 gallons for four bedrooms and 250 additional gallons for each bedroom over four. The liquid capacity of septic tanks in on-site sewage management systems for non-residential usage shall be based on the anticipated daily sewage flow from the facility served, but in no case shall be less than 750 gallons. Septic tank capacity shall be increased by 50 percent where garbage grinders are to be used. 
(d)  Compartmented tanks. Compartmented tanks are permissible upon approval by the county board of health. 
(e)  Tanks in series. The county board of health may approve the installation of two septic tanks placed in series provided that the capacity of the first tank is at least 750 gallons and at least equal to the capacity of the second tank. When tanks in series are used, they shall be connected with a sealed sewer line, and all sewage shall initially enter the first tank. 
(f)  Foundation and backfill. Septic tanks shall be constructed or installed level, on a foundation that will prevent settling; backfill shall be placed so that a stable fill results and undue strain on the tank is avoided. Earth backfill shall be free of voids, large stones, stumps, broken masonry, or other such materials. A minimum earth cover of six inches over the tank is recommended. All openings and manholes shall be constructed so as to prevent the entrance of surface water. 
(Co. Bd. Health Rule 290-5-26.05) 
Sec. 70-51. - Distribution boxes and dosing tanks; minimum design and construction. 
(a)  Distribution boxes. Distribution boxes shall be designed and constructed in accordance with minimum design and construction criteria established in the department's current manual and section 70-52(d)(1). Approval procedures shall follow the requirements as set forth under section 70-50(a). 
(b)  Dosing tanks. Where required, dosing tanks shall be designed, constructed, and installed in accordance with the department's current manual. 
(Co. Bd. Health Rule 290-5-26.06) 
Sec. 70-52. - Absorption fields. 
(a)  Area computation. Absorption trench bottom area shall be based upon the anticipated volume of treated sewage and upon the characteristics of the soil in which absorption fields are to be located as specified in the current on-site sewage management system manual. Soil characteristics and other related data, including percolation tests, may be required by the county board of health. 
(b)  Location. No absorption field shall be constructed less than 100 feet from existing or proposed wells or springs; less than ten feet from water supply lines; less than ten feet from building foundations and property lines; less than 15 feet from an embankment nor less than 50 feet from the normal water level of any impoundment, tributary, stream, or other body of water. If it becomes necessary for the absorption field to be crossed by a water supply line, the water supply line within ten feet of the absorption field shall be at least 12 inches above the top of the aggregate layer of the absorption line and shall be encased in a single length of water pipe. No absorption field shall be installed in areas where groundwater, soil characteristics or adverse geological formation may interfere with the absorption of sewage effluent. 
(c)  Minimum design and construction for conventional septic tank systems. Absorption lines and absorption trench bottoms shall be true to grade and trenches shall be not less than 25 inches in depth, and shall have not less than 12 inches of earth cover. Maximum length of absorption trench laterals for distribution box systems shall be 100 feet; laterals shall be equal in length and spaced not less than eight feet apart, center to center. Absorption trenches shall be not more than 36 inches wide. 
(d)  Field layout methods for conventional septic tank systems. Absorption fields shall be planned and installed in accordance with one of the following methods: 
(1)  Distribution box method. On level or sloping topography, the distribution box method may be used, and shall be required when dosing tanks are used. A firm earthen or concrete foundation for distribution boxes extending at least 12 inches beyond the walls of the box shall be provided to ensure against tilting of the distribution box. Extreme care should be exercised in backfilling around and over the distribution box. The top of the distribution box shall have a minimum earth cover of six inches but no more than 24 inches unless provisions are made for ready access to the distribution box. The sewer from the septic tank or dosing tank shall enter the distribution box and terminate inside the distribution box with an elbow turned downward to form a submerged outlet at normal water level, or a baffle may be used, providing the same function is accomplished. Absorption lines of equal lengths shall be connected to distribution box outlets by independent sewers. Absorption trenches may be installed at the same elevation or at different elevations, but all sewers leading from the distribution box outlet to the absorption lines shall be installed at the same elevation and shall be level for two feet and shall be sealed watertight. Beginning two feet from the distribution box, the grade of such sealed lines shall be not less than one-eighth inch per foot. Absorption lines shall be laid on a uniform grade of not less than two inches nor more than four inches per 100 feet with the minimum of two inches recommended. An increased number of shorter trenches is recommended rather than the use of fewer, longer trenches. 
(2)  Level field method. On level or slightly sloping topography, the level field method may be used. When this method is used, the absorption field shall be installed level, with all absorption lines interconnected to form a continuous system. A standard tee fitting shall be used to interconnect the absorption lines. 
(3)  Serial distribution method. On more severely sloping topography, the serial distribution method may be used. When this method is used, level absorption trenches shall be constructed along land contours. The sewer from the septic tank shall enter the uppermost absorption lines and terminate at any point in the line so that all sewage from the septic tank is discharged into the first line. Adjacent absorption lines shall be successively connected by means of overflow sewers constructed at any point along the line in such a manner that each trench is filled with effluent to the full depth of aggregate before the effluent flows through the overflow sewer to the next trench. The invert of the first overflow sewer must be at least four inches lower than the invert of the septic tank outlet. At the point where an overflow sewer leaves an absorption trench, the excavation for the overflow sewer shall be dug no deeper than the top of the aggregate in the absorption trench, so that an undisturbed block of earth will remain in place for the full depth of the aggregate. Overflow sewers connecting absorption trenches shall be laid on undisturbed earth. 
(Co. Bd. Health Rule 290-5-26.07) 
Sec. 70-53. - Privies. 
Privies shall be designed and constructed in accordance with minimum design and construction criteria established by the current on-site sewage management system manual. 
(Co. Bd. Health Rule 290-5-26.08) 
Sec. 70-54. - Alternative and experimental on-site sewage management systems and site modifications. 
(a)  The department recognizes that on-site sewage management systems employing solids retention and on-site soil absorption of sewage effluent, if designed properly and installed in suitable soil, are usually ecologically safe and do adequately protect the public health. 
(b)  The department further recognizes that substantial portions of the state's undeveloped land area are marginally suitable or totally unsuitable for conventional septic tank systems, and that continued installation of such systems will have a detrimental effect on the public health. Where appropriate, and after thorough assessment of alternatives, the county board of health will consider alternative on-site sewage management systems and/or modifications for areas with soils which may have only marginal suitability in their present condition, including community-managed on-site sewage management systems and combinations of public or community sewage treatment systems and on-site sewage management systems. 
(c)  When considering proposals for alternative on-site sewage management systems, priority shall be given to those situations where the alternative system will resolve an existing sewage management problem. Any person or community desiring to install an alternative on-site sewage management system shall submit the following information to the county board of health: 
(1)  Plans and specifications, along with any engineering, laboratory, or field data required. 
(2)  Information as required on the application for an individual on-site sewage management system construction permit, and any additional information as may be required by the county board of health. If the proposal for the system is approved, the person making application will be informed by the county board of health of any requirements for maintenance, and any monitoring procedures deemed necessary by the county board of health. Reduction of water usage by the installation of water conserving fixtures and devices should be considered in overall strategy. 
(d)  The department may consider proposals for the use of experimental on-site sewage management systems. Acceptance or denial of such proposals shall depend on many site and system specific-factors, including a primary consideration that the remainder of the site is suitable for a conventional septic tank system in the event of failure of the experimental system. 
(e)  Approval of certain lots determined to be unsuitable for conventional septic tank systems may be reconsidered if appropriate site modifications are carried out to eliminate or significantly ameliorate unfavorable site characteristics. Modifications may include surface or subsurface drainage systems, filling, grading, etc. Any person desiring to modify a lot for the purpose of obtaining a construction permit for installation of an on-site sewage management system shall submit for approval detailed plans showing the type and extent of modifications. The county board of health may require any additional information or clarification needed for formulating a proper decision on the proposed modifications. No modifications shall be carried out prior to the approval and issuance of a construction permit. 
(Co. Bd. Health Rule 290-5-26.09) 
Sec. 70-55. - Percolation tests and test borings. 
(a)  Percolation tests. If conducted, percolation tests shall not be considered presumptive or conclusive evidence as to the suitability of a given lot for the use of on-site sewage management systems. Such tests shall be considered and analyzed as one of many criteria in determining soil suitability. Acceptable data on soil characteristics, including the location of rock strata and water table evaluations, will be considered of primary importance. Percolation tests, if conducted, will be used to augment or supplement the soils data. It should be further understood that percolation tests conducted during dry weather periods in areas that commonly experience high seasonal water table elevations during wet periods of the year will often exhibit very good percolation rates, thus inaccurately portraying the absorptive capacity of the soil during wet periods. Percolation tests shall be run in accordance with the modified Taft Engineering Center method published in the department's current manual for on-site sewage management systems. 
(b)  Location and number. 
(1)  Percolation test holes should be located in the area proposed for the installation of the absorption field. Data from test holes in areas outside of, or clearly uncharacteristic of, the proposed installation site will not be allowed. Percolation tests shall not be conducted in holes created by the deterioration of stumps and roots, or any other area which would render results that inaccurately portray the absorptive capacity of the soil in the absorption field area. 
(2)  The number of tests shall be sufficient to obtain a proper appraisal of the absorptive capacity of the soil in the proposed absorption field area and shall be determined by the county board of health. The number of tests required for preliminary appraisal of subdivisions may be specified in lesser numbers, provided a general overview of the soil characteristics of the total subdivision acreage is provided. Percolation test holes shall be located by number on a topographic map showing lot designation, boundaries, easements, etc., and the results shall be recorded on the map. 
(c)  Test borings for rock, shale, hardpan. Where surface outcropping or subsurface formations raise reasonable doubt concerning the operational effectiveness of on-site sewage management systems, a sufficient number of test borings to an appropriate depth may be required by the county board of health to determine whether on-site sewage management systems can be expected to give satisfactory service. Such borings and the results shall be located by number and recorded on the topographic map. 
(d)  Individuals conducting tests. Individuals conducting percolation tests and/or test borings shall notify the county board of health at least 24 hours prior to performing these procedures and, at the option of the county board of health, such procedures shall be performed in the presence of a county board of health representative. 
(Co. Bd. Health Rule 290-5-26.10)

The application shall include but not be limited to: the business name and address, name and address of the applicant, the manner by which such contents are to be removed, transported, and given final disposal and such other documentation as may be required by the county board of health, including evidence that septage removed and transported will be accepted at approved disposal sites. If surface spreading, subsurface land disposal or other method of treatment or disposal is to be used, additional information may be required. 
(b)  Disposal methods. Approved methods of disposal of septage from on-site sewage management systems shall be discharged to a public or community sewage treatment system for treatment in a wastewater treatment plant, treatment at separate septage handling facilities, or direct land application. Disposal by any of these methods shall require written permission from both the appropriate governing official, private septage handling facility owner or land owner and a representative of the county board of health. 
(c)  Vehicle identification. The name and address of the person or firm engaging in the removal of septage from on-site sewage management systems and the permit number shall be lettered on both sides of each vehicle used for septage removal purposes. Letters and numerals shall not be less than two inches in height and shall be readily visible. 
(d)  Vehicle maintenance. Every vehicle used for removal of septage from on-site sewage management systems shall be equipped with a watertight tank or body and properly maintained. Liquid wastes shall not be transported in open bodied vehicles. All pumps, hose lines, valves and fittings shall be maintained so as to prevent leakage.

Section 4.30. - Protective screening. 
In order to provide adequate protective screening for residential areas adjacent to or near non-residential areas, the following regulations shall apply: 
a.  Adjacent residential property. Where a C-1, C-2, C-3, C-PUD, M-1 or M-2 district abuts directly upon a residentially zoned district, a landscaped greenbelt, not less than 20 feet wide, shall be provided and maintained along its entire length by the users of the C-1, C-2, C-3, C-PUD, M-1 or M-2 property. In addition, the C-1, C-2, C-3, C-PUD, M-1 or M-2 district shall be screened from such contiguous residentially zoned district by either a building housing a permitted use or else by an ornamental masonry wall or chain link fence five feet in height above grade, between said greenbelt areas and the commercial or industrial use in said C-1, C-2, C-3, C-PUD, M-1 or M-2 district. Such greenbelt shall be planted with deciduous trees, evergreens, flowering trees and/or ornamental trees set not closer than six feet to the fence or wall. 
The remainder of the landscaped area which is not planted with the aforementioned stock shall be in well-kept lawn. All landscaping shall be maintained in a healthy growing condition, neat and orderly in appearance. 
All planting plans shall first be submitted to the planning commission/county commission for approval as to suitability of planting materials and arrangement thereof in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance. 
Where vehicles or open air display generally exceed a five-foot height, said wall or chain link fence shall be increased to a height not exceeding ten feet, providing further that all such walls shall be of uniform height around the premises and the design of such wall is first approved by the planning commission/county commission. 
If, in the opinion, of the planning commission/county commission, the greenbelt would serve no good purpose, the commission may waive such requirements, and provide only the wall or fence between the residential and C-1, C-2, C-3, C-PUD, M-1 or M-2 district, provided it abuts a nonconforming use in a residential area. 
b.  Residential property across alley. Any C-1, C-2, C-3, C-PUD, M-1 or M-2 district on which a drive-in business, open air display, commercial parking lot or other open use is conducted shall be separated along its entire length from any adjacent residentially zoned district, located across a public alley of not less than 20 feet wide, by either a building housing permitted use or by an ornamental masonry wall five feet in height above grade located, preferably, on the residential side of said public alley. Greater wall height may be required in accordance with paragraph "a" above. 
c.  Waiver of wall or fence requirement. Where required walls or fences are provided on the business side of public alleys, wall or fence requirements may be waived to provide necessary entrance to or exit from required off-street/road parking and loading areas, provided approval is secured from the planning commission and county commission as to suitability of width and location of such openings in said wall or fence. 
d.  Setbacks from agricultural zones. The main dwelling must be a minimum of 125 feet from the property line adjacent to property zoned agricultural (AG). 
When a non-agricultural use is proposed for property abutting an agricultural (AG) district, or will be located within the required minimum setbacks for this district, the developer or property owner shall be provided with a "notice of agricultural adjacency" at the time an application for building permit or change in zoning classification or use is filed. As a condition of and prior to any administrative action on either the change in zoning classification or use request, or the issuance of any land use, building, or occupancy permit, the applicant shall be required to sign on a waiver on a form prepared by the zoning official(s) which will indicate that the applicant understands that there is an ongoing agricultural land use adjacent to the subject property which could produce odors, noise, dust, and other effects which may not be compatible with the applicant's development. Nevertheless, understanding the effects of agricultural operations and uses on adjacent land, the applicant agrees, by executing the form, to waive any objection to those effects and understands that this change in zoning classification or use and/or permits are issued and processed in reliance on his agreement not to bring any action against adjacent landowners, whose property is agricultural and an agricultural operation, or any local government, asserting that the adjacent agricultural operations or uses of agricultural land constitutes a nuisance; provided that said existing agricultural use is operated in conformance with this ordinance and with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations.

ARTICLE X. - R-PUD, RESIDENTIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 

Section 10.01. - Residential planned unit development district. 
It is the intention of this ordinance to provide areas of sufficient size and allowing reasonable flexibility in design and orientation for the establishment of a structure or group of structures which include multiple dwellings designed in a planned unit development of more than one building on a given site. The requirements of the area, height, bulk, and placement regulations, as they are usually applicable to individual buildings and individual lots of record, would in certain cases of large scale development have results affording less protection to the public health, safety and welfare than if a measure of flexibility were permitted. The permitting of these planned unit developments as special and particular land use can, in certain cases, increase the desirability and convenience to the residents or occupants of the planned unit development without causing adverse effects on adjoining properties. 
Therefore, the zoning ordinance regulations relative to area, height, bulk and placement may, in the residential planned unit development district, be modified by the planning commission and county commission in the case of a plan for a large scale development which, in the judgment of the planning commission and county commission, provides adequate open space and improvements for circulation, recreation, education, light air and service needs of the tract when fully developed, provided that in no case may the density of the proposed planned unit development exceed 13 dwelling units per acre and provided further that the minimum site size for the residential planned unit development is three acres. 
Within the residential planned unit development district the following regulations shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 2006-5, § 1, 10-24-06)

b.  Community garages serving the principal residential building, containing space for no more than two passenger vehicles for each dwelling unit in the principal building on the lot. 
c.  Maintenance and management buildings to serve the multiple dwellings. 
d.  Private swimming pools designed and operated only for occupants of the principal multiple dwellings and their personal guests. 
e.  Signs when located on the same lot pertaining to the use of the particular building or buildings, provided that they shall not overhang any public right-of-way; shall not be illuminated; shall not exceed 12 square feet in area; shall not project higher than one story or 20 feet above the level of the ground whichever is lower; and shall not indicate any information except the name or address of the building or management thereof. 
f.  Community buildings in the nature of clubhouses, libraries, reading rooms, community facilities such as laundry rooms and washrooms and entertainment centers provided that all of the uses listed in this ordinance are designed and operated only for occupants of the multiple dwellings which are the principal buildings and their personal guests.

3.  Inspection. The county compliance office shall have the right to inspect any solar farm without notice if there is a risk of immediate harm or injury to person or property. If there is no risk of immediate harm or injury to person or property, the county compliance office shall have the right to inspect any solar farm upon making reasonable efforts to notify the owners or operators 24 hours in advance of the inspection. 
4.  Penalties. 
a.  Each violation of this article may be punished as provided in section 1-11 of this Code and Title 15, Chapter 10, Article 4 of the Official Code of Georgia, O.C.G.A 15-10-60, et seq.

Section 22.04. - Variances. 
In hearing and acting upon applications, the governing body may also grant, in specific cases, such variance from the terms of this ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the governing body that: 
1.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question and because of its size, shape, or topography; and, 
2.  The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; and,

Section 22.06. - Standards governing exercise of zoning power. 
In any zoning decision, the governing body shall always balance the interest in promoting the public health, safety, morality, or general welfare of the citizens of the county against the right to the unrestricted use of property. Specifically, the governing body shall use and apply the following standards governing any exercise of zoning power, which said standards are deemed to be relevant factors in the balancing process: 
a.  Existing uses and zoning of nearby property; 
b.  The extent to which property values are diminished by the particular zoning restrictions; 
c.  The extent to which the destruction of property values, resulting from the existing or proposed zoning of parcels, promotes the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public; 
d.  The relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship imposed upon the individual property owner, by the proposed zoning classification; 
e.  The suitability of the subject classification;
