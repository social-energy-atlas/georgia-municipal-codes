         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Aragon, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 2003 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council through January 19, 2017. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 2003 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This republication was under the direct supervision of Paula Freeman, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
                  The publisher is most grateful to Zachary Burkhalter, City Attorney, and Christie Langston, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

                  (b)  At the appropriate time of the meeting, the chairman shall read all of the items on the consent agenda. If a councilmember objects to an item being on the consent agenda, the chairman shall move that particular item to the regular agenda. Following the reading of the consent agenda, the chairman will ask for unanimous approval of the items on the consent agenda. If there are no objections, all the items on the consent agenda will be adopted by unanimous consent.

                  (a)  The city clerk shall promptly record the minutes for each council meeting. The minutes serve as the official written record of the council meeting and shall be open for public inspection once approved as official by the council, but in no case later than immediately following the next regular meeting of the council. The minutes shall specify the names of councilmembers present at the meeting, a description of each motion or other proposal made at the meeting, the councilmember who proposed each motion, the councilmember who seconded each motion, and a record of all votes. In the case of a roll-call vote, the name of each councilmember voting for or against a proposal shall be recorded. It shall be presumed that a councilmember has voted in the affirmative, unless the minutes show otherwise. More detailed information may be included in the minutes at the request of the council. 
                  (b)  The council must approve the minutes before they can be considered as an official record of the council. A copy of the minutes from the previous meeting shall be distributed to the councilmembers at least one business day before the following meeting. The minutes of the previous meeting shall be corrected and approved by the council at the beginning of each meeting. A majority vote is required for approval. Conflicts about the content of the minutes shall be decided by majority vote. Upon being approved, the minutes shall be signed by the chairman and attested to by the city clerk. 
                  Sec. 2-46. - Order of business.

                  Public participation in meetings of the city council shall be permitted in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
                  (1)  Comments. The first item on the agenda is to allow comments from the public. All members who wish to address the council are urged to submit their name and the topic of their comments to the city clerk at least three days prior to the council meeting. Each individual will be allowed five minutes to make his comments. If several people are present to discuss the same topic, the group is requested to have one or two members present their comments on behalf of the group. These limits may be waived by the mayor and council. 
                  (2)  Agenda items. The council may allow public comment on an agenda item. These comments must be limited to the subject that is being debated. Anyone wishing to speak must be recognized by the mayor before addressing the council. 
                  (3)  Decorum. Members of the public shall not make inappropriate or offensive comments at a council meeting. Anyone who violates this rule may be ruled out of order by the mayor or on a point of order made by a councilmember. A majority vote of the council will rule on the point of order. Anyone who violates the rules of decorum may be removed from the meeting at the direction of the mayor. 
                  (Res. of 3-21-2002) 
                  Sec. 2-49. - Public hearings. 
                  The council may schedule a public hearing for the purpose of soliciting public comments on any subject of interest to the council. Hearings may be held immediately prior to or following a meeting of the council or at such other places and times as the council may determine. No official action shall be taken at any such public hearing. 
                  (Res. of 3-21-2002) 
                  Sec. 2-50. - Rules of order—Amendments. 
                  Any amendments to the rules of order must be submitted by a councilmember, in writing, to the city manager three business days before a regular meeting of the council. The proposed amendment shall be included in the agenda for that meeting and distributed to all councilmembers. All amendments require a two-thirds vote of the council to be adopted. 
                  Sec. 2-51. - Rules of order—Suspension. 
                  Rules of order may be suspended in the case of an emergency. A motion to suspend the rules requires a second, is debatable, and requires a two-thirds vote of the council. Rules governing quorum, voting methods and requirements, the notification to councilmembers of meetings, and rules necessary for compliance with state law cannot be suspended. 
                  Sec. 2-52. - Visual and sound recordings in public meetings.

                  DIVISION 2. - PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE 

                  Sec. 2-71. - Rules of procedure. 
                  Unless otherwise provided in this Code, procedures for meetings of the city council shall follow an edition of Robert's Rules of Order prescribed by the mayor. 
                  Sec. 2-72. - Parliamentarian. 
                  The city attorney shall serve as the parliamentarian for council meetings. 
                  (Res. of 3-21-2002) 
                  Sec. 2-73. - Main motion. 
                  In order for the council to take any official action on any subject, a councilmember must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the chairman until another councilmember agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the councilmember seconding the motion to support the motion. A councilmember may withdraw a main motion that he has made at any time before the council has voted on that motion. 
                  Sec. 2-74. - Debate. 
                  (a)  Management. After the main motion is recognized by the chairman, the council shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the chairman in a manner that is fair to all members of the council. Councilmembers may participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the chairman. 
                  (b)  Subsidiary motions. During the course of debate, councilmembers may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the council take a particular action on a motion. There are two classes of subsidiary motions: debatable subsidiary motions and undebatable subsidiary motions. Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee, and postpone to a time certain. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: limit debate, vote immediately, and lay on the table. They require a second and cannot be debated. 
                  (c)  Privileged motions. Councilmembers may also introduce privileged motions. Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on privileged motions. 
                  Sec. 2-75. - Voting procedure for debatable and undebatable motions. 
                  Voting on debatable motions and voting on undebatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways: 
                  a.  If debate has been completed and no other councilmember wishes to speak, the chairman can call for the vote; if there are no objections, then the chairman can proceed with the vote. 
                  b.  If the chairman calls for the vote and there is an objection, a member of the council may move to vote immediately ("move the previous question"). If this motion is seconded and approved by a two-thirds vote, debate will stop. The chairman will then read the proposed motion to the council and ask for the votes of the councilmembers. 
                  (2)  Undebatable motions. In the case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the chairman. The chairman shall read the proposed motion to the council and then call for the vote. 
                  Sec. 2-76. - Ranking of subsidiary and privileged motions. 
                  (a)  Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the council returns to consider the motion of lower precedence. 
                  (b)  A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and will take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section. Motions at the bottom of the following list take precedence over motions at the top of the list. 
                  (1)  Main motion (lowest rank). 
                  (2)  Subsidiary motions (debatable): 
                  a.  Postpone indefinitely. 
                  b.  Amend. 
                  c.  Refer to committee (commit). 
                  d.  Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). 
                  (3)  Subsidiary motions (undebatable): 
                  a.  Limit debate or extend limits. 
                  b.  Vote immediately (previous question). 
                  c.  Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). 
                  (4)  Privileged motions (undebatable): 
                  a.  Question of privilege. 
                  b.  Recess. 
                  c.  Adjourn (highest rank). 
                  Sec. 2-77. - Motions—Subsidiary. 
                  During the course of debate, councilmembers may introduce motions that propose that the council take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions and they allow the council to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions—amend, limit debate, and vote immediately—also may apply to other subsidiary motions. 
                  (1)  Postpone indefinitely. If a councilmember believes that the main motion should not be considered by the council, that councilmember may move to postpone the consideration of the main motions indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled. A motion to postpone indefinitely may be debated, but it cannot be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (2)  Amend. If a councilmember believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion. 
                  a.  Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend. 
                  b.  Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a time certain, and recess can also be amended. 
                  c.  A motion cannot be amended more than two times. 
                  d.  Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable. 
                  e.  A majority vote is required for the council to adopt an amendment. 
                  f.  If the amendment is adopted, the council shall consider the amended version of the motion. 
                  (3)  Refer to a committee (commit). If a councilmember believes that further information is needed before the council can act on a main motion, he may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, then a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to refer should specify the date that the committee or department will report back to the council. This motion is debatable and amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (4)  Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a councilmember believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. It is debatable and can be amended. If this motion is passed, the chairman will bring the original motion back to the council for consideration at the specified time. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (5)  Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the councilmember who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion, and a two-thirds vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (6)  Vote immediately (previous question). If a councilmember believes that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the councilmember may move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable, and a vote of two-thirds of the council is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (7)  Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the meeting. The motion can be brought up for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the council during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion, and the motion is not amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  Sec. 2-78. - Motions—Privileged. 
                  Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting. They do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on these motions. 
                  (1)  Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the chairman concerning the rights of a councilmember or of the council as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The chairman is required to make a ruling on the question. 
                  (2)  Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on this motion, but the motion can be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (3)  Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a councilmember must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion and, as a result, it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second, but is not debatable or amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  Sec. 2-79. - Motions—Incidental. 
                  Incidental motions allow councilmembers to exert their rights as members of the council. Incidental motions can be introduced at any time during a meeting. 
                  (1)  Appeal. If a councilmember disagrees with a decision that is made by the chairman, that councilmember may appeal the decision. If the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the council. The chairman has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The council may then debate the appeal. The council shall decide by majority vote if the chairman's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is high in precedence and can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (2)  Parliamentary inquiry. If a councilmember has a question about the rules of order, he may ask the chairman to give an opinion on that question. This question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the council. This motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. This motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (3)  Point of order (question of order). If a councilmember believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chairman can make a ruling on the question or can allow the council to debate and then rule on the question by majority vote. A point of order can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (4)  Point of information (request for information). If a councilmember has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, he may ask a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the chairman and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required and the motion is not debatable or amendable. 
                  Sec. 2-80. - Motions—Supplementary main. 
                  Three motions allow the council to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the council. These motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the ways specified. 
                  (1)  Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the council to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress. It allows the council to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any councilmember may make a motion to reconsider, and any councilmember may second the motion. The motion is debatable, but it cannot be amended. A majority vote of the council is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided and the council will return to debate and revote the original motion. 
                  (2)  Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the council overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any councilmember. It is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the councilmember seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting pursuant to section 2-43. The motion to rescind will then be placed on the agenda for the next meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will formally be made. If it is seconded, then the council shall debate and vote on rescission. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided. 
                  (3)  Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the council to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. This motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. It is a main motion, but ranks higher than any debatable motion. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.

                  (a)  It shall be unlawful for the licensee or any employee of a malt beverage, liquor, or pouring outlet to consume any intoxicating beverage while on duty at the outlet, or to be on duty at the outlet in an intoxicated condition.

                  Sec. 6-184. - Prohibition of certain types of entertainment, attire and conduct. 
                  (a)  Findings; public purpose. Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; City of Rome and Floyd County, Georgia; Amarillo, Texas; Austin, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Houston, Texas; Renton, Washington; Phoenix, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; St. Paul, Minnesota; Tucson, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana, which experiences, we believe are relevant to the problems faced by the City of Aragon, the council takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the findings of the commission that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. To that end, this section is hereby adopted. 
                  (b)  Enactment. The following types of entertainment, attire and conduct are prohibited upon any premises licensed to sell, serve or disperse alcohol beverages: 
                  (1)  The employment or use of any person, in any capacity, in the sale or service of alcohol beverages while such person is unclothed or in such attire, costume or clothing, as to expose to view any portion of the female breast below the top of the areola or any portion of the male or female pubic hair, anus, cleft or the buttocks, vulva and genitals. 
                  (2)  Live entertainment.

                  (1)  There shall be no refund of license fees for licensed outlets which close during a calendar year. 
                  (2)  New outlets beginning after August 1 shall require licenses issued on the basis of six months and shall pay 50 percent of the annual license fee. 
                  (3)  Where established outlets, operating under an annual license, are sold or otherwise conveyed (thus requiring a new license), the new license fee shall be determined according to a monthly proration. In this context "monthly" shall mean on the basis of whole months.

                  Sec. 8-101. - Purpose and findings. 
                  (a)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition. Otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult entertainment establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests; reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. 
                  (b)  Findings. Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; DeKalb County, Georgia; Richmond County, Georgia; Amarillo, Texas; Austin, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Houston, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona; Augusta, Georgia; LaGrange, Georgia; Dalton and Whitfield County, Georgia; Carrollton, Georgia; Smyrna, Georgia; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences, we believe are relevant to the problems faced by the City of Cave Spring, Georgia, the city council takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the findings of the council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. Based on these findings, this article is adopted to regulate certain types of businesses and to establish where such activity may or may not be conducted.

                  Sec. 10-82. - Findings. 
                  (a)  The city, in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community and its wildlife by prohibiting the feeding of as well as creating a condition which results in a congregation or congestion of domestic and migratory waterfowl within the city, finds that feeding the waterfowl increases the potential for damage to public parks, may cause water quality problems and may increase the potential for the spread of disease to residents. 
                  (b)  In addition, it is the intent of this article to protect the welfare of the waterfowl and migratory birds themselves, since wildlife studies have shown that the feeding of waterfowl and migratory birds can interrupt their normal migration patterns, cause nutritional problems, and promote the spread of serious waterfowl/migratory bird diseases such as avian cholera, plague and botulism. 
                  (c)  It is also the intent of this article to minimize the attraction of these birds by restricting their feeding and other acts that encourage the birds to halt their migrations and to reside in the city.

                  Sec. 10-86. - Penalties.

                  Sec. 15-35. - Complaint in rem in municipal court; procedure; lien; appeal. 
                  (a)  Whenever a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of the municipality charging that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property and make a written report of his findings.

                  (7)  The presence of graffiti which is visible from adjoining public or private property. 
                  (b)  If the public officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall file a complaint in rem in the municipal court of the city against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties in such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the interested parties that a hearing will be held before the municipal court at a date and time certain and at a place within the county or municipality where the property is located. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the proper court. The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing. 
                  (c)  If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state, in writing, findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
                  (1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation; and, if applicable, to secure by closing the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
                  (2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
                  For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered; and, provided further, that if the unsatisfactory condition is limited solely to the presence of graffiti, the dwelling, building or structure shall not be ordered demolished or closed, but its owner may be ordered to repair the same by cleaning or removal of the graffiti. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, chapter 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
                  (d)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer shall cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved, or to be vacated and closed, or demolished within 270 days of the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or any equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action shall commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
                  "This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
                  (e)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
                  (f)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
                  (g)  The lien provided for in subsection (f) of this section shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under section 15-36. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall, within 90 days of the completion of repairs, demolition or closure, forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. 
                  (h)  It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. § 48-4-5; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply; provided, further, that redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. The tax commissioner may initiate enforcement of liens imposed under this section at any time following receipt of the final determination of costs from the public officer. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
                  (i)  The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the municipality whose ordinance is being enforced. The tax commissioner may retain an amount equal to the cost of administering collection of the lien. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
                  (j)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
                  (k)  Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

                  (2)  At least 14 days prior to the date of the hearing, the public officer shall mail copies of the complaint and summons by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, return receipt requested, to all interested parties whose identities and addresses are readily ascertainable. Copies of the complaint and summons shall also be mailed by first-class mail to the property address to the attention of the occupants, if any; 
                  (3)  For interested parties whose mailing address is unknown, a notice stating the date, time, and place of the hearing shall be published in the newspaper in which the sheriffs advertisements appear in such county once a week for two consecutive weeks prior to the hearing; and 
                  (4)  A notice of lis pendens shall be filed in the office of the clerk of superior court in which the dwelling, building, structure, or property is located at the time of filing the complaint in municipal court. 
                  (b)  The public officer shall cause an affidavit of service to be filed of record in the municipal court prior to the hearing showing compliance with the service requirements of this section. Such affidavit shall constitute a prima facie showing of minimum procedural due process and shall constitute sufficient proof that service was perfected. 
                  (c)  Orders and other filings made subsequent to service of the initial complaint shall be served in the manner provided in this section on every interested party who answers the complaint or appears at the hearing. Any interested party who fails to answer or appear at the hearing shall be deemed to have waived all further notice in the proceedings.

                  It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, life safety and general welfare of properties and occupiers of buildings and structures within the city in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the city. Approval of a permit and inspection of a property shall in no manner guarantee or warrant to the owner or occupants thereof that said property has been constructed, maintained, or operated in conformance with applicable codes, laws and regulations. The city reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any federal or state law, regulation, or ordinance requires compliance as a condition precedent to the issuance of a permit, plan or design approval, inspection or other activity by the city, its officers, employees and agents, issuance of such permit, approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver or estoppel of the condition precedent, and it shall remain the obligation and responsibility of the owner, his design professional(s), and contractor(s) to satisfy such legal requirements.

                  (b)  Any person who shall allow any boisterous, noisy, drunken or riotous persons to assemble or remain in their house, apartment or upon their property, after receiving oral notice from a police officer that boisterous, noisy, drunken or carousing activities have caused complaint and annoyance to the common disturbance of the neighborhood or orderly citizens, shall be guilty of an offense against the city; provided, however, no person shall be charged under this subsection unless the owner or person in possession of the premises has been afforded an opportunity to disburse the assembly or offending person from the premises. This subsection shall not preclude a police officer from arresting any individual for criminal trespass where such individual knowingly and without authority remains on private property after being notified by the owner or lawful occupant to depart.

                  (c)  In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia.

                  DIVISION 3. - MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS 

                  Sec. 18-271. - Application and installation of control measures and practices. 
                  Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities; therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not excluded by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of sections 18-272 and 18-273. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities, and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity. 
                  Sec. 18-272. - Best management practices. 
                  (a)  Best management practices, as set forth in this section and section 18-273, shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b) of this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f). As used in this section, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed to control soil erosion and sedimentation for all rainfall events up to and including a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event. 
                  (b)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten NTUs for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. 
                  (c)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or by the division or of any general permit for construction activities issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f) for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (d)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  Sec. 18-273. - Conservation and engineering practices. 
                  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this article for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices, to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the state soil and water conservation commission, as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading, and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion. 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum. 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential. 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected, and supplemented. 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum. 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable. 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development. 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable. 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of this article. 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills. 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property. 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners. 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts, except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum. 
                  (14)  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on the site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 18-272(b). 
                  (15)  Land disturbing activities shall not be conducted within 25 feet of the banks of any state waters, as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented; however, buffers of at least 25 feet, established pursuant to chapter 5, article 5, part 6 of the Metropolitan River Protection Act, shall remain in force, unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. 
                  (16)  Land disturbing activities shall not be conducted within 100 horizontal feet, as measured from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, of the banks of any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to the state Water Quality Act, O.C.G.A. §§ 12-5-20—12-5-53, unless a variance for such activity is granted by the director, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. 
                  Sec. 18-274. - Adoption of requirements exceeding article standards. 
                  Nothing contained in this article shall prevent an issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions that contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in sections 18-272 and 18-273.

                  ARTICLE V. - WETLAND PROTECTION 

                  Sec. 18-311. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. 
                  (b)  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
                  (c)  It is therefore necessary for the city to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands.

                  Sec. 18-312. - Purpose, objective of article. 
                  (a)  The purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational, and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable, as determined through a permitting process. 
                  (b)  The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations that will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic nature, and wildlife habitat.

                  Functions means the beneficial roles that wetlands serve, including storage, conveyance and attenuation of floodwater and stormwater; protection of water quantity and quality and reduction of erosion; habit for wildlife, including rare, threatened, and endangered species; food chain support for a wide variety of wildlife and fisheries; educational, historical, and archeological value protection; and scenic, aesthetic, and recreational amenities. 
                  Generalized wetland map means a map showing the general locations of wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city. 
                  Hydric soils means soils that form as a result of saturated soil conditions. A list of these soils is maintained by the soil conservation service. 
                  Hydrophytic vegetation means macrophytic plants tolerant of, or dependent on, saturated soil conditions. 
                  Jurisdictional determination means an official, written statement or map signed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or, in the case of coastal marshlands, the state department of natural resources. 
                  Jurisdictional wetland means a wetland area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands, as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
                  Temporary emergency permit means a temporary permit that may be issued in certain circumstances specified in section 18-316(6). 
                  Wetland means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and distribution sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, commonly known as hydrophytic vegetation. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. 
                  Wetland delineation means the establishment of wetland boundaries by a representative of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or authority designated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

                  Sec. 18-314. - Generalized wetland map; district boundaries. 
                  The generalized wetland map is a general reference document; and wetland boundaries indicated on the map are approximations. The purpose of the generalized wetland map is to alert developers/landowners if they are within proximity to a wetland, which means that there is a high likelihood of the presence of a jurisdictional wetland and a need for the developer/landowner to seek U.S. Army Corps of Engineers guidance as to whether a section 404 permit will be required prior to any activity. The generalized wetland map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the jurisdiction of the city, and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this article does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.

                  Sec. 22-20. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of Aragon, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. of 11-20-2008, art. 1, § B) 
                  Sec. 22-21. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

                  (2)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
                  (3)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
                  (4)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
                  (5)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
                  (6)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; and

                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. The term "freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is: 
                  (1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
                  (2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
                  (3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places and determined as eligible by states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
                  (4)  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places and determined as eligible by communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
                  a.  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
                  b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this Code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
                  National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after September 2, 1988 [the effective date of the initial FIRM] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, the term "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after September 2, 1988 [the effective date of the FIRST floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after September 2, 1988 [the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA Flood Modernization Maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis; 
                  (2)  400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
                  (3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure.) 
                  Note : Accessory structures are NOT exempt from any ordinance requirements. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement 
                  (1)  The term "substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. 
                  Note : The market value of the structure should be: 
                  a.  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
                  b.  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
                  (2)  The term "substantial improvement" includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  (3)  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  (4)  The term "substantial improvement" does not, however, include: 
                  a.  Those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project; or 
                  b.  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the zoning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The building inspector shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the zoning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

                  DIVISION 3. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 22-84. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include ANY fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and, 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article (section 22-88), the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms; 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable State requirements for resisting wind forces; 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 22-84(4), elevated buildings. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in section 22-55(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
                  1.  Individual lots or parcels; 
                  2.  In new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions; 
                  3.  In expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions; or 
                  4.  On a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood; 
                  must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Reference section 22-84(6).) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection (3)a. and c. of this section. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 22-25, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection (4)a. of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this division. 
                  (Ord. of 11-20-2008, art. 4, § B)

                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 22-25, then the building inspector shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this division. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following subsections (a)(2) and (3) of this section shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-Zone areas where a Limited Detail Study has been completed. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 22-84(4), elevated buildings. 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.

If the case shall be continued on account of the witness' absence, the court may issue an attachment against such witness, requiring him to show cause, on the day appointed for trial, why he should not be further dealt with for contempt. Any police officer, by virtue of such attachment, shall arrest and confine the person so as to have him before the court at such time as may be appointed for further hearing of the original complaint. 
                  Sec. 26-10. - Continuances. 
                  Where the ends of justice require it, cases may be continued. All continuances shall be addressed to the sound legal discretion of the court under the rules governing the superior court of this court. 
                  Sec. 26-11. - Plea of guilty in absence of defendant. 
                  Any person against whom any complaint is lodged or information given in the municipal court may file a plea of guilty under such regulations and upon such terms as the court may prescribe. If such person cannot attend the trial, the court may pass such order or sentence in the case as if the person were personally present. 
                  Sec. 26-12. - Persons other than defendant implicated to be tried. 
                  If, on the trial of any case before the municipal court, it appears that any other person besides the one on trial has violated a provision of this Code or any ordinance of the city, he may then and there be tried, if present, unless the case is continued for legal cause. 
                  Sec. 26-13. - Contempt of court. 
                  Any person who, during a sitting of the municipal court, shall be guilty of contempt of court, or refuse to abide by any sentence or order of such court, shall be punished in accordance with state law. 
                  Sec. 26-14. - Docket location and content. 
                  A docket shall be kept in the office of the clerk of court, on which shall appear the name of every defendant charged with a violation of this Code or any city ordinance, or of any offense over which the municipal court has jurisdiction. At the trial of all cases in the municipal court, the judge of the municipal court shall record, opposite the statement of the case, the punishment inflicted and the date; and the clerk of court shall enter, under the judge of the municipal court's sentence, the final disposition of the case; that is, whether the fine, if any, was collected and the date of such collection, and when and to whom such amounts were turned over by the clerk of court. 
                  Sec. 26-15. - Enforcement of penalties against corporations. 
                  Whenever a corporation shall violate any provision of this Code or any ordinance of the city, a warrant shall issue against such corporation for violating such provision; and the clerk of court shall issue a copy of such warrant, which shall be served by the director of public safety or chief of police or any police officer of the city upon any officer of the corporation to be found in the city, or upon the agent, superintendent, or person in charge of the business of the corporation in the city. The police officer serving such copy shall, at the time, notify the person upon whom such service is made of the time and place of trial; shall make an entry of such service upon the warrant, showing the time of service and upon whom the service was made; and shall return the warrant to the municipal court and docket the case, which case shall stand for trial in the order in which other cases against individuals for violation of ordinances of the city are tried. If, on the trial, the defendant corporation fails to appear or, appearing, fails to plead, the judge of the municipal court shall cause to be entered a plea of not guilty, and trial shall proceed as though the defendant had appeared and pleaded. Upon conviction of any corporation, there shall be rendered judgment against it for the fine imposed by the judge of the municipal court, together with all costs of prosecution, upon which judgment the clerk of court shall issue an execution against the defendant, which shall be levied and collected by the director of public safety or chief of police as tax executions in favor of the city are levied and collected.

                  Sec. 26-51. - Security; maximum amount. 
                  Any person authorized to do so pursuant to law may take bond, with security or without security, at his discretion, in a sum not exceeding $5,000.00 per violation or offense for the appearance of any person accused or suspected of being guilty of a violation of any provision of this Code or any ordinance of the city, or any offense over which the municipal court has jurisdiction, to stand to and abide by his trial before the municipal court; and also of witnesses to testify in any case pending or about to be commenced in such court. 
                  Sec. 26-52. - Passage and service of rule to show cause upon failure to appear. 
                  All bail taken under this chapter shall be special bail and the power of the security over the principal shall be the same as in special bail. Upon the failure to appear of any principal, in any bond or recognizance given by a person charged with a violation of any provision of this Code or any ordinance of the city, or of any offense over which the municipal court has jurisdiction, or by a witness to appear and testify, the judge of the municipal court shall pass a rule requiring the principal and sureties on such bond to show cause on any day therein named, not to be less than ten days from the passage of such rule, why they should not be required to pay the amount of such bond. A copy of such rule shall be served upon the principal of the sureties, by any officer or member of the police force, if found in the city, at least five days before the time therein set for hearing the rule. 
                  Sec. 26-53. - Judgment. 
                  If no sufficient cause is shown, the judge of the municipal court shall proceed to enter judgment against such principal and sureties for the amount of the bond forfeited as provided in section 26-52. The secretary shall issue execution for the amount of such judgment and place the judgement in the hands of the director of public safety or the chief of police, who shall proceed to collect the amount of judgement by levy and sale in case of tax executions. 
                  Sec. 26-54. - Surrender of principal. 
                  Any surety upon a bail bond of any person charged with a violation of a provision of this Code or a city ordinance, or of any offense over which the municipal court has jurisdiction, may surrender his principal at any time to the director of public safety or chief of police, who shall confine such principal, until discharged by order of the judge of the municipal court, or other proper officer, or by giving other and good security. The delivery of the principal as provided in this section shall discharge the sureties of all further liability upon such bond; provided that delivery shall be before any judgment of forfeiture upon the bond shall have been entered.

                  ARTICLE II. - OCCUPATIONAL TAXES 

                  Sec. 38-31. - Purpose and scope of article. 
                  The occupation tax levied in this article is for revenue purposes only and is not for regulatory purposes; nor is the payment of the tax made a condition precedent to the practice of any such profession, trade, or calling. The occupation tax only applies to those businesses and occupations which are covered by the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-13-5—48-13-26. All other applicable businesses and occupations are taxed by the local government pursuant to the pertinent general and/or local law and ordinance.

                  The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

                  Employee means any person, whether owner, family member, regular worker, or part-time worker, who accumulates 40 hours of work time per week at a particular business location. Part-time employees shall be computed on a 40-hour basis. For example, two part-time employees with 20 hours apiece shall be computed as one employee for the purpose of this article. Four employees with 30 hours each shall be computed as three employees (four employees at 30 hours equals a total of 120 hours divided by 40 hours equals three equivalent employees). 
                  Gross receipts : 
                  (1)  The term "gross receipts" means the total revenue of the business or practitioner for the period, including, without limitation, the following:

                  b.  Gain from trading in stocks, bonds, capital assets, or instruments of indebtedness; 
                  c.  Proceeds from commissions on the sale of property, goods, or services; 
                  d.  Proceeds from fees for services rendered; and 
                  e.  Proceeds from rent, interest, royalty, or dividend income.

                  d.  Payments made to a subcontractor or an independent agent. 
                  e.  Governmental and foundation grants, charitable contributions, or the interest income derived from such funds received by a nonprofit organization which employs salaried practitioners otherwise covered by this article, if such funds constitute 100 percent or more of the organization's receipts.

                  Occupation tax means a tax levied on persons, partnerships, corporations, or other entities for engaging in an occupation, profession, or business for revenue-raising purposes. 
                  Person means and includes sole proprietors, corporations, partnerships, nonprofits, or any other form of business organization, but specifically excludes charitable nonprofit organizations which utilize 100 percent of their proceeds for charitable purposes. 
                  Practitioner of profession and occupation means one who, by state law, requires state licensure regulating such profession or occupation. This term shall not include a practitioner who is an employee of a business, if the business pays an occupation tax. 
                  Regulatory fees means payments, whether designated as license fees, permit fees, or by another name, which are required by a local government as an exercise of its police power and as a part of or an aid to regulation of an occupation, profession, or business. The amount of a regulatory fee shall approximate the reasonable cost of the actual regulatory activity performed by the city. A regulatory fee may not include an administrative fee. Development impact fees, as defined by O.C.G.A. § 36-71-2(8), or other costs or conditions of zoning or land development are not regulatory fees.

All contents of such return shall be confidential and open only to the officials, employees, agents, or clerks of the city using such returns for the purpose of this occupation tax levy and the collection of the tax. Independent auditors or bookkeepers employed by the city shall be classed as employees.

The city clerk shall have the right to inspect the books or records for the business of which the return was made in the city, and, upon demand of the city clerk, such books or records shall be submitted for inspection by a representative of the city within 30 days. Failure of submission of such books or records within 30 days shall be grounds for revocation of the tax registration currently existing to do business in the city. Adequate records shall be kept in the city for examination by the city clerk at that officer's discretion. If, after examination of the books or records, it is determined that a deficiency occurs as a result of underreporting, a penalty of $25.00 will be assessed for the period delinquent.

                  In addition to the other remedies provided in this article for the collection of the occupation tax levied in this article, the city clerk, upon any tax or installment of such tax becoming delinquent and remaining unpaid, shall issue execution for the correct amount of such tax against the person liable for such tax, which such execution shall bear interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum from the date when such tax or installment becomes delinquent; and the lien shall cover the property in the city of the person liable for such tax, all as provided by the Charter and ordinances of the city, and state law. The lien of such occupation tax shall become fixed on and dated from the time when such tax or any installment thereof becomes delinquent. The execution shall be levied by the police chief or his representative upon the property of the defendant located in such jurisdiction; and sufficient property shall be advertised and sold to pay the amount of such execution, with interest and costs. All other proceedings in relation thereto shall be had as is provided by the Charter and ordinances of the city, and state law; and the defendant in such execution shall have rights of defense, by affidavit of illegality and otherwise, which are provided by the applicable laws in regard to tax executions. When a nulla bona entry has been entered by proper authority upon an execution issued by the city against any person defaulting on the occupation tax, the person against whom the entry was made shall not be allowed or entitled to have or collect any fees or charges whatsoever for services rendered after the entry of the nulla bona. If, at any time after the entry of nulla bona has been made, the person against whom the execution issues pays the tax in full, together with all interest and costs accrued on the tax, the person may collect any fees and charges due him as though he had never defaulted in the payment of the taxes.

                  11.3.1  Administrative review. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the building inspector in the enforcement of this ordinance [appendix]; 
                  11.3.2  Variances. To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of the ordinance [appendix] as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owning to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance [appendix] will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of the ordinance [appendix] shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. (The existence of a nonconforming use of neighboring land, buildings, or structures in the same district or of permitted or nonconforming uses in other districts shall not constitute a reason for the requested variance.) Such variance may be granted in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the board of appeals that all of the following conditions exist: 
                  (A)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape or topography; 
                  (B)  The application of this ordinance [appendix] to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; 
                  (C)  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; 
                  (D)  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purpose and intent of this ordinance [appendix], provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this ordinance [appendix]. 
                  Sec. 11.4. - Appeals, hearings, and notice. 
                  Appeals to the board of appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the City of Aragon affected by any decision of the building inspector. Such appeal shall be taken within 60 days, by filing with the building inspector and with the board of appeals a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The building inspector shall forthwith transmit to the board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. 
                  The board of appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of appeals or other matters referred to it, and give at least 15 days' public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time.

                  Sec. 11.5. - Stay of proceedings. 
                  An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the building inspector certifies to the board of appeals after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the board of appeals or by a court of record on application, on notice to the building inspector, and on due cause shown. 
                  Sec. 11.6. - Decisions of the board of appeals. 
                  In exercising its powers, the board of appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance [appendix], reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirements, decision, or determination, and to that end shall have all the powers of the building inspector and may issue or direct the issuance of a building permit. 
                  The concurring vote of two members of the board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the building inspector, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required, to pass under this ordinance [appendix] or to affect any variation of this ordinance [appendix]. 
                  On all appeals, applications and other matters brought before the board of appeals, said board shall inform, in writing, all the parties involved of its decisions and the reasons therefor. Recourse from a decision by the board of appeals shall be to the city council.

                  ARTICLE III. - PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL (NONEXEMPT LAND DIVISIONS) 

                  Sec. 3.1. - Application for preliminary plat approval. 
                  A subdivider or developer shall apply for preliminary plat approval by submitting to the city clerk the following: 
                  (a)  Name, address and telephone number of the person to whom any notices of hearings by the planning commission shall be sent; 
                  (b)  Eight copies of the preliminary plat; 
                  (c)  A copy of the soil erosion and sedimentation plan as drawn by a registered surveyor or engineer; 
                  (d)  A copy of the soil erosion and sedimentation permit (land disturbance permit) as issued by the certifying authority; 
                  (e)  Other related documents as may be appropriate, including, but not limited to, environmental impact permit or stormwater control permit; and 
                  (f)  A nonrefundable application fee as established by the city council. This fee shall be required for each phase of any proposed subdivision or land division. Preliminary review shall not begin until established fees have been paid. 
                  Sec. 3.2. - Review of preliminary plat. 
                  City staff shall perform a preliminary technical review and shall forward a copy of the plat to the city attorney for a preliminary legal review. The preliminary and technical review shall be completed within 30 days from the date the subdivider or developer applies for preliminary plat approval. City staff shall return the plat to the subdivider or developer for any necessary corrections. If there are any unusual or extraordinary expenses created by the preliminary technical or legal review, then such expenses shall be borne by the subdivider or developer. 
                  Sec. 3.3. - Planning commission review. 
                  Once the preliminary technical and legal reviews are completed, all necessary corrections are made, and all unusual expenses paid, then the city staff shall submit the plat, preliminary legal and technical opinions, and supporting environmental and related technical documents to the planning commission. The planning commission shall either schedule a hearing or place the preliminary plat on the agenda for its next regularly scheduled monthly meeting, and the subdivider or developer shall be notified of the date, time, and place for the hearing. 
                  At the hearing the planning commission shall give either tentative approval or disapproval to the preliminary plat. A notation of the commission's actions shall be made on three copies of the preliminary plat with one copy being returned to the subdivider or developer, one copy being returned to the city clerk and one copy being retained by the planning commission. Approval of the preliminary plat does not constitute approval of a final plat; it only approves use of the layout as a guide to the preparation of a final plat. Preliminary plat approval shall expire and be null and void after a period of one year unless an extension of time is granted by the planning commission. If a preliminary plat is granted tentative approval, the planning commission may make such approval conditioned upon certain requirements being met. If the subdivider or developer does not comply with the requirements of conditional approval, then the approval is automatically voided and no approval will be granted to the final plat. 
                  The planning commission shall have a minimum of 30 days after submission of a preliminary plat to take action on said preliminary plat. The planning commission shall have a maximum of 90 days to take action on the preliminary plat. If the planning commission fails to take action on the preliminary plat within the 90 days after the date the plat is forwarded from the city clerk to the planning commission, then the preliminary plat shall be considered approved and a certificate of approval shall be issued on demand. However, the applicant may waive this requirement and agree to an extension of time. 
                  If any of the requirements of this ordinance [appendix] are modified or waived under the variance provision, the reasons for such shall be specified in writing to the subdivider/applicant and to the city clerk. No construction is to start until the preliminary plans are approved. 
                  Sec. 3.4. - Requirements. 
                  The preliminary plat shall meet the minimum standards of design as set forth in these regulations and as set forth in the Georgia Plat Act and shall include the following information:

                  Developers shall be responsible for damages and maintenance of previously accepted streets when construction traffic of new phases/developments impact severely on existing city streets. The developer's maintenance bond may be used for these off-site repairs and maintenance, should the developer fail to take necessary corrective actions. 
                  Sec. 4.5. - Prohibited activities. 
                  The clerk of the superior court shall not file of [or] record a plat of a subdivision or land division which does not have the approval as required by this ordinance [appendix]. The submission for filing or recording of a plat of a subdivision without the approval as required by these regulations is hereby declared a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, is punishable as provided by law. 
                  ARTICLE V. - MINIMUM DESIGN STANDARDS 

                  Sec. 5.1. - General. 
                  In considering any preliminary plat or final plat, the City of Aragon Planning Commission shall give consideration to any master plan, or segments thereof, affecting the area in which the subdivision is located. 
                  Land which the City of Aragon Planning Commission has found to be unsuitable for subdivision due to flooding, bad drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, or other features likely to be harmful to the safety, health, and general welfare of the future residents shall not be subdivided unless adequate methods approved by the planning commission are formulated by the developer for meeting the problems created by the subdivision of such land. 
                  Land subject to flooding shall not be platted for residential occupancy or for such other uses as will increase the danger to health, life and property unless such land is not to be used as a building site. In applying this provision, land liable to flooding as determined from past history, or land which lies within the 100-year floodplain, shall be considered subject to flood. Fill shall not be used to raise the land in areas subject to flood unless the fill proposed does not restrict the flow of water and increase flood heights. 
                  (a)  An office mobile unit may be moved in by the developer for a 12-month period with an additional 12 months approved if necessary. 
                  (b)  No mobile home shall be permitted to be located in any subdivision or land division approved pursuant to these land division regulations [this appendix].

                  (a)  Authority of health department. Nothing contained in these regulations [this appendix] shall be construed as preventing the health department, after study of the conditions existing in a proposed subdivision, from requiring that all or any portion of the area of such subdivision shall not be built upon or that the minimum lot sizes set forth in these regulations are inadequate and must be increased to insure protection of public health. 
                  (b)  Building lines. Residential building setback lines shall be at least 35 feet from the front property line. Residential lots shall not be platted to front directly on the right-of-way of a major highway bearing a U.S. number designation unless such right-of-way contains a marginal access street. Setback lines shall be at least ten feet on each side and not less than 25 feet from the rear property line. 
                  (c)  City limit and lot lines. Lots shall be divided by corporate boundary lines. 
                  (d)  Corner lots. Corner lots shall be sufficiently large to permit the location of buildings so as to conform with the building lines on both streets. 
                  (e)  Double frontage. Double frontage lots (i.e., lots having street frontage both in front and rear) shall not be permitted. 
                  (f)  Lot lines. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved street lines. 
                  (g)  Minimum lot dimensions and area. All lots within a subdivision or land division shall contain no less than 33,000 square feet. 
                  (h)  Street access. Every lot hereafter established shall front or abut on a street which is to be dedicated to the public and conforms to the requirements of these regulations [this appendix], unless on an approved easement road.

                  ARTICLE VI. - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS 

                  Sec. 6.1. - Purpose. 
                  A well-designed subdivision or land division means little to a prospective lot buyer until such buyer can see actual physical transformation of raw land into lots with all necessary improvements provided. Likewise a well-designed subdivision is not an asset to the community until the necessary improvements have been installed. In order that prospective lot purchasers may get usable products and new subdivisions may be an asset rather than a liability to the community the subdivider shall install and/or pay for the improvements required by these regulations [this appendix] necessary to serve the subdivisions. 
                  Sec. 6.2. - Monuments. 
                  Lot corners shall be marked with an iron pin at least 24 inches long and driven flush or up to two inches above the finished grade. 
                  Sec. 6.3. - Natural gas. 
                  When gas lines are located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street. 
                  Sec. 6.4. - Water supply. 
                  Where public water is available at the property being subdivided, the subdivider shall install water mains and fire hydrants according to plans and specifications approved by the appropriate city official and approved by the health department. 
                  When the water main is located in the street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot before the street is surfaced. 
                  Sec. 6.5. - Sanitary sewerage. 
                  Where public sewerage is available at the property being subdivided and the topography is such that extension is feasible, the subdivider shall install public sanitary sewers to plans and specifications approved by the appropriate city official and approved by the health department. When the sewer is located in a street right-of-way and it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot prior to surfacing the street. 
                  Sec. 6.6. - Sewage disposal system.

Curbs and gutters shall be optional on new streets in a land division if serving parcels greater than five acres. Concrete curbs and gutters shall be installed according to plans and specifications approved by the appropriate city official. Curbs and gutters shall be in "roll" back and be 25 inches wide.

                  Sec. 6.9. - Storm drainage. 
                  An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches, pipes, culverts, storm sewers, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, and other necessary appurtenances, shall be installed by the subdivider according to plans and specifications approved by the appropriate city official. 
                  Sec. 6.10. - Street name signs and stop signs. 
                  Street name signs and stop signs shall be installed at all intersections within a subdivision at the developer's expense. The location and design of such signs shall be approved by the city. All intersections shall contain a minimum of two street name signs, and stop signs as appropriate for the intersections. 
                  Sec. 6.11. - Utility strips. 
                  The street right-of-way shall be graded at least ten feet, measured from the back of the curb or the edge of the pavement on both sides of the street, to provide space for installation of utilities, to prevent the encroachment of driveways into the street surface, to provide walkways off the paved vehicular surface, and to provide space for the future installation of sidewalks; provided, however, the City of Aragon Planning Commission may waive this requirement in cases where the subdivider can demonstrate that the topography of the land being subdivided is such that compliance with this provision would be impractical. 
                  Sec. 6.12. - Speed limit signs. 
                  Before final approval of streets, the developer shall post at each entrance to the subdivision a sign showing the speed limit for the subdivision streets, as set by the city council.

                  Sec. 7.1. - Surety for completion. 
                  In lieu of the completion of the required improvements previous to the final approval of a plat, the City of Aragon City Council may accept a bond, in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to it and approved by the City of Aragon Planning Commission, providing for and securing to the city the actual construction and installation of such improvements and utilities within a period specified by the city council and expressed in the bond. 
                  Sec. 7.2. - Warranty. 
                  The developer shall provide a one-year warranty in the amount of ten percent of the total development/construction cost to ensure that any failed items are addressed. The warranty may be a bond, certified check, or irrevocable letter of credit from a lending institution. 
                  Sec. 7.3. - Legal review. 
                  All bonds or warranties provided for compliance with this article shall be subject to legal review by the city attorney prior to acceptance by the City of Aragon.

Any party filing, recording or attempting to file or record a plat of a subdivision by any employee of the clerk of the superior court, with intent to deceive or to evade these standards and regulations, without the approval of the city for such plat as required by this ordinance [appendix], shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and may suffer such penalties as may be imposed by law.

                  The transfer, sale, agreement to sell, or negotiation to sell land by reference to, exhibition of, or other use of a plat of a subdivision as defined in these regulations [this appendix] that has not been approved by the city and recorded in the Office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Polk County is prohibited.
