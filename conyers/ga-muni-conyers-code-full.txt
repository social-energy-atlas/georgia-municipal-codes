PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Conyers, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1990 Code, as updated through May 4, 2011, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Mayor and Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1990 Code, as updated, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Title, Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The title, chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of three parts separated by a dash. The first figure before the dash refers to the title number, the second figure after the first dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the last dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of title 1, chapter 1 is numbered 1-1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 of title 2 is 2-6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its title and chapter, and at the same time, new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 2-6-1 and 2-6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 2-6-1.5. New chapters and new articles may be included in the same way or, in the case of chapters, may be placed at the end of the title embracing the subject, and, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new chapter or article. New titles can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

(12)  Refunds or credits for overpayment.

The claim shall be audited. If the claim is approved by the City, the excess amount paid may be credited on any amounts then due and payable from the person or innkeeper by whom it was paid or his administrators, executors or successors in interest as he may direct, or shall be refunded if no amount then remains due and payable.

CHAPTER 5. - SIGNS 

Sec. 8-5-1. - Short title. 
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Conyers Sign Ordinance. 
(Code 1990, § 8-5-1; Ord. No. 666, 11-20-2002; Ord. No. 830, § II, 5-18-2011) 
Sec. 8-5-2. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  The Mayor and City Council finds that signs provide an important medium through which persons may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and a detriment to property values and to the City's general public welfare, as well as create an aesthetic nuisance. By enacting this article, the Mayor and City Council intends to: 
(1)  Balance the rights of persons to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
(2)  Protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens and others within the City; 
(3)  Reduce traffic hazards, pedestrian hazards, and other hazards; 
(4)  Promote and maintain the aesthetic qualities of the City; 
(5)  Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
(6)  Promote economic development; 
(7)  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations; 
(8)  Promote the stated purposes of the City Zoning Ordinance, as amended, which are expressly incorporated herein; and 
(9)  Promote the stated purposes of the International Building Code, as adopted and modified by the City, which are expressly incorporated herein; 
(10)  Except to the extent allowed by applicable Federal and State law, nothing herein is intended to in any way preempt any Federal or State law requirements regarding signs or to exempt any person or entity from compliance therewith. 
(b)  Some signage has a single targeted function and identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of providing addresses which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Signs at the entrances to or within subdivisions or major developments favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate entrances and internal sites for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this section, the provisions of this section are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow maximum expressive potential to sign owners.

A nonconforming sign may be repaired to the extent necessary to maintain it in a safe condition and neat and orderly appearance. A change in the message on the sign shall not constitute an alternation or modification of the sign, so long as no change is made to the structure supporting the message. Specifically change of a static face sign to an LED or other type electronic sign shall not constitute a permissible alteration of a nonconforming use. 
(b)  No structural repair or change in shape, size or design, shall be permitted except to make a nonconforming sign comply with all requirements of this section or to render the sign structurally sound; provided that any sign damaged or destroyed by Act of God may be restored to its pre-damaged condition, but no change in design or materials can be made. Routine maintenance and changing of copy shall be permitted as long as such maintenance or changing of copy does not result in or change the shape, size, height or design of the sign.

(1)  Interstate principal arterial. An interstate principal arterial is a multi-lane controlled access road which only allows access at designated interchanges. The purpose of the interstate is to transport people and goods over long distances at high speeds with a minimum amount of friction from entering and exiting traffic. Freeways typically have average daily traffic volumes of over 100,000 vehicles per day. 
(2)  Principal arterial. A principal arterial is used to transport large volumes of traffic at moderate speeds and is typically multi-lane. A principal arterial is usually a median divided highway with some controlled access. These roads provide immediate access to adjacent land uses through driveways and two way turn lanes in the center of the multi-lane arterial. A principal arterial is designed for typical capacity of 45,000 to 75,000 vehicles per day. 
(3)  Minor arterial. A minor arterial is designed to provide cross-town and cross-county street access. These roadways are usually multi-lane, although in some less developed areas they may be two lane roads. With access to development, there are often driveways that run directly into thoroughfares and, occasionally, on-street parking. A minor arterial is designed for typical capacity of between 20,000 and 50,000 vehicles per day. 
(4)  Major collectors. A major collector is designed to move traffic from large residential areas and other local traffic generators such as schools, parks, office and retail areas to principal and minor arterials. Generally these are two to four lane roads with frequent intersections. Traffic volumes are between 15,000 and 30,000 vehicles per day. 
(5)  Minor collectors. Minor collectors are roads designated to collect traffic from local networks of City streets and county roads and transport this traffic to the arterial system. Collectors are typically two to four lane facilities with an average daily traffic volume between 7,500 and 15,000 vehicles. 
(6)  Local roads and streets. These roads exist primarily to provide access to adjacent land; and serve low-mileage trips compared to collectors or other higher systems. Use of these roads and streets for through traffic is usually discouraged. Local roads and streets constitute the mileage not classified as part of the principal arterial, minor arterial, or collector system.

(2)  Thereafter, the City shall accept the improvements for dedication in accordance with procedures in Section 8-6-26(d). 
(3)  It shall be the sole responsibility of the developer to petition the City for release of the security. 
(f)  Reduction of security. 
(1)  If the security posted by the developer was a cash escrow, the amount of that escrow shall be reduced upon actual acceptance of the dedication of public improvements to the ratio that the cost of the public improvements for which dedication was accepted bears to the total cost of all public improvements for the subdivision. In no event shall a cash escrow be reduced below 25 percent of the principal amount. The residual funds shall be security for the developer's promise to maintain the required public improvements and its warranty that the improvements are free from defect. At the end of the maintenance and warranty period, all remaining escrowed funds shall be released to the developer. Funds held in the escrow account shall not be released to the developer, in whole or in part, except upon express written instructions of the City Attorney. 
(2)  If the security provided by the developer was a letter of credit, the City Attorney shall execute waivers of the City's right to withdraw funds under the credit upon actual acceptance of the dedication of public improvements to the ratio that the cost of the public improvement for which dedication was accepted bears to the total cost of all public improvements for the subdivision. 
(g)  Maintenance of improvements. 
(1)  The developer shall be required to maintain all required public improvements and required improvements on the individual subdivided lots until final inspection, approval, and acceptance of dedication of the improvements by the City. 
(2)  If and when the City accepts the offer of dedication for the last completed required public improvement, the City shall execute a waiver of its right to receive all but 25 percent of the funds represented by the letter of credit or cash escrow if the developer is not in breach of the subdivision improvement agreement. The residual funds shall be security for the developer's promise to maintain the required public improvements and its warranty that the improvements shall remain free from defect, as provided below in Subsection (k) of this section. 
(h)  Issuance of building permits and certificates of occupancy. If a subdivision improvement agreement, performance guarantee and security have been approved for a subdivision, no building permits shall be issued for lots in such subdivision unless: 
(1)  The street base required under Section 8-6-81 shall be in place, as well as the binder course, if applicable. 
(2)  Streets are designed to divert stormwater runoff into approved storm drainage systems. 
(i)  Building permits.

(j)  Certificates of occupancy. If a subdivision improvement agreement, performance guarantee and security have been approved for a subdivision, no certificate of occupancy for any building in the subdivision shall be issued prior to the completion of the required public improvements and the acceptance of the dedication of those improvements by the City, as required in the approved final plat. 
(k)  Maintenance security. 
(1)  The developer of a subdivision shall provide to the City a security in the form of a cash escrow or irrevocable letter of credit accompanying a covenant to maintain each required public improvement for a period of one year following the acceptance by the City of the dedication of that completed public improvement. 
(2)  Said covenant shall also warrant continuous maintenance of said public improvements for a period of not less than one year following the acceptance by the City of the dedication of the last completed public improvement. 
(3)  Such security shall be in an amount of not less than 25 percent of the total estimated cost of all the public improvements for the subdivision. 
(4)  Upon a finding based on inspection by the Director, that the developer has failed to adequately maintain such required public improvements, and upon ten day's written notice to the developer by certified mail, the City may either perform such maintenance or cause such maintenance to be performed, and draw funds from the security sufficient to pay all the costs of such required maintenance, plus an administrative fee of ten percent. Any costs and fees incurred by the City in performing such maintenance that are in excess of the available funds in the cash escrow or letter of credit shall be recovered by the City through a lien placed on any property owned by the developer in the City. 
(5)  In the event that the property subject to the maintenance bond is also subject to a subdivision improvement agreement with a performance guarantee and security as required in Subsection (b) of this section, the maintenance security required in this section may be satisfied through retaining the final 25 percent of the balance of the security for the maintenance guarantee, as provided in Subsection (g)(2) of this section. 
(l)  Performance security for stormwater management facilities. 
(1)  Upon approval of the stormwater management plan, but before the issuance of a land disturbance permit, the developer shall be required to post a performance bond, cash escrow, certified check or other acceptable form of performance security for construction of the proposed stormwater system. 
a.  Amount of security. The amount of security shall be 125 percent of the total estimated construction costs of the facilities required by the stormwater management plan.

Sec. 8-6-75. - Street classification and right-of-way requirements. 
(a)  Street classification. 
(1)  Streets are classified into a street hierarchy system based on road function and traffic volumes. Streets are classified into the following categories: 
a.  Interstate principal arterials; 
b.  Principal arterials; 
c.  Minor arterials; 
d.  Collector streets; and 
e.  Local streets in urban area boundaries. 
(2)  The application for approval of a preliminary plat, site development plan, or building permit that will require the applicant to construct new public streets or make improvements to existing public streets shall determine the design of the street based on projected traffic volumes and use the right-of-way and lane widths as noted in the table of minimum right-of-way and lane widths. The final determination regarding the classification of any existing or proposed street shall be made by the Director. 
(b)  Right-of-way and lane widths. 
(1)  Minimum widths for new streets or roads shall be as shown in table of minimum right-of-way and lane widths. See the City Standard Design and Construction Details for detailed dimensions. Total width of streets includes lane width plus curb and gutter (back to back of curb) or from edge of pavement if no curbs exist. Local streets will use a 24-inch curb and gutter. Other road/street classifications will use a 30-inch curb and gutter. If an existing street is used for access, the developer shall conform to the existing street width if it is greater than is required for a new street in these subdivision regulations. 
(2)  Minimum widths of right-of-way and lanes shall be as shown in the table of right-of-way and lane widths as follows: 

 
Notes: 
*Lane widths include only pavement width. Example: Two lanes at 11 feet with two feet C and G would be 26 feet back to back of curb. 
10-feet lanes are allowed in Conservation Subdivision Overlay District. 
Lane widths on collector streets and other local (nonsubdivision) streets will be based on design speed and traffic volumes. 
Number of lanes will be determined based on traffic volumes, except for subdivision streets which will be typically two lanes only. 
Street categories based on the current Rockdale County/City of Conyers Functional Classification System. 
Typical section details are shown in the City of Conyers Standard Design and Construction Details. 
(c)  Right-of-way dedication. 
(1)  The minimum width of right-of-way shall be dedicated based upon the street classification, as provided in this section and approved by the Director. 
(2)  On any existing street abutting a proposed development, one-half of the required width of right-of-way shall be dedicated, at no cost to the City, as measured from the centerline of the roadway along the entire property frontage. Right-of-way widths for existing streets shall be based on the current classification as determined by the Director. 
(3)  Additional rights-of-way may be required at intersections or other locations fronting the property where turning lanes, storage lanes, medians, realignments or other traffic safety improvements are required. 
(4)  If a new street or thoroughfare is proposed by the City or the State to adjoin or traverse the property, the proposed road shall be accommodated into the development plans of the property in accordance with these subdivision regulations. These right-of-way requirements shall govern except where there exist clearly defined plans of the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) or the City that require additional right-of-way. In that case, the greater rights-of-way requirements shall govern. 
(d)  Clear zone requirements. All new roads/streets should utilize the concepts, designs, and philosophies in the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Roadside Design Guide, where practical and feasible to use the latest state-of-the-practice in roadside safety. New roads/streets should also use context-sensitive design concepts in the applications of clear zone. Context-sensitive design concepts are also on the GDOT web site (www.dot.state.ga.us). The application of clear zone concepts on existing roads/streets needs to be used where the greatest safety benefit can be realized. Crash reports, site investigations, and maintenance records offer starting points for identifying these locations. 
(e)  Guardrails. Georgia Department of Transportation approved guardrails are required on proposed roads that have insufficient clear zones or vehicular recovery zones. Guardrails may be required in areas with steep topography or stream crossings to provide vehicular and pedestrian safety benefits. 
(Code 1990, § 8-6-75; Ord. No. 757, 6-20-2007) 
Sec. 8-6-76. - Access management. 
(a)  Applicability. Except for development projects consisting of single-family dwelling units or industrial development, land subdivision and development that takes its primary access from a State or Federal highway or a thoroughfare classified as a collector, principal arterial or minor arterial in the latest Rockdale County/City of Conyers Functional Classification System shall comply with these standards. These standards shall apply unless a more restrictive standard is required by the GDOT. 
(b)  Joint and cross access. 
(1)  Adjacent commercial or office properties on collector, principal arterial or minor arterials shall provide a cross access drive and pedestrian access to allow circulation between sites. 
(2)  Joint driveways and cross access easements shall be established for multi-parcel commercial, office or industrial development, wherever feasible, along collector, principal arterial or minor arterial corridors. The building site shall incorporate the following: 
a.  Continuous service drives or cross access corridor connecting adjacent parcels along the thoroughfare; 
b.  A design speed of 15 miles per hour and a two-way travel aisle width of 24 feet to accommodate automobiles, service vehicles and loading vehicles; and 
c.  Driveway aprons, stub-outs and other design features to allow abutting properties to be connected and provide cross access via a service drive. 
(3)  The Director may reduce the required separation distance of access points where they prove impractical, provided all of the following requirements are met: 
a.  Joint access driveways and cross access easements are provided wherever feasible in accordance with this section. 
b.  The site plan incorporates a unified access and circulation system for vehicles and pedestrians in accordance with this section. 
(c)  Minimum driveway setbacks from street intersections.

(2)  Minimum standards. No driveway access shall be allowed within 150 feet of the centerline of an intersecting major collector or arterial street, or within 100 feet of any minor collector street. The Director may reduce these required distances where they prove impractical due to lot frontages of less than 100 feet. 
(d)  Minimum access requirements. 
(1)  All developments shall have one or more driveways or entrances to a public right-of-way. 
(2)  The number of such access points shall be as shown in table of minimum number of access points as follows: 

 
(e)  Separation of access points. 
(1)  Subdivisions located along existing City roads shall be required to provide reverse frontage lots or parallel frontage roads where feasible. All other lots must comply with the following: 
a.  Along State or Federal highways, no more than one point of vehicular access from a property shall be permitted for each 300 feet of lot frontage, or fraction thereof, although requirements of the GDOT shall apply whenever more restrictive. 
b.  Along arterial or collector roads other than State or Federal highways, no more than two points of vehicular access from a property to each abutting public street shall be permitted for each 300 feet of lot frontage, or fraction thereof; provided, however, that lots with less than 200 feet of frontage shall have no more than one point of access to any one public street. The Director shall determine whether the points of access may be unrestricted or will have to be designed for right-in, right-out traffic flow. To make this determination the Director may require a traffic study to be performed by the owner. 
(2)  No point of access shall be allowed within 35 feet of the right-of-way line of any street intersections for single-family and two-family residential lots and within 50 feet for multifamily and nonresidential properties. 
(3)  Corner lot access shall be located as far from the intersection as reasonably possible to reduce turning movement conflicts and to promote proper traffic circulation. 
(4)  The separation of access points on any street or road shall be determined by the established speed limit of the street or road, with the following minimum spacing requirements as provided in table of minimum driveway spacing as follows: 

 
*The Director may reduce the minimum spacing when the required distance is impractical due to lot frontages of less than 125 feet. 
(5)  The distance between access points shall be measured from the centerline of the proposed driveway to the centerline of the nearest adjacent driveway or roadway. 
(6)  Driveways shall be located so that the radius return is a minimum of four feet from a property line that intersects the right-of-way line.

(f)  Emergency access. All public streets, private and residential drives shall be designed and maintained so as to provide safe and convenient access for emergency vehicles, as required by the Rockdale County Fire Marshal. New developments with restricted access, such as gated subdivisions, must receive a variance from this requirement based on review and approval of the City Police Department. 
(Code 1990, § 8-6-76; Ord. No. 757, 6-20-2007) 
Sec. 8-6-77. - Driveway design standards. 
(a)  Permits required. No driveway shall be constructed abutting a City-maintained road or street until all applicable driveway permits have been approved and issued by the Department. For driveways that abut a state or Federal highway, all applicable permits shall be obtained from the GDOT prior to construction. 
(b)  General requirements. See also Section 8-6-76. 
(1)  Joint access driveways are permitted in order to achieve minimum driveway spacing requirements. 
(2)  No property may have a curb cut in excess of 50 feet in width without approval of the Director. 
(3)  If a nonresidential driveway design is one-way in or one-way out, then the driveway shall be a minimum width of 16 feet and shall have appropriate signage designating the driveway as a one-way connection.

(4)  Driveways shall be no closer than ten feet from a street tree or fire hydrant. 
(5)  Water and sewer lines shall be located outside of driveways, except for generally perpendicular crossings. 
(6)  Commercial driveways shall provide a 35-foot minimum radius at intersection with a public street. If designed for tractor-trailer trucks, the minimum radius shall be 75 feet. 
(d)  Auxiliary lanes. 
(1)  Along any arterial or major collector street, a deceleration lane, acceleration lane, left turn lane, larger turning radius, traffic islands or other devices or designs may be required to avoid specific traffic hazards that, otherwise, would be created by the proposed driveway location. 
(2)  Deceleration lanes shall be required by the City at each access point on roads classified as arterials or collectors when the posted speed limit is 30 miles per hour or higher and otherwise where considered necessary by the Director based on traffic volumes. Deceleration lanes are required on City roads classified as arterial and major collector streets when the posted speed limit is 30 miles per hour or higher. Minimum deceleration lengths are specified in the table of deceleration lane requirements. The Director may vary length requirements based upon a consideration of available sight distance and traffic volumes. 

 
(3)  When a new deceleration lane required by this section is proposed to begin or end within 50 feet of an existing deceleration lane, driveway or street intersection, then the new deceleration lane shall be extended as needed to provide a safe, continuous connection with adjacent or nearby deceleration lanes, driveways and intersections. 
(e)  Sight distance. All roads, streets, and driveways shall provide adequate sight distance as shown in the table of intersection sight distance requirements. See also City Standard Design and Construction Details.

The specific vertical and horizontal alignment of the proposed roadway shall be as established or approved by the City and/or the State, as applicable. 
(c)  Substandard streets. 
(1)  If a substandard street (dirt or gravel road or inadequate width of pavement or right-of-way) provides a means of access to a major subdivision or nonresidential development, the street shall be upgraded to the street classification standard required by the Rockdale County/City of Conyers Functional Classification System and in accordance with this article. These improvements shall extend from the entrance of the development to the nearest standard paved road of an equivalent or higher classification, along the route of primary access. 
(2)  All rights-of-way required for these off-site improvements shall be acquired at the expense of the developer. Additional requirements may be mandated by the City as outlined in Subsection (b) of this section. 
(d)  Improvements along State highways. For any development that abuts a state or Federal highway, improvements to the roadway and the location and design of any street or driveway providing access from the State highway shall comply with the standards and requirements of the GDOT and this article. A permit for the proposed access or improvements shall be required to have been approved by the GDOT and incorporated into the construction drawings for the project prior to issuance of a development permit by the Department. 
(e)  Permanent dead-end streets. See Section 8-6-12(b). 
(1)  New streets shall connect at both ends to existing streets unless the Director determines that unique parcel configuration or terrain make a fully connected street pattern infeasible or unsafe. 
(2)  When necessary, streets designed to have one end permanently closed shall provide a cul-de-sac turnaround and may be no more than 800 feet in length, unless otherwise approved by the Director. 
(3)  The length of a cul-de-sac street shall be measured from the center of the cul-de-sac to the center of the intersection with another street. 
(4)  Cul-de-sacs shall conform to design requirements of the City Standard Design and Construction Details. 
(f)  Temporary dead-end streets. 
(1)  A temporary dead-end street shall be provided to the boundary of a subdivision to provide access to abutting property for planned continuity of future circulation, improved access for public safety vehicles or for the extension of public water or other utilities to neighboring properties. Such dead-end streets shall be designed to meet the requirements of this article and to allow their reasonable extension and shall be located so as to be reasonably incorporated into a street design for the neighboring property. A temporary vehicular turnaround shall be provided as shown in the standard details. 
(2)  Existing dead-end streets on abutting property shall be extended into a proposed subdivision and incorporated into the street design of the development. 
(3)  Subsections (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section may be modified by the Director in cases of serious topographical hardship or unacceptable land use conflicts between the two developments. This modification may be conditioned on the provision of easements necessary for the extension of public utilities, the provision of a cul-de-sac or other permanent turnaround on the dead-end street or the removal of the dead-end street back to its nearest intersection. 
(4)  Where a dead-end street (other than a cul-de-sac) serves four or more lots in a multi-phase subdivision and such street is to be extended later, the developer shall be required to provide a temporary vehicular turnaround complying with Section 8-6-75(b). This requirement may be waived if extension of the dead-end street is approved and under construction prior to its inclusion in a final plat. 
(g)  Access roads. Where a development borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, major utility easement, limited access highway right-of-way or a major thoroughfare; a public street may be required to be constructed and dedicated within the development approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way. Locations of such service roads shall be aligned with similar service roads on adjacent properties. 
(h)  Construction access drives are required for vehicles with gross weight of 10,000 pounds or more. 
(1)  On multi-phase developments, the developer shall be required to dedicate, install, maintain and remove temporary construction access drives for the ingress and egress of construction vehicles, personnel and equipment. 
(2)  Temporary construction access drives shall be shown on the concept plan and preliminary plat and shall access an existing City road where possible. Construction access drives shall be permitted through the Department, and shall comply with sight distance requirements in Section 8-6-77(e). 
(3)  Temporary construction access drives shall be utilized as the sole means of ingress and egress during the construction of subsequent phases of the development, to prevent the flow of construction and heavy vehicular traffic on newly constructed streets completed under earlier phases. 
(4)  If the Director determines that a temporary construction access drive cannot be provided, due to site-specific restrictions, then the developer shall provide a maintenance bond for those portions of the newly constructed roadway utilized for construction access. The maintenance bond shall provide surety for roadway repairs and resurfacing. The required bond amount per linear foot shall be the current amount established by the City Council. The maintenance bond shall be provided to the City prior to the start of construction, and shall not expire for a period of 24 months following the completion of all construction activities. 
(i)  Half streets. Both the construction of new half streets and the extension of access to existing half streets shall be prohibited. Whenever a street is planned adjacent to the proposed subdivision tract boundary, the entire street right-of-way shall be platted within the proposed subdivision. 
(j)  Reserve strips. Land in private ownership adjacent to public rights-of-way, which could control or is intended to control access to streets, alleys or public lands, shall not be permitted unless control is given to the City under ownership, dedication or easement conditions approved by the City Attorney or acceptable to the Director. No development shall be designed so as to deny access to abutting properties. 
(k)  Alleys. Alleys are to be constructed to the following standards: 
(1)  Minimum width of right-of-way or easement: 20 feet; 
(2)  Minimum 14-foot wide paved travel lane;

(7)  Maximum grade of eight percent; 
(8)  Paving and base must be constructed to standards of public streets; 
(9)  Alleys shall be signed, "Fire Lanes - No Parking." 
(l)  Street jogs. 
(1)  Local streets shall either directly align or have offsets of a minimum of 125 feet for residential subdivision streets and a minimum of 200 feet for nonresidential subdivision streets, as measured between the centerlines. 
(2)  Where it is not feasible to align new streets or entrances with an existing street intersecting nearby on the opposite side of a collector or arterial street, then the new street intersection shall be no less than 600 feet from the intersection of the existing street, as measured between centerlines of the two opposing streets. 
(m)  Traffic-calming measures. Street layout and configuration should include a series of relatively short interconnected roadways in lieu of longer straight roads, to discourage excessive speeds. Additional traffic-calming measures may be required by the Director. Any specific measures employed shall be approved by the Director. See Section 8-6-85. 
(Code 1990, § 8-6-78; Ord. No. 757, 6-20-2007) 
Sec. 8-6-79. - Street intersections. 
(a)  Angle of intersections. Intersections of two public streets shall form an angle that is between 85 and 95 degrees, unless otherwise approved by the Director. If the intersection is signalized, the angle of the intersection may be reduced subject to the review and approval of the Director. 
(b)  Intersection approaches. 
(1)  The approaching street at any intersection shall be designed and constructed to provide both the minimum horizontal and vertical approach distances, as defined in this section and indicated in the table below. 
(2)  Minimum horizontal approach distance is defined as the minimum distance required along the centerline of an approaching street, perpendicular or no less than 85 degrees to the intersected street, as measured from the edge of pavement of the intersected street to the point of horizontal curvature on the approaching street. 
(3)  Minimum vertical approach distance is defined as the minimum distance required along the centerline of the approaching street, at a grade less than or equal to the recommended grade indicated in the table of intersection approach distances, as measured from the edge of pavement of the intersected street to a point on the profile of the approaching street where grades exceed recommended values. 

 
;le=2; 1  Distance of the approach is measured from edge of pavement of the intersected street to the point of curvature in the approaching street. 
;le=2; 2  Recommended approach grades shall be considered as the maximum allowable grades, unless otherwise approved by the Director. No grade shall be less than 1½ percent. 
(c)  Crown taper. The typical crowned street cross-section shall be tapered over a distance of not less than 50 feet on the approaching street at all intersections, in order to connect flush with the line and grade of the edge of pavement on the intersected street. The cross-section taper shall be designed and constructed so as to provide for the adequate drainage of surface water from all portions of the travel surface and gutter. 
(d)  Intersection radii. Intersection radii for roadways measured at back of curb and for the right-of-way lines shall be as shown in the table of intersection radii. For intersecting streets of different classification, the larger radii shall be provided. Larger radii may be required for streets intersecting at angles less than 90 degrees. In all cases, adequate right-of-way shall be provided to maintain a minimum of 12 feet from back of curb to right-of-way line. Miters are acceptable. 

 
(e)  Islands. Islands in street intersections shall conform to the design requirements of the City Standard Design and Construction Details. In no case shall anything in an island extend more than three feet above the street grade within the right-of-way; except traffic regulatory devices, street trees and other infrastructure erected or approved by the City. No island shall be approved that contains less than 100 square feet. Irrigation or other private systems shall not be installed within public right-of-way. 
(f)  Intersection corner sight distance. 
(1)  Intersections shall be designed with adequate corner sight distance for each approaching street. Where necessary, back slopes shall be flattened and horizontal or vertical curves lengthened to provide the minimum required sight distance. 
(2)  The minimum corner sight distance from the approaching street shall be calculated using latest edition of AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets. 
(g)  Obstructing visibility at intersections. On all corner lots located at a street intersection, a clear sight zone shall be maintained at all times. The design and location of new intersections shall meet the standards of Section 8-6-77(e). 
(h)  Turning lanes at intersections. Both center left-turn and right-turn lanes shall be provided on all new internal project streets, and on all existing City roads, where traffic volumes and turning movements warrant the installation. At the request of the Director, the developer or applicant shall prepare and submit a detailed traffic study (as defined herein), outlining projected traffic volumes, turning movements and auxiliary lanes required. The methodology and conclusions presented in the traffic study are subject to the review and approval of the Director. 
(1)  Center turn lane storage. A minimum storage length of 150 feet shall be provided for center left turn lanes on any arterial streets. A minimum storage length of 100 feet shall be provided on all collector streets. Additional storage capacity shall be provided as required, based on projected peak traffic volumes and turning movements.

Sec. 8-6-80. - Geometric street design standards. 
(a)  AASHTO standards. All streets and roadways shall be designed in accordance with the AASHTO standards, as provided in A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, latest edition and any amendments thereto. All applicable signage, markings or other traffic control measures shall be designed in accordance with the Manual of Uniform Traffic Devices (MUTCD), latest edition and any amendments thereto. 
(b)  Horizontal curvature and super-elevation. All new streets shall adhere to the standards governing horizontal curvature and super-elevation in the table of horizontal curvature and super-elevations, unless otherwise specified by AASHTO standards: 

 
Note: Super-elevation not required for local streets. 
(c)  Tangents. Between reverse horizontal curves there shall not be less than the minimum centerline radii and tangents shown in the table of horizontal alignment and reverse curves, unless otherwise specified by AASHTO standards. Compound radii are prohibited. 

 
(d)  Vertical alignment. 
(1)  All changes in street profile grades having an algebraic difference greater than that shown the latest edition of the GDOT Design Manual shall be connected to a parabolic curve having a minimum length in feet (L), which is equal to the algebraic difference between the grades in percent (A) multiplied by the design constant (K) assigned to the street according to its classification and design speed (i.e., L = KA). 
(2)  (K) values shown in the table of constant (K) values for vertical alignments shall be utilized in all cases, and in no case shall the constant (K) value be less than the minimum permitted. 

 
(e)  Street centerline grades. 
(1)  Street or road grades exceeding ten percent for a minor collector and 12 percent for local streets are prohibited, unless otherwise approved by the Director. The Director may grant limited exceptions on maximum grades, based on conclusive evidence that shows a lesser grade is impractical due to topographic or site specific limitations.

(2)  Cut or fill slopes shall not exceed three horizontal units to one vertical unit, unless otherwise approved by the Director based on site-specific topographic and geotechnical conditions. Flatter slopes shall be provided, where possible, to better accommodate utility installation and maintenance activities. 
(3)  Erosion and sediment control best management practices (BMPs) shall be installed in accordance with the approved construction plans, prior to or concurrent with all land disturbing activities. Alternate or additional BMPs may be required by the City Inspector, if it is deemed that current measures do not provide adequate protection. 
(4)  All suitable material from roadway cuts may be used in the construction of fills, approaches or at other places as needed. Excess or unsuitable materials, including organics, soft clay, etc., shall be removed from within the right-of-way and for a distance not less than one foot on each side of the road surface for each vertical foot of unsuitable material at the right-of-way line. 
(5)  Fill material shall be placed in uniform horizontal layers or lifts, not to exceed a compacted thickness of more than six inches. Moisture content shall be adjusted as necessary to compact material to 95 percent of maximum dry density. The top 12 inches of sub-grade material under any roadway, drive or parking area shall be compacted to 98 percent of standard proctor density. 
(d)  Final grading and sub-grade preparation. 
(1)  Sub-grade brought up to grade. After rough grading, storm sewer and utility installation is complete and the backfill in all such ditches is thoroughly compacted, the sub-grade shall be brought to the lines, grades, and typical roadway section shown on the plans. 
(2)  All utility crossings shall be installed prior to sub-grade approval. If utility installation cannot be completed at this time, the developer shall coordinate the installation of casings or conduits to accommodate subsequent utility installation without disturbance to the sub-grade.

If a wall is to be located adjacent to a public road and within the required yard within a zoning district, the wall shall not exceed four feet in height and should not obstruct sight distance for motorists. Should a wall be erected in error within the right-of-way, the City shall not be responsible for replacing or repairing the nonconforming structure. 
(b)  When permanent grades are proposed with a resulting slope steeper than one foot vertical for every two feet of horizontal displacement (2:1), an appropriate retaining structure shall be designed by a registered professional engineer to be constructed of reinforced concrete or other masonry materials designed by a registered professional engineer in compliance with applicable regulations of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. An engineered design may be substituted for the reinforced concrete design, if the specific vendor has a pre-qualified acceptance from the Building Official. All structural components of the wall shall meet the minimum building codes for the proposed use. 
(c)  When the necessity for an earth retaining structure is required for a vertical displacement of 30 inches or less, appropriate landscaping timbers, or approval equal, may be employed if no permanent structure is supported by the soil retained by the retaining wall. The use of railroad cross ties or other timber product will be allowed only in these instances as per detail. 
(d)  All wall designs must demonstrate complete dimensions for line and grade. Wall design will consider foundation drainage and select backfill material for the proposed conditions. 
(e)  Walls shall be located in such a fashion as to not encroach upon existing or proposed drainage easements or drainage courses or floodplains to encumber the natural flow of surface runoff of stormwater. Walls shall be located at a distance from such watercourses to allow for anticipated future maintenance of the easement to prevent a safety hazard to maintenance workers or to jeopardize the structural integrity of the wall. 
(f)  Walls that are not attached to the permitted structure and require a foundation shall be permitted as a freestanding structure and shall be inspected, as prescribed by the permitting procedure. Walls will be inspected for conformance with the approved design. Any deviation from the approved design will require the engineer of record to submit a certification of the nonconforming structure along with supporting calculations to indicate that the construction is consistent with the initial design parameters. In the event the inspector has not been provided ample opportunity to inspect the structure, the contractor must provide a certification of the construction by the engineer of record and geotechnical reports for concrete testing for strength and reinforcing steel specifications. Failure to comply with the requirements of this section will require that the remaining work cease and/or removal of nonconformance until the adequacy of structural integrity is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director. 
(g)  Retaining walls that are proposed for the purpose of stormwater retention must be designed in such a way that the walls are capable of a hydrostatic load, as measured from the top of the foundation footing to the highest elevation along the top of the wall. The hydrological design must allow for a freeboard dimension of one foot and an emergency overflow capacity equal to the allowable peak discharge for the 100-year storm event. The routing calculations should not take into account the existence of the emergency overflow. Place the overflow device above the projected 100-year flood elevation within the detention area. 
(h)  Any construction that may impact or be within the right-of-way of an existing or proposed water or sanitary sewer easement must be approved by the utility providing service.

(a)  Where a standard or regulation in this chapter specifically authorizes discretionary review or relief by the Director, such standard or regulation may be varied or modified, but not waived, by the Director subject to the following procedures: 
(1)  At the time that the preliminary plat is filed, the developer or applicant may request such relief or variance in writing, using a form provided by the Department. The request shall cite the specific code section and text of the provision, along with the reasons for the request. Such reasons shall address each of the findings that are provided below in Subsection (a)(2) of this section. 
(2)  The Director may, within ten working days of receiving such request, vary a standard or regulation as specified in Subsection (a) of this section, based on a written report that makes all of the following findings with respect to the request of the applicant: 
a.  Extraordinary hardships or practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with the cited standard or regulation. 
b.  In this specific instance, the purpose and intent of the cited standard or regulation may be adequately served by a modification or variance of the standard or regulation. 
c.  The form of relief to be granted to the applicant is the least amount of reduction or least degree of modification of the cited standard or regulation that would result in substantial justice for the applicant while securing the public interest in this specific case. 
d.  The granting of the variance or modification in this case will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare or injurious to other property. 
e.  The conditions upon which the request is based are unique to the property for which the relief is sought and are not applicable generally to other property. 
f.  Because of the particular surroundings, shape, topographical or geological conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the specified standard or regulation were to be strictly enforced in this case. 
g.  The alleged hardship is not self-imposed by the applicant by his or her previous actions that might otherwise have reasonably avoided the alleged hardship. 
h.  The granting of relief in this case will not set an unintended precedent that will result in undermining the purpose and intent of a valid standard or regulation. 
(3)  Based on the findings with respect to each of the foregoing standards of relief, the Director may take any one of the following actions: 
a.  Deny the request made by the applicant; 
b.  Approve the request made by the applicant; 
c.  Approve the request made by the applicant with conditions that will, in the Director's judgment, satisfy the standards described above in Subsection (a)(2) of this section; or 
d.  Grant a variance or modification that differs from the exact extent of the relief sought, provided that, in the Director's professional opinion, the variance or modification that is granted is more consistent with the findings made in Subsection (a)(2) of this section than the original request of the applicant would be. 
(4)  The decision of the Director shall be recorded in writing, along with the findings with respect to each of the standards in Subsection (a)(2) of this section, along with other related comments and grounds for such decision. 
(b)  Once per year, but not later than January 31, the Director shall file a report with the City Council summarizing the actions taken by the Director on requests for variances and modifications to the requirements of this chapter during the previous calendar year. Such report shall include an assessment by the Director as to whether such actions during the previous year or in recent years past, constitute grounds for amending the provisions of this chapter. 
(c)  Appeals. Any person aggrieved by any decision, final order, requirement, determination or interpretation made by the Director with respect to the provision of this Section 8-6-138 may initiate an appeal to the City Board of Zoning Appeals and Adjustments pursuant to the requirements of Chapter 7 of this title.

It is further the purpose of this district to introduce urban planning techniques that will repair and transform the autocentric patterns of suburbia that produced banal housing subdivisions, big box stores and a proliferation of parking areas into a complete community that is sustainable and more than capable of accommodating a diversity of income levels, building types, modes of transportation and open space. To this end, and as expressed in the Comprehensive Land Use Plan, this district seeks to enable, encourage and implement land development patterns that will purposefully integrate dwellings with open space, offices, schools and stores, resulting in the manifestation of a distinct and visually harmonious community of choice that is wholesome, sustainable and healthy. 
(b)  Intent. The intent of this district is to create and to preserve a visually harmonious and orderly community that is compact, mixed-use and pedestrian friendly wherein: 
(1)  An interconnected network of streets disperse traffic and reduce the length of automobile trips, while encouraging walking and bicycling as healthy and sustainable forms of transportation and recreation; 
(2)  A diversity of uses enable a variety of economic, recreational, retail and residential activity; 
(3)  The ordinary activities of daily living occurs within walking and bicycling distance of most dwellings, allowing independence to those who do not drive, while expanding the transportation options that are available to those who do drive; 
(4)  A range of housing types and price levels accommodate diverse ages and incomes; 
(5)  A range of open space accommodate various community recreational purposes; and 
(6)  Architecture and landscape designs grow from local topography, history, climate and building technique. 
(c)  Definitions. This paragraph provides definitions for terms in this section that are either technical in nature, or that may not reflect common usage of the term. If a term is not defined in this paragraph, then it shall be as defined in Section 8-7-15, definitions.

2.  When an addition or renovation of an existing building or use increases the extent of a building or use by more than 50 percent, the entire building or use shall meet parking and loading requirements of this chapter; unless a special exception or administrative variance is granted in accordance with Section 8-7-130. 
3.  No addition to an existing building shall reduce the number of spaces or usability of an existing parking or loading area unless it conforms to this chapter. 
(3)  Parking in Central Business District. 
a.  Off-street parking and loading requirements are waived in the D District except as provided in accordance with Section 8-7-41(j)(7). 
b.  No parking areas may be used for the sale, repair, dismantling, servicing or long-term storage of any vehicles or equipment, unless permitted by the zoning district in which the area is located. 
(b)  Parking space requirements. 
(1)  Minimum parking space requirements. The minimum number of parking space shall be determined from Table 3, unless the development qualifies for a reduction in minimum parking requirements as provided in Subsection (c) of this section. 
(2)  Maximum parking requirements. 
a.  Maximum parking requirements are established in order to promote efficient use of land, enhance urban form, encourage alternate modes of transportation, provide for better pedestrian movement, reduce the amount of impervious surface and to protect air and water quality. 
b.  The maximum number of parking spaces allowed is 125 percent of the number shown in Table 3. 
c.  For any surface parking lot that provides more than 105 percent of the minimum required number of spaces, the number of parking spaces that are in excess of the minimum shall be placed on pervious paving surfaces approved by the City Manager, or his or her designee. 

 
(c)  Reduction in minimum parking requirements. 
(1)  Special exception for shared parking or on-street parking. 
(2)  Shared parking and on-street parking reduce the impervious surface of parking areas and encourages pedestrian access. Therefore, the City Manager, or his or her designee, may grant a special exception to allow minimum parking requirements to be provided through on-street parking or by shared parking, provided that the required number of parking spaces can be located within a 600-foot radius of the property of the principal use for which the parking is required. 
(3)  Shared parking may be permitted by the City Manager or his or her designee if the applicant satisfactorily demonstrates that the actual peak parking requirements of the proposed development or use can be satisfied with a lesser number of parking spaces through sharing adjacent parking for two or more proximate uses because peak demand periods for proposed land uses do not occur at the same time periods. 
(4)  Developers requesting reductions based on shared parking shall submit the following: 
a.  Site plan indicating the location of uses proposing to share parking requirements and design of shared parking facilities; 
b.  Names and addresses of the owners and uses that share parking; 
c.  Location and number of parking shared spaces; 
d.  A cross-access legal agreement between owners to ensure the continued availability of adequate parking; 
e.  A shared parking analysis that shall follow the procedures detailed in the subsection below. 
(5)  The procedures for determining parking requirements in a mixed-use development are: 
a.  Determine the minimum amount of parking required for each separate use in Table 3; 
b.  Multiply the parking requirement for each use by the corresponding percentage for each of the time periods in Table 4; 
c.  Sum the total parking requirements for all uses for each of the five time periods in Table 4; 
d.  The parking requirement for the time period having the largest required total number of parking spaces based on use of Table 4 shall be the minimum required number of parking spaces for the mixed-use development. 

 
(6)  Any subsequent change in land uses within the participating developments shall require proof that adequate parking will be available. Prior to any change in ownership or use, the owner must apply to the City Manager or his or her designee for an evaluation and confirmation of the reduction. If the City Manager or his or her designee finds that the parking reduction is no longer justified, the City Manager or his or her designee shall notify the owner to construct the number of parking spaces necessary to meet the required level. 
(7)  On-street parking. Up to 50 percent of the on-street parking spaces available within 600 feet of a use may be counted towards the minimum off-street parking requirements, provided that the same parking space cannot be used by more than two parcels. 
(d)  Administrative variance. The City Manager or his or her designee shall have the authority to grant a reduction in the total number of off-street parking spaces by up to 50 percent of the number required by Table 3 through administrative variance. Such administrative variance requires review and approval of the applicant's written documentation and justification that one or more of the following conditions exist: 
(1)  Because of unique circumstances including the shape, topography, soils and vegetation of the site, the provision of the minimum number of required spaces would cause the applicant to suffer unique and undue hardship. 
(2)  The site is located in an environmentally sensitive area, such as a water supply watershed, where stormwater runoff should be minimized. 
(3)  The unique circumstances of the use make the minimum number of parking spaces excessive for actual needs. 
(e)  Parking structures. 
(1)  Parking structures are allowed in the O-I, D, BG, MxD, and HSB Zoning Districts. 
(2)  Where off-street parking spaces are provided in parking structures, a bonus floor area of 350 square feet (gross floor area of building) shall be allowed for each parking space in the parking structure.

(Code 1990, § 8-7-94; Ord. No. 693, 8-18-2004; Ord. No. 889, § 1, 10-17-2012; Ord. No. 943, § 1, 11-20-2013) 
Sec. 8-7-95. - Landscaping and buffering. 
(a)  General requirements. A planted buffer strip is required to protect residential land uses from excessive heat, dust, wind, light, unsightly views, odors and other characteristics commonly associated with commercial and industrial land uses and related vehicular and pedestrian traffic, which can adversely impact the quality of residential life. The required buffer shall provide necessary visual and acoustical privacy for the conduct of residential lifestyles in an undisturbed environment and shall provide for the protection and preservation of property values in residential districts. 
Required buffers shall be established and maintained by the developer and owner of the incompatible (less restrictive) land use. The required buffer must: 
(1)  Be depicted in detail (the type and locations of natural and planted vegetation are to be illustrated) on each site plan or plan prior to approval and shall be designated as a permanent easement; 
(2)  Not be disturbed by grading, property improvements or construction activities; except where necessary to prevent a nuisance, or to thin such natural growth where too dense to permit normal growth, or to remove diseased, misshapen, or dangerous and decayed timbers. Any contemplated disturbance first shall be brought to the attention of the Director and formal approval secured prior to initiating activity within the required buffer area; 
(3)  Utilize existing vegetation where it has been determined that existing vegetation is appropriate for inclusion within the buffer strip or when required to be supplemented with approved, additional plantings; 
(4)  Retain the natural topography of the land, except when a portion must be cleared and graded as required by the local law to prevent soil erosion or sedimentation; 
(5)  Be completely installed in accordance with the approved plan prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy; 
(6)  Not be used for temporary or permanent parking or loading, other than for provision of drainage improvements as mandated by the local law or for a structure other than a fence; 
(7)  Attain a height of not less than six feet within three years of the planting date. 
(b)  Buffer required. It is recognized that the location of multifamily residential, commercial or industrial zoning districts directly adjacent to single-family residential districts can create an incompatible situation. Additionally, the location of multifamily residential districts or manufactured home parks directly adjacent to single-family residential zoning districts can be an incompatible situation. Accordingly, in multifamily residential, commercial and industrial districts, when a principal structure is constructed, expanded or modified, a planted screening buffer shall be provided and maintained along all side and rear property lines contiguous with a single-family residential district. The City Council requires a similar buffer strip between other districts and land uses deemed to be incompatible, as indicated in Table 9. 
It is recognized that the location of single-family residential uses accessed directly from collector or arterial roads can create safety issues. Accordingly, in single-family residential districts, when a new subdivision is built where a public street is adjacent to the rear property line of single-family residential lots, a screened buffer area including, but not limited to, solid fences or masonry walls shall be provided and maintained to create a barrier between the public road and the rear yards. This shall include a ten-foot planted strip in a no access easement. Such buffer, however, shall not obstruct traffic visibility. The City Council may require a similar buffer between other districts and public roads for safety purposes. 
(c)  Minimum buffer specifications. As different types of land uses generate varying degrees of incompatibility, it follows that variable widths for a buffer are appropriate. Therefore, the amount and type of planting required to accomplish adequate screening and insulation shall be variable, and in each instance shall be determined by the intensity and extent of the use judged incompatible. Table 9 provides the minimum specifications for buffer widths to be used by the Planning Commission and City Council. 
In other instances, where an incompatible situation is determined, the width of the buffer shall be recommended by the Planning Commission but shall not be less than 15 feet. The required buffer shall be in addition to the minimum yard area, as specified in the appropriate zoning district. 

 
*Buffer widths may be reduced by 20 feet by the addition of a solid, opaque fence or wall at least six feet in height. 
(d)  Composition of buffer. In those instances where it is clearly obvious that existing natural vegetation and topography could not possibly achieve the desired level of screening as determined by this chapter, a planted buffer shall be provided and shall consist of plant material of such growth characteristics as will provide an acoustical and visual screen of planting. Plant materials for buffers shall be in accordance with the tree preservation and landscape zoning ordinance. 
Other evergreen plant materials having the same growth characteristics as the aforementioned may be substituted, subject to approval by the City Manager, or his or her designee, prior to installation. 
(e)  Maintenance. The screening buffer planting and any required landscaped open space planting shall be guaranteed for the life of the commercial, industrial or residential development. Necessary trimming and maintenance shall be performed by the installing property owner to maintain the health of the plant materials, to provide aesthetically pleasing appearance and to ensure that the buffer actually serves the purpose for which it is intended. 
(f)  Other screening requirements. Certain uses such as junk or salvage yard operations and other commercial and industrial operations requiring the storage of inoperative equipment, vehicles and other types of bulk storage for prolonged periods of time could present unsightly views or health hazards. To preclude this from occurring, the Director shall require owners of such properties to completely enclose such operations by a fence or wall that completely obscures views of the property from adjacent sidewalks, streets and other properties built to a height greater than that of the height of the highest piece of equipment or vehicle and types of bulk storage stored on the property. Such fences shall be constructed of masonry, wood or combination thereof or other materials approved by the City. Construction of cyclone fencing that utilizes metal inserts as screening shall be prohibited.

Sec. 8-7-96. - Nonconforming uses and structures. 
(a)  General rules. 
(1)  Within the zoning districts established by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted, there might exist land, structures and uses of land and structures in combination that were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but that would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendment. It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, extended or used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
(2)  Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this chapter. 
(3)  To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption of this chapter. All duly authorized nonconforming projects, on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits, so long as these permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired. If a development is designed to be completed in phases, this shall apply only to the particular phase or phases that received approval prior to enactment of this chapter. 
(b)  Nonconforming lots of record. 
(1)  In any district, a building may be erected on any single undeveloped lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lots fail to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district; provided that yard dimensions and requirements, other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lots shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. 
(2)  If two or more undeveloped lots or combinations of undeveloped lots and portions of undeveloped lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the land involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this chapter; and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner that diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this chapter, and no division of any parcel shall be made that creates a lot width or area less than the requirements stated in this chapter. 
(c)  Extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations. 
(1)  Except as specifically provided herein, no person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation. In particular, physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such activity results in: 
a.  An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use; 
b.  Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements, height limitations or density requirements or other requirements. 
(2)  Subject to other provisions of this section, a nonconforming use may be extended throughout the portion of a completed building that, when the use was made nonconforming by this chapter, was designed or arranged to accommodate such use. However, a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside of the original building. 
(3)  Subject to other provisions of this section, a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming. 
(4)  Any change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists that would normally require a rezoning shall require removal of the nonconforming situation. 
(d)  Repair, maintenance and reconstruction. 
(1)  Minor improvements and additions that are made to single-family residences previously built in a subdivision of record zoned R-A, RS-20 or RS-14 with a final plat approved prior to enactment of this chapter shall not be subject to the provisions of this section, provided that such minor improvements and additions are limited to the following actions: 
a.  Additions of heated floor area less than 50 percent of the existing floor area. 
b.  Construction of an accessory structure or garage not to exceed 500 square feet in floor area. 
c.  Improvements to outdoor space, such as swimming pools, courts for basketball, tennis or handball, gazebos, trellises, patios, decks, balconies, and similar nonoccupied structures. 
(2)  If a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to an extent that the costs of repair or replacement would exceed 50 percent of the appraised valuation of the damaged structure, then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only in a conforming manner. 
(3)  If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful as a result of lack of repairs and maintenance and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unlawful by reasons of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(4)  Nonconformity compliance certificate. A nonconformity compliance certificate is required before issuance of a land disturbance permit or a building permit affecting a nonconforming use, lot, or structure. See Section 8-7-121. 
(e)  Replacement of nonconforming manufactured homes. All mobile homes shall be located within mobile home parks, except that nonconforming mobile homes legally existing May 6, 1964, may remain under the following conditions: 
(1)  If any nonconforming home is moved, it cannot be relocated within the City or replaced by another mobile home except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, provided that a nonconforming home may be moved on its present site to more nearly comply with the applicable yard requirements of Article B of this chapter. 
(2)  If any nonconforming home is destroyed, it cannot be rebuilt or replaced except in conformity with the terms of this chapter. 
(3)  A nonconforming manufactured home cannot be expanded in size and no additions or structural alterations or changes in foundation can be made thereto, unless the nonconforming home is made to conform to the provisions of this chapter. 
(4)  Nothing in the above subsections of this section shall be construed or interpreted to prevent the normal maintenance and repair of any mobile home. 
(f)  Discontinuance of nonconforming situations. 
(1)  When a nonconforming use is discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days or discontinued for any period of time without a definite intention to reinstate the nonconforming use, the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes. 
(2)  When a structure or operation made nonconforming by this chapter is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the 180-day period for purposes of this article begins on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived.

(3)  If the applicant does not know specific future tower and antenna site locations but does know of areas where telecommunications facilities will be needed within the next five years to provide service, then the applicant shall list the land lots contained within the anticipated geographic service area and shall identify each geographic service area with a number that will correspond to the future telecommunication facility site. 
(j)  Applicants for towers must identify all existing towers and major structures potentially capable of supporting telecommunication equipment, and all towers for which there are applications currently on file with the Department that are located within the applicant's search area. This shall include a description of the distance and location of all such tower and structure sites, both within and outside the applicant's network. Evidence shall be submitted that demonstrates that no existing or pending tower or major structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. The evidence shall contain an analysis of the following: 
(1)  No such towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements; 
(2)  Such towers or structures are not of sufficient telecommunications facility height to meet applicant's engineering requirements and cannot be adequately modified; 
(3)  Such towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment and cannot be adequately modified; 
(4)  Such towers, structures and existing tower sites lack space to locate the proposed antenna or to construct a tower for the proposed antenna; 
(5)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on such towers or structures, or the antenna on such towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna; and 
(6)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other factors that render such towers and structures unusable; 
(7)  If the evidence demonstrates co-location is feasible and if co-location on any such towers or structure would result in less visual impact than the visual impact of the proposed tower, then applicant shall justify why such co-location is not being proposed. If co-location on any such tower or structure would increase negative visual impact, then the applicant must so state and demonstrate. Requests by the applicant to co-locate on existing towers and structures shall be in writing and said written requests as well as written denials of same are required and shall be included in the application materials. The City will review with special care any justifications that rely upon undue expense and/or difficulties in entering into a lease agreement. The City shall carefully weigh such claims, and the evidence presented in favor of them, against a project's negative impacts at the proposed site and on the surrounding area. 
(k)  If the proposed site is zoned RA, RS-14, RS-20, TND, TH, RM, or MxD, then an applicant for a tower shall provide evidence as to why alternate sites in the BN, BG, O-I, D, HSB, or ID Zoning Districts have not been proposed. If requests by the applicant to utilize said alternate sites have been denied, said denials shall be in writing and included in the application materials. 
(l)  In all zoning districts, applicants shall provide evidence demonstrating that they cannot provide adequate personal wireless communication service consistent with the requirements of their Federal license without the use of a telecommunications facility at the specific location requested. 
(m)  An applicant for a tower shall provide evidence establishing that the proposed tower constitutes the least intrusive means necessary to close significant service gaps or otherwise provide coverage mandated by the terms of their Federal license. Statements shall be provided demonstrating that all alternatives have been investigated by the applicant, including alternative tower design, alternative technology, multiple smaller sized, less-intrusive towers, alternative locations, co-location opportunities for placement upon existing structures or buildings, and similar alternatives. 
(n)  The applicant shall provide any other evidence necessary to establish compliance with each of the criteria set forth in this section. 
(o)  The applicant shall provide any other information requested by the Department needed to fully evaluate the potential impact of the proposed facility in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section. 
(Code 1990, § 8-7-101; Ord. No. 791, § 3, 6-17-2009; Memo of 8-15-2016) 
Sec. 8-7-102. - Requirements for all telecommunications facilities. 
The following requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities: 
(a)  Multiple uses. The presence of existing uses or structures on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot provided said installation is otherwise in accordance with this article. For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including, but not limited to, setback requirements, lot coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antennas or towers may be located on leased parcels within such lots. 
(b)  Building codes and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of such a facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable City and State building and safety codes for telecommunications facilities, as may be amended from time to time. Towers shall be located in a manner such that all ice-fall or debris from the tower or alternative tower structure or guy wires will not fall outside the parcel under the ownership or control of the applicant and on which the tower is located. 
(c)  Regulatory compliance. All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the State or Federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed, to the extent required by any such regulations, then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this article shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations. 
(d)  Security. All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device(s) to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility. All towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height. 
(e)  Lighting. No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or Federal agency of competent jurisdiction. If lighting is required, it shall be to the minimum applicable standard and shall be shielded and/or designed so as to minimize disturbance to surrounding areas. 
(f)  Advertising. No signs shall be permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required to be posted by the FCC or FAA. Antennas added to existing structures containing signs shall not be construed as violations of this provision. 
(g)  Visual quality. 
(1)  Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable Federal or State agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
(2)  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
(3)  Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated into horizontal or vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging. 
(4)  The design of the buildings and related structures at a telecommunications facility site shall, to the maximum extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the telecommunication facilities to the existing natural setting and built environment. 
(5)  Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be either below grade or screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained. 
(h)  Landscaping. 
(1)  Landscaping shall be provided that effectively screens the view of the equipment shelters or cabinets from adjacent uses to a planted height of at least six feet and in a manner that effectively reduces visual obtrusiveness of the site. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscape strip at least ten feet wide outside the required fence. All landscaping shall be reviewed and approved by the City for compliance with all City landscaping and tree regulations prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy (CO). All landscaping shall be maintained for the duration of the facility by the owner of the telecommunication facility or property owner of record. 
(2)  Existing trees and vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest extent possible, and if they cannot be preserved then they must be replaced. For any trees and vegetation that must be removed, the applicant shall provide a landscaping plan showing which existing trees and vegetation will be removed, and the plan shall also indicate the location of the replacement trees and vegetation. 
(3)  In locations where the strict application of this landscaping requirement would not result in the minimization of visual impact, as determined by the Department, the Department may modify or waive this requirement in a manner that is at least equally protective of the visual impact of the tower on adjacent and surrounding properties. 
(i)  Accessory uses. Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed. However, such allowable use shall not include offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility. 
(j)  Setbacks. Telecommunications towers and antennas shall be set back a distance equal to the total height of the tower from any adjacent property line and all public rights-of-way, measured radially from the base of the tower to the highest point. In addition, all telecommunication facilities, including towers, guy wires and accessory facilities, shall meet the setback and other development standards specified for the applicable zoning district. Further, all telecommunication towers and antennas shall be set back from all on-site and off-site residential dwellings a distance equal to the tower height. 
(k)  Separation requirement. A telecommunication tower shall not be located closer than 1,500 feet from another telecommunication tower. 
(l)  Site integration. Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land uses. Towers and alternative tower structures shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site. 
(m)  Historic areas. Telecommunications facilities shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic properties or scenic view corridors identified by the City or any State or Federal law or agency. 
(n)  Co-location design. Any tower proposed for a height of between 80 and 100 feet shall be designed and intended to accommodate two users. Any tower proposed at a height greater than 100 feet and up to and including 150 feet shall be designed and intended to accommodate at least three users. Any tower proposed for a height of over 150 feet shall be designed and intended to accommodate at least four users. 
(o)  Removal requirements. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the City notifying the owner of such abandonment. 
(p)  Conditions. In granting administrative or special use permit authorization pursuant to this article, conditions may be imposed to minimize or ameliorate any negative impacts or effects of the proposed telecommunications facility on adjacent properties.

(a)  Uses permitted administratively. The following telecommunication facilities may be approved administratively by the Director of the Department following administrative review: 
(1)  Installing an antenna, including microcells and similar arrays, on an existing structure other than a tower, such as a nonresidential building, sign, light pole, water tower, or other freestanding nonresidential structure, in any district zoned O-I, BN, BG, HSB or ID so long as said additional antenna adds no more than 20 feet to the telecommunication facility height of said existing structure. For antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ratio (example: ten-foot high antenna and supporting structures requires a ten-foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement: 
(i)  Is shown to reduce the visual impact from surrounding areas; or 
(ii)  Is necessary to achieve the antenna's telecommunication purpose and is shown to equal or reduce the visual impact from surrounding areas. 
(2)  Alterations to existing telecommunications towers, alternative tower structure, or antennas, including addition of additional antennas, provided that such alteration does not result in an increase in the existing telecommunications tower or antenna height by more than 20 feet. The Director of the Department may relax or eliminate the application requirements set forth in Section 8-7-101 for alteration applications if the Director of the Department determines that said application requirements are not necessary to effectively evaluate the alteration application. 
(3)  Administrative approval for Subsection (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall be granted only upon a finding by the Director of the Department that: 
(A)  Compliance with Sections 8-7-101 and 8-7-102 and all other requirements of City codes, has been fully established; and 
(B)  The proposal is compatible with the land uses surrounding the site and will not create a demonstrated negative impact to any residential areas from which said proposal can be viewed. 
(b)  Uses permitted by special use permit. A special use permit shall be required for all telecommunications facilities not authorized administratively in Subsection (a) of this section. Said telecommunication facilities may be erected, installed, constructed, enlarged, moved, or converted only following approval of a special use permit by the City subject to the following regulations: 
(1)  Compliance with Section 8-7-126.

These appeals shall be taken by filing with the secretary of the Board of Zoning Appeals and Adjustments a notice of appeal, specifying the grounds thereof, within 15 days after the action being appealed was taken. A failure to act shall not be construed to be an order, requirement or decision within the meaning of this section. 
(2)  The Department shall transmit to the Board of Zoning Appeals and Adjustments all papers constituting the record upon which the action being appealed was taken. The notice of appeal shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee, as established from time to time by the City Council to defray the actual cost of processing the application. 
(3)  Appeal stays legal proceedings. An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action being appealed, unless the public official from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board of Zoning Appeals and Adjustments after notice of appeal has been filed that, by reasons of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in that official's opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such a case, proceedings shall be stayed only by a restraining order granted by the Superior Court of the County on notice to the public official from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown. 
(b)  Compliance with standards upon denial. If an application for an appeal, variance or special exception is initiated to seek relief from an existing violation of this chapter, and the application is denied, the violation shall be required to be corrected within 15 days of the denial unless a greater amount of time is allowed by the Board of Zoning Appeals and Adjustments. The maximum extension of time the Board of Zoning Appeals and Adjustments may grant for correction shall not exceed 90 days. 
(c)  Public hearings. 
(1)  The Board of Zoning Appeals and Adjustments shall hear the appeal and matters referred to it within 45 days of receiving the complete and sufficient application for appeal and give notice to the appellant and official(s) subject to the appeal. The Secretary shall issue proper public notification of the public hearing. The public notification shall indicate the place, date and time of the hearings and shall be posted and advertised, per O.C.G.A. § 55-14-1, the Georgia Open Meetings Act. Any party may appear at the hearing in person, by an agent, by an attorney or by written documentation. 
(2)  It is the duty of the Board of Zoning Appeals and Adjustments to review such facts and evidence in light of the intent of the chapter to balance the public health, safety and general welfare against the injury to a specific applicant that would result from the strict application of the provisions of the ordinance on the applicant's property. 
(d)  Decisions of the Board. Following the consideration of all testimony, documentary evidence and matters of record, the Board of Zoning Appeals and Adjustments shall make a determination on each appeal. The Board of Zoning Appeals and Adjustments shall decide the appeal within a reasonable time but, in no event, more than 60 days from the date of the initial hearing. An appeal may be sustained only upon an expressed finding by the Board of Zoning Appeals and Adjustments that the public official's action was based on an erroneous finding of a material fact or that the public official acted in an arbitrary manner.

(1)  The Board of Zoning Appeals and Adjustments shall not grant a variance unless it shall, in each case, make specific findings of fact based directly upon the particular evidence presented supporting written conclusions that the variance: 
a.  Arises from a condition that is unique and peculiar to the land, structures and buildings involved;

c.  The condition requiring the requested relief is not ordinarily found in properties of the same zoning district as the subject property; 
d.  The condition is created by the regulations of this chapter and not by an action or actions of the property owner or the applicant; 
e.  The granting of the variance will not impair or injure other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the subject property is located; nor impair an adequate supply of light or air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, increase the danger of fire, create a hazard to air navigation, endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood; 
f.  The variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structures; 
g.  The variance desired will not be opposed to the general spirit and intent of this chapter or the comprehensive plan.

(i)  Conditions. The Board of Zoning Appeals and Adjustments may place reasonable conditions, limitations and requirements upon the granting of any variance, as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the intent of this chapter. Such conditions, limitations or requirements may be placed on the granting of any variance to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon other property in the neighborhood that might otherwise result from the reductions in dimensional standards being requested; including, but not limited to, conditions, limitations or requirements on the size, intensity of use, bulk and location of any structure; landscaping; lighting; the provision of adequate ingress and egress; and the duration of the variance.

(Code 1990, § 8-10-2; Ord. No. 638, § 1, Exh. A, 10-4-2000; Ord. No. 714, 11-16-2005; Ord. No. 1044, § 1, 11-16-2016) 
Sec. 8-10-3. - Findings. 
(a)  Trees within a City make up an urban forest, and its contribution to the general wellbeing and quality of life for the citizens of the City is recognized and valued. The urban forest provides aesthetic and economic enhancement of real property through a variety of colors, shapes, and sizes. The urban forest provides cooling shade which may reduce energy costs, natural barriers to noise, excessive light, and wind, a root system that reduces soil erosion and absorbs storm water, a canopy that produces oxygen and absorbs carbon dioxide and particulate matter. Furthermore, a network of trees provides potential natural habitat for wildlife. 
(b)  Preserving existing trees, and especially specimen trees provide immediate benefits to the development, and savings can be realized on clearing, grading, landscaping, and storm water management expenses. Preserving existing trees can also help developers meet requirements for buffers, screening and open space. Replacement of removed trees is essential in balancing pervious and impervious surfaces and allocating the benefits of the urban forest throughout the City. 
(c)  The City is authorized to protect the health, safety, aesthetics, convenience, order, prosperity and the general welfare of its current and future citizens: 
(1)  The City recognizes the social, economic and environmental benefits of trees in the urban environment; 
(2)  The City is committed to maintaining an urban forest to positively impact the public health, safety and general welfare of its current and future citizens; 
(3)  The City acknowledges a need to provide and enforce standards which incorporate tree preservation and landscape practices into the land development and building construction process; and 
(d)  The Mayor and City Council herein provide an ordinance that addresses the preservation of existing trees, prevention of the indiscriminate removal of trees, and requirements for replacement of trees through the land development and building construction process, within the City. 
(Code 1990, § 8-10-3; Ord. No. 638, § 1, Exh. A, 10-4-2000) 
Sec. 8-10-4. - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose and intent of the tree preservation and landscape ordinance is to establish policies, regulations and standards necessary to ensure that the City will continue to realize the benefits provided by its urban forest. The provisions of this chapter are enacted to: 
(a)  Provide standards for the preservation of trees, on public and private lands in the City, as part of the land development and building construction process; 
(b)  Prevent massive grading of land, both developed and undeveloped, without provision for replacement of trees; 
(c)  Protect designated trees from damage during construction; 
(d)  Ensure that a minimum density of trees, in a diversity of species and age classes, is distributed and maintained on all developed sites to maximize the benefits of a stable urban forest; and 
(e)  Provide guidelines for installation and maintenance of trees through good arboricultural practices. 
(Code 1990, § 8-10-4; Ord. No. 638, § 1, Exh. A, 10-4-2000)

(2)  A list of those trees to be planted and a total value of required tree density units (RTDU) and proposed tree density units (PTDU) for the entire property shall be included on the plan. The proposed tree density units must equal to or exceed the required tree density units. 
(3)  Replacement trees used in proposed tree density unit (PTDU) calculation must be site-specific plant material. A list of recommended replacement trees is provided in Appendix A of Ord. No. 638, recommended tree selection lists. 
(4)  The tree preservation plan and tree replacement plan may be combined into a tree preservation and tree replacement plan, so long as all applicable information for each plan is provided. 
(5)  The tree preservation and tree replacement plan shall act as a landscape development plan and must be approved prior to issuance of any land disturbance permit. 
(6)  Issuance of a valid land disturbance permit shall constitute an approval of the required tree preservation and replacement plan and shall indicate conformance to this provision of the regulation, unless there are revisions to such plan(s) during subsequent design phases. 
(d)  Revised tree preservation and tree replacement plan, if applicable. 
(1)  In such instances that modifications and/or revisions to the tree preservation and tree replacement plans have been submitted and approved by the Director during design phases, a final tree preservation and replacement plan shall be provided to the City at least 30 days prior to the final site inspection.

(Code 1990, § 8-10-7; Ord. No. 638, § 1, Exh. A, 10-4-2000) 
Sec. 8-10-8. - Minimum tree density requirements. 
(a)  Based on size. The value of existing and replacement trees shall be converted to tree density units based on size. This conversion promotes presentation of specimen trees and provides more credit for the preservation and planting of larger trees. Refer to Table 1 for conversion from DBH to tree density units for preserved trees, and Table 2 for conversion from caliper to tree density units for planted trees. 
(b)  Tree density factor (TDF). The tree density factor is provided to calculate required tree density units (RTDU), based on the property's designated zoning district classification. The associated tree density factor is multiplied by the total site acreage to determine required tree density units. 
Table I. Tree Density Factor 

 
Table I Note: The required tree density units (RTDU) may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, by planting new trees according to the minimum on-site planting requirements in this chapter or by a combination of the two. 
(c)  Renovation sites. When a building permit is requested for a renovation site, and where adequate trees do not exist, additional trees shall be planted. The required tree density units (RTDU), to be calculated for the renovation site as zoned, will be equal to one-third that required for new development. Also refer to Section 8-10-12, renovation site minimum planting requirements. 
Table 2. Existing Tree Density Unit Conversion 

 
Table 2 Note: Intervals include all partial measurements: 5—6 = 5.0—6.9 
(d)  Trees not counted toward existing tree density unit. Existing trees less than five inches DBH will not be eligible for tree density compliance purposes and therefore should not be counted toward existing tree density units. 
(e)  Reasonable efforts should be made to preserve specimen trees. Reasonable efforts shall include, but not be limited to, alternate building design, building location, parking area layout, parking area location, and water retention location. A specimen tree that is preserved through a process of alternative site design may be credited up to two times the assigned tree density unit value. Removal of specimen trees without prior approval constitutes a violation of this chapter and additional planting requirements and penalties shall apply. (Refer to Section 8-10-14, Violations, penalties, and appeals.) 
Table 3. Replacement Tree Density Unit Conversion 

 
Table 3 Notes: 
Intervals include all partial measurements: 3 = 3.0—3.9. 
Trees over 14 inches caliper are not recommended for transplanting. 
(f)  Trees not eligible for credit. Replacement trees (other than pines) less than one inch are not eligible for credit and replacement pine trees less than 0.5 inch are not eligible for credit. 
(g)  Replacement trees requirement. Trees replanted to achieve tree density requirements are to be selected species from the recommended tree selection lists found in Ordinance No. 638, Appendix A. Exceptions to this requirement must be authorized by the Director. 
(h)  No more that 40 percent of any one species may be included in any replanting plan. At least 50 percent of the trees replanted should be native, as denoted in the recommended tree selection lists. The Director may authorize modifications to these requirements. 
(i)  Future development sites. A tree preservation plan and tree replacement plan may not utilize any portion of the property that is planned for future development to calculate credit of existing trees or as a proposed location for replacement trees. 
(Code 1990, § 8-10-8; Ord. No. 638, § 1, Exh. A, 10-4-2000; Ord. No. 967, § 1, 6-18-2014; Memo of 8-15-2016) 
Sec. 8-10-9. - Alternative compliance to tree density requirements. 
(a)  The intent of this chapter is to ensure that a minimum density and variety of trees is maintained on all developed sites. To achieve this intent, as many trees as can reasonable be expected to survive must be planted on the site in question. Occasionally, this intent cannot be met because a site will not bear the required density of trees. To provide alternatives in such case, the following methods of compliance, at the discretion of the Director, may be acceptable: 
(1)  Planting on public property within the City limits at a location determined by the Director, in cooperation with the appropriate public entity (i.e., park planting must be coordinated with Parks and Recreation Department); or 
(2)  Contributing 120 percent of the cash value of the installed plant material to the City tree bank. 
(b)  The following standards have been established for administering these alternative compliance methods: 
(1)  The Director must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. 
(2)  In no instance shall more than 60 percent of the required site density be met through alternative compliance. 
(3)  No land disturbance permit shall be issued until the Director has approved the request and received the necessary documentation and/or funds. 
(Code 1990, § 8-10-9; Ord. No. 638, § 1, Exh. A, 10-4-2000) 
Sec. 8-10-9A. - Off-site planting. 
If trees are to be planted at another location, the tree preservation and replacement plan must include the following note: 
"A tree replacement plan addendum for this project shall be submitted to the Director or his/her designated agent(s) at least 30 days prior to requesting a final inspection. This plan shall include the species, size and location of trees to be planted off-site to meet the tree density deficit shown. Release of this project is subject to approval of this plan, as well as verification of the installation of the trees." 
(Code 1990, § 8-10-9A; Ord. No. 638, § 1, Exh. A, 10-4-2000) 
Sec. 8-10-9B. - Tree bank administration. 
(a)  The City tree bank will be administered by the Finance Director. 
(b)  Donations will be used for the sole purpose of planting trees on property within the City. All planting projects must be consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter. 
(c)  An annual report from the finance Director shall be submitted to the Director showing amounts collected, amounts spent and the type and location of trees planted. 
(d)  The acceptable cash value contribution amount shall be determined as follows: 
RTDU - PTDU = Deficient on-site tree density units. 
(e)  Divide the deficient on-site tree density unit value, or unit value which cannot be planted on the site, by 0.5 (the unit value of a two caliper replacement tree) and then multiply by $275.00. The value $275.00 represents the average cost of materials, labor and guarantee for two-inch caliper trees planted in the region. This amount will be updated annually, as required. 
(Code 1990, § 8-10-9B; Ord. No. 638, § 1, Exh. A, 10-4-2000) 
Sec. 8-10-10. - Tree protection. 
All tree protection measures shall be taken and related protective barriers shall be installed prior to any land disturbance or building construction. The Director shall be contacted for an on-site preconstruction conference prior to any land disturbance for approval of all tree protection measures. 
(a)  Tree protection measures. 
(1)  Mass grading for the construction of detached single-family dwellings shall be prohibited. Grading for the construction of detached single-family dwellings shall follow the natural contours of the lot with the necessary extent of grading determined on a lot-by-lot basis. 
(2)  Shield critical tree protection zone. Active protective barriers shall be installed along the outer edge of and completely surrounding the critical tree protection zones of all specimen trees or stands of trees, and otherwise designated tree save areas prior to any land disturbances. The tree save areas shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree(s) canopy as defined by the farthest canopy dripline of the tree(s). When necessary to protect the health of the tree, the Director's agent(s) may require a tree save area in excess of the area defined by the tree's dripline. Refer to Ordinance No. 638, Appendix C, Figure 4, critical tree protection zone. 
(3)  Prevent conflicts with utilities. Layout of the project site utility and grading plans shall accommodate the tree save areas. Utilities shall be placed along corridors between tree save areas. Underground utilities installed within a tree save area shall be installed by way of tunneling at a depth of 18 to 24 inches below grade, and not by way of trenching. 
(4)  Consider spacing for signage. Tree replacement/landscape development plans should consider signage and visibility requirements for the site. Signs shall be installed so as to prevent disturbances within tree save areas. Signage installed after approval of the landscape development plan shall accommodate trees and other cultivated landscape areas. 
(5)  Restrict construction activities. Construction site activities such as parking, storage, concrete washout, burnhole placement, and other activities shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within tree save areas. 
(b)  Protective barriers. 
(1)  Fencing. Tree fencing shall be a minimum four feet high, constructed in a post and rail configuration. A two-inch by four-inch post and a double one-inch by four-inch rail painted orange is recommended. Four-foot orange polyethylene laminar safety fencing is also acceptable. 
(2)  Signage. All critical tree protection areas shall be designated as such with "tree save area" signs posted visibly on all sides of the fenced in area. These signs are intended to inform subcontractors of the tree protection process. Signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with tree protection standards are also recommended for site entrances. 
(3)  Silt screening. All tree save areas shall be protected from the sedimentation of erosion material. Silt screening must be placed along the outer uphill edge of tree protective zones at the land disturbance interface. Silt screening should be backed by 12 gauge, two-inch by four-inch wire mesh fencing in areas of steep slope. 
All tree fencing and erosion control barriers shall be maintained throughout the land disturbance process and building construction, and shall not be removed until landscaping is installed. Refer to Ordinance No. 638, Appendix C, Figure 5, tree save area fencing and signage. 
The Director shall conduct follow-up site inspections and final inspections for enforcement of this chapter. Where the Director has determined that irreparable damage has occurred to trees within tree protective zones, a violation of the ordinance shall be recorded and applicable penalties will apply. (See Section 10-8-14, violations, penalties, and appeals.) 
(Code 1990, § 8-10-10; Ord. No. 638, § 1, Exh. A, 10-4-2000; Ord. No. 1044, § 2, 11-16-2016) 
Sec. 8-10-11. - Minimum on-site planting requirements. 
The replacement of trees may occur within the minimum buffers, yards, open space and buildable area of the property as defined by the zoning chapter. Refer to Ordinance No. 638, Appendix C, Figure 6, on-site planting areas. 
All trees listed in Ordinance No. 638, Appendix A, are eligible for tree density credit units toward the required tree density units. 
The approved tree preservation and tree replacement plans shall act as a preliminary landscape development plan. The landscape development plan shall indicate all preserved trees and appropriate protection measures, replacement trees and cultivated planting areas, and appropriate installation details as necessary to meet the minimum on-site planting requirements as follows: 
A.  Perimeter planting. 
(1)  A continuous landscape strip is required along the perimeter of the property wherever the property abuts a public right-of-way or public street (excluding driveways). 
(2)  The perimeter planting strip shall be a minimum width of ten feet, measured behind the street right-of-way line, from back of curb to back of curb. 
(3)  Perimeter planting strips may occur within required buffers or yards. The perimeter planting strip shall be planted with trees and other landscaping. The minimum number of trees required in the perimeter planting strip shall be determined by the total length of frontage along a public road or right-of-way, with a minimum of one tree for every 40 linear feet of public right-of-way frontage. Existing trees to be preserved may count toward perimeter planting. Refer to Ordinance No. 638, Appendix C, Figure 7, typical perimeter planting. 
(4)  At least 50 percent of the trees in the landscape strip must consist of shade trees. Trees may be grouped or spaced according to the species' spacing requirements. Refer to Ordinance No. 638, Appendix A, recommended tree selection lists, Tables 1-4. 
(5)  Where evenly spaced street trees exist within the public right-of-way, planted trees should be staggered to prevent conflict with existing trees and accommodate the full potential growth of the trees. Refer to Ordinance No. 638, Appendix C, Figure 8A and Figure 8B, perimeter planting with trees in right-of-way. 
B.  Parking lot perimeter planting. A continuous visual screen shall surround all parking lots adjacent to a public street or right-of-way. The screen shall be 30 inches in height and may be formed through creation of a planted hedge, wall, earth berm or combination of such. When using an earth berm, the slope shall not exceed 3:1 and the berm shall be planted with turf or other landscaping materials. Where the parking lot fronts a public street or public right-of-way, the visual screen may be included in the required perimeter planting strip. Refer to Ordinance No. 638, Appendix C, Figure 9, parking lot perimeter treatment, hedge option and Figure 10, parking lot perimeter treatment wall option. 
C.  Parking lot planting. Parking lots shall be designed with cultivated landscape areas, so that each parking space is no more than 70 feet from a shade tree, or 35 feet from any other tree. Refer to Ordinance No. 638, Appendix C, Figure 11, parking space planting radius. 
Where the parking lot fronts a public street or public right-of-way, trees preserved or planted in the perimeter planting strip may be used to meet the parking lot planting requirement. Additional trees may be planted in landscape median islands, landscape end islands, or interior landscape islands as described in the following sections: 
(1)  Landscape median island. 
i.  Interior linear landscape medians may be provided between parking bays. Landscape medians shall be a minimum eight-foot width, measured from back of curb to back of curb. Each tree planted in an interior landscape median is required to have a minimum of 200 square feet of planting area. When the landscape median extends to the end of a parking bay, a contiguous median end island, perpendicular to the landscape median, is required. 
ii.  Combination draining swale/planting strips are permitted, in lieu of curbed and sloped islands, provided that adequate drainage is provided for the chosen species. Refer to Ordinance No. 638, Appendix C, Figure 12, landscape median island options. 
(2)  Landscape end island, landscape median end island. 
i.  Landscape end islands may be provided at the end of a parking bay. Each tree planted in an end island is required to have a minimum of 200 square feet of planting area, with a minimum length equal to the length of the adjoining parking space, and a width of at least ten feet, measured from back of curb to back of curb. The end island may be contiguous with an interior landscape median. 
ii.  Refer to Ordinance No. 638, Appendix C, Figure 13, landscape end island options. 
(3)  Interior landscape island. 
i.  Interior landscape islands may be provided within parking lots and other paved areas. Each tree planted in an interior landscape island is required to have a minimum of 200 square feet of planting area, with at least eight feet in one direction, measured from back of curb to back of curb. The landscape island may be contiguous with an interior landscape median or a perimeter planting strip. 
ii.  The selection and spacing of replacement trees shall be compatible with site spatial limitations and shall take into consideration species' potential size and growth patterns. 
iii.  Equal interval spacing and/or grouping of trees is permitted, provided that at a minimum, 200 square feet of cultivated landscape area shall be provided for each tree planted. Tree density credit units will be given for trees where spacing does not violate the minimum spacing requirements for the species. Refer to Ordinance No. 638, Appendix A, recommended tree selection lists, Tables 1-4. 
iv.  Additional landscaping within cultivated planting areas is encouraged. At a minimum, all planting areas shall include a three inch layer of organic mulch. Pedestrian access through landscape medians and landscape islands should be directed toward appropriate pathways and otherwise discouraged though the use of additional landscaping. 
v.  Vehicle overhang into planting strips is allowable with a minimum of three feet between the face of curb or wheel stop and the trunk of a tree or center line of hedge planting. In a situation where a screen wall is specified in the landscape strip, a minimum of three feet will be maintained between the face of curb or wheel stop and the face of wall. Wheel stops will be used where curbing does not provide the minimum separation.

Sec. 8-10-12. - Renovation site minimum planting requirements. 
(a)  Planting requirements shall follow the minimum on-site planting requirements as generally described in Section 8-10-11(A) through (C) with the following additional stipulations and provisions: 
(b)  Existing healthy trees may be credited toward planting requirements, both internal and perimeter: 
(1)  If they remain undisturbed and the root zone is properly protected during construction; 
(2)  If they are provided with landscape areas that meet or exceed minimum size requirements; and 
(3)  If they have not been severely pruned or topped. 
(c)  Where a perimeter planting strip does not exist, trees are still required, and the minimum planting area shall be 200 square feet per tree. However, in lieu of a ten-foot wide perimeter planting strip, or median island, or interior landscape island, a pavement cut-out equal to 200 square feet and with a minimum width of five feet may be substituted. 
(d)  Where pavement cutouts on renovated sites and/or where new planting strips or islands are required, any pavement, construction debris or gravel sub-base must be removed. Existing compacted soil must be removed to a depth of 12 inches before adding new topsoil or existing soil may be uncompacted to a depth of 18 inches and amended to an appropriate soil mix.

CHAPTER 11. - STORMWATER 

Sec. 8-11-1. - Purpose. 
The City is authorized by the State Constitution, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs III (a)(6) thereof, State law, and the City Charter to provide stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the City, which services, systems and facilities contribute to the protection and preservation of the public health, safety and welfare, and protection of the natural resources of the City. The Federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 USC 1251 et seq.), other amendments and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Act, place increased emphasis on the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting and making available to its citizens and property owners stormwater management services which address water quality and volume impacts of stormwater runoff. The City is required to apply for and secure a NPDES Phase II permit by March 10, 2003. The City Council has determined that development in the City to date, and the outlook for continued development at an increasing rate in the future, has created and will continue to create a need for stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the City. The City has engaged a consultant to perform professional engineering and financial analyses of the City's stormwater management needs and the alternatives available to the City for dealing with stormwater management, and has received, reviewed and considered the results of the consultant's analyses which identify stormwater management needs, propose strategic program goals and priorities, estimate the cost of stormwater management services, systems and facilities, examine reasonable charges by the City for providing such services and facilities and project the rate base available within the City to support such costs. The City Council finds and concludes from the professional engineering and financial analyses that it would be desirable to provide for additional stormwater management services, systems and facilities within the City. The City Council finds and concludes from the professional engineering and financial analyses that a fair and equitable rate structure for those receiving the benefits of stormwater management services, systems and facilities, the proceeds of which will be dedicated to the Conyers Stormwater Utility for carrying out its purposes, will be essential if the City is to provide the level of stormwater management services, systems and facilities that would be desirable to meet the existing and future stormwater management needs of the City. 
(Code 1990, § 8-11-1; Ord. No. 664, 9-12-2002; Ord. No. 900, § 1, 12-5-2012) 
Sec. 8-11-2. - Findings. 
The City Council makes the following findings of fact: 
(1)  The professional engineering and financial analyses conducted on behalf of and submitted to the City assesses and defines the stormwater management issues, existing needs, goals, program priorities and operational opportunities of the City. 
(2)  It is reasonable and prudent to anticipate that additional stormwater issues and future stormwater management needs will continue to occur as development within the City continues. 
(3)  Given the existing issues, needs, goals, priorities and operational opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the City and given the likelihood that additional stormwater issues and future stormwater management needs will continue to occur in the future, it is appropriate to authorize the establishment of an accounting unit which shall be dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater management services, systems and facilities in the City. 
(4)  The stormwater needs in the City include, but are not limited to, protecting the public health, safety and welfare. Provision of stormwater management services, systems and facilities and regulation of the use therefor renders and/or results in both service and benefit to individual properties, property owners, citizens and residents of the City in a variety of ways. 
(5)  The service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management services, systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations, including, but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed upon the stormwater management services, systems and facilities, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of properties in the City in proportion to the long term demands the properties owned impose on the City's stormwater management services, systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits to such properties and the owners thereof. 
(6)  The City presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed, installed and acquired through various mechanisms over many years. The future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the City, and of future additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the City to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use and enhance the stormwater management systems and facilities in the City. In order to do so, the City must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management services, systems and facilities. 
(7)  A stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the City. 
(8)  A schedule of stormwater utility service charges based on existing land uses and the calculated area of impervious surfaces located on properties within each land use category is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the City. 
(9)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the Conyers Stormwater Utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the service charge on that property in the form of a credit, and that such credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the City Manager or his/her designee. 
(10)  The calculated area of impervious surfaces on properties within each land use category is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services, systems and facilities provided by the City or to be provided by the City in the future, and the calculated area of impervious surfaces on properties within each land use category is therefore the most appropriate and dominant parameter for calculating an equitable periodic stormwater service charge. 
(11)  It is imperative that the proceeds from all service charges for stormwater management services, systems and facilities, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, systems and facilities, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and that such proceeds of service charges and other revenues allocated for that purpose shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the Conyers Stormwater Utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and nonoperating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes. 
(Code 1990, § 8-11-2; Ord. No. 664, 9-12-2002; Ord. No. 900, § 1, 12-5-2012) 
Sec. 8-11-3. - Stormwater Utility and Enterprise Fund established. 
(a)  There is established a stormwater utility to be known as the Conyers Stormwater Utility, which shall be responsible for stormwater management services, systems and facilities throughout the City, and which shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of the City's stormwater management services, systems and facilities. 
(b)  There is established a Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund in the City budgeting and accounting systems for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the Conyers Stormwater Utility, including all service charges and other revenues which are appropriated and allocated to the Conyers Stormwater Utility. All revenues and receipts of the Conyers Stormwater Utility shall be placed in the Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund, and all expenses and capital investments of the Conyers Stormwater Utility shall be paid from the Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund; provided, however, that other revenues, receipts and resources not accounted for in the Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund may be applied to stormwater management services, systems and facilities as deemed appropriate by the City Council. 
(c)  The City Council places within the Conyers Stormwater Utility the responsibility for operation, maintenance and regulation of the existing and future stormwater management services, systems and facilities previously performed, owned and operated or maintained by the City, and other related assets, including, but not limited to, properties, other than road rights-of-way, upon which such stormwater management systems and facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access and certain equipment used solely for stormwater management. This responsibility shall be placed with the Conyers Stormwater Utility as the City Manager has determined that the Conyers Stormwater Utility has been sufficiently organized, staffed and funded to adequately carry out such responsibilities. The City Manager shall determine which Department of the City's organizational structure to place the Conyers Stormwater Utility in, and the City Manager may move the stormwater utility to other departments from time-to-time as sees fit.

(Code 1990, § 8-11-5; Ord. No. 664, 9-12-2002; Ord. No. 900, § 1, 12-5-2012) 
Sec. 8-11-6. - On-site systems and facilities; enforcement methods and inspections. 
(a)  Every owner of real property located in the City, and every person which serves as a contractor for the purpose of developing real property located in the City shall, as to the real property owned or being developed, provide, manage, maintain and operate on-site stormwater management systems and facilities sufficient to collect, convey, detain, control and discharge stormwater in a manner which is in compliance with all of the City ordinances, rules and regulations, the laws, rules and regulations of the State and the United States, and which, in any event, will not discharge stormwater in a manner which will flood, damage or otherwise harm property which is located downstream from the real property owned or being developed. A failure by an owner and/or developer to meet the obligations and requirements imposed by this article shall constitute a private nuisance and the parties damaged thereby and/or the City may bring an action to abate such nuisance.

Sec. 8-11-7. - Service charges. 
(a)  It shall be the policy of the City that service charges for stormwater management services, systems and facilities to be provided by the Conyers Stormwater Utility be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services, systems and facilities by individual properties and the level of service rendered by or resulting from the provision of stormwater management services, systems and facilities. Stormwater service charge rates shall be structured so as to be fair and reasonable, and the resultant service charges shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities for the subject property. Similarly situated properties shall be charged similar service charges. In setting the service charge rates for stormwater management services, systems and facilities, the City Council shall also take into consideration the impact such will have in regulating the use of such services, systems and facilities. 
(b)  The service charge for stormwater management services, systems and facilities to be provided by the Conyers Stormwater Utility shall be based upon the existing use of the subject property at the time such service charge is assessed and with the accompanying area of impervious surface typically located with properties of similar size with similar land use. 
(c)  The cost of stormwater management services, systems and facilities may include operating expenses, capital investments and reserve accounts. 
(d)  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater service charges and/or other methods of funding stormwater management shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the City's standards by private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities. 
(Code 1990, § 8-11-7; Ord. No. 664, 9-12-2002; Ord. No. 900, § 1, 12-5-2012) 
Sec. 8-11-8. - Service charge rates. 
Stormwater service charge rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the City Council. In setting or modifying such rates it shall be the goal of the City Council to establish rates that are fair and reasonable, reflect the value of the stormwater management services, systems and facilities to those property owners who benefit therefrom, and which, together with other sources of support available to the Conyers Stormwater Utility, are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management services, systems and facilities, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, nonoperating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the City Council. The annual stormwater service charge rates shall be subject to the exemptions and credits provided in Section 8-11-9 and will be as established by the City Council, from time to time. 
(Code 1990, § 8-11-8; Ord. No. 664, 9-12-2002; Ord. No. 900, § 1, 12-5-2012) 
Sec. 8-11-9. - Exemptions and credits applicable to service charges. 
(a)  Except as provided in this section, no public or private property located in the service area shall be exempt from stormwater service charges or receive a credit or offset against such stormwater service charges. No exemption, credit, offset or other reduction in stormwater service charges shall be granted based on the tax status, economic status, race, religion, age or sex of the owner of the property being served, or based on any other condition unrelated to the provision of stormwater management services, systems and facilities. A Stormwater Service Charge Credit Technical Manual has been prepared by the City's technical consultants specifying the design and performance standards of on-site and off-site privately owned and maintained stormwater systems, facilities, assets, services and activities that qualify for application of a credit, and how such credits shall be calculated. 
(b)  Forest/open properties shall be exempt from stormwater service charges. 
(c)  Railroad tracks and accompanying rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater service charges. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings or other developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater service charges. 
(d)  Public roadways, not including driveways, shall be exempt from stormwater service charges. 
(e)  The State and County government-owned properties shall be exempt from stormwater service charges. Properties owned by the United States and the City other than roadways shall not be exempt from such charges except as otherwise provided by law. 
(f)  All properties which are not forest/open properties as defined herein may receive a credit against the stormwater service charge applicable to the property based on attaining and continuing compliance with the technical requirements and performance standards contained in the Stormwater Service Charge Credit Technical Manual for obtaining a credit. The stormwater service charge credit for privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site stormwater control systems, facilities or assets that reduce or mitigate the impact of impervious surfaces on the subject property may be up to 50 percent of the stormwater service charge applicable to the property. The credit for services and activities that reduce or mitigate the Conyers Stormwater Utility's cost of providing stormwater management services, systems and facilities shall not be related to the cost of such services and activities to the person providing such services and activities and shall not exceed 50 percent of the stormwater service charge applicable to the subject property. 
(g)  In order to obtain a credit, the property owner must make application to the City Manager or his/her designee on forms provided by the City for that purpose. When an application for a credit is complete, the City Manager or his/her designee shall issue a decision granting the credit in whole or in part, or denying the credit within 30 days thereafter. Credits applied for by the property owner and granted in whole or in part shall be reflected on the next annual billing statement. 
(h)  A property owner must reapply annually by not later than April 1 of each year for the previously extended credit to be reextended for the following billing cycle. The failure of a property owner to timely reapply to extend the credit for the following billing cycle shall result in no such credit being extended for the following billing cycle. 
(i)  The City Manager or his/her designee may review any credit issued to a property owner and the basis therefor at any time and may rescind the credit if he or she finds grounds therefor. If a credit is rescinded, the property owner may appeal such rescission pursuant to Section 8-11-11, or may, if possible, correct the deficiencies which caused the rescission and reapply for the credit. In addition to other City requirements for a credit, a property owner with a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, however, must submit the report prescribed in the NPDES permit to the City Manager or his/her designee to continue to receive the credit from the Conyers Stormwater Utility associated with the NPDES permit. 
(Code 1990, § 8-11-9; Ord. No. 664, 9-12-2002; Ord. No. 900, § 1, 12-5-2012) 
Sec. 8-11-10. - Service charge billing, delinquencies and collections. 
A bill for stormwater service charges may be sent through the United States Postal Service or by alternative means, notifying the owner of the property being billed of the amount of the stormwater service charge, less any issued credits, the date the payment is due, and the date when payment is past due. The stormwater service charge may be billed and collected separately or along with property taxes or other fees or charges as deemed most effective and efficient by the City Manager or his/her designee. Frequency of the billing of stormwater service charges shall be annually unless otherwise specified by the City Council. Failure to receive a bill shall not be justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land subject to stormwater service charges shall be obligated to pay stormwater service charges and any interest on delinquent stormwater service charge payments. If a property owner is underbilled, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of developed land, the Conyers Stormwater Utility may backbill for a period of up to one year, but shall not be entitled to any interest for any delinquency during the backbilled period. An interest charge of 1.5 percent, per month, on the unpaid balance of any stormwater service charge shall be imposed when that stormwater service charge remains unpaid for 30 days past its payment due date. Such interest charge shall continue until the stormwater service charge is paid. 
(Code 1990, § 8-11-10; Ord. No. 664, 9-12-2002; Ord. No. 900, § 1, 12-5-2012)

(1)  Any appeal must be filed in writing with the City Manager or his/her designee. The appeal shall include a written statement setting forth the factual basis for the appeal.

Sec. 9-10-1. - Purpose. 
(a)  Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments on the community in the findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41(1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres , 426 U.S. 50 (1976); and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Cleveland, Ohio; findings from the report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Mayor and City Council take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. 
(b)  It is the finding of the Mayor and City Council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or adult entertainment, (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community. 
(c)  Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described. The Mayor and City Council finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the City, as well. 
(d)  Furthermore, it is the finding of the Mayor and City Council that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult book stores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding communities. 
(e)  The Mayor and City Council therefore find that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and children's day care facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the Mayor and City Council find that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment. The Mayor and City Council find that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further finds that such will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this article is hereby adopted.

Any person who operates motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, low-speed vehicles and other similar vehicles is responsible for procuring appropriate insurance as may be required by any State of Georgia law or this chapter as a condition of operating motorized carts, personal transportation vehicles, low-speed vehicles and other similar vehicles on the public streets in the City of Conyers.

(1)  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the dwelling, building or structure can be made at reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
(2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the dwelling, building or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building or structure and all debris from the property. 
(d)  For the purposes of this subsection, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination.

Such abatement action shall commence within 270 calendar days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 calendar days in which such abatement action must commence. The Public Officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling or structure a placard with the following words: 
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupancy of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
(f)  If the City Manager or his or her designee has the structure demolished, then reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any monies received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The City Manager or his or her designee and the City are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
(g)  The cost of bringing a complaint pursuant to this chapter, together with any costs reasonably incurred by the City in abatement of a public nuisance after determination thereof by the Municipal Court, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the county tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be in a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. Such lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the Rockdale County Superior Court Clerk and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice. The Rockdale County Superior Court Clerk shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the Rockdale County deed records and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. 
(h)  The City may enforce its lien in the following manner: 
(1)  Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this chapter, the City Manager or his or her designee shall transmit to the Rockdale County Tax Commissioner a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the City Manager or his or her designee shall be transmitted within 90 calendar days of completion of the repairs, demolition, or closure. It shall be the duty of the Rockdale County Tax Commissioner or the City revenue officer who is responsible or whose duties include the collection of municipal taxes, to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of Section 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The Rockdale County Tax Commissioner shall collect and enforce municipal liens imposed pursuant to this chapter in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-5-359.1. The Rockdale County Tax Commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the City whose lien is being collected. 
(2)  Enforcement of liens pursuant to this chapter may be initiated at any time following receipt by the Rockdale County Tax Commissioner of the final determination of costs in accordance with this chapter. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this chapter. 
(3)  The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this chapter shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this chapter together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the governing authority, county tax commissioner, or City revenue officer in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. 
(i)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the City agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
(j)  Nothing contained herein shall prevent or prohibit the Municipal Court from publishing by its contempt powers any owner or parties in interest that willfully fail or refuse to comply with an order entered in accordance with this chapter.

CHAPTER 4. - GRAFFITI 

Sec. 11-4-1. - Intent and purpose. 
The Mayor and City Council find and determine that graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive of the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to prevent graffiti and to promote its eradication and to prevent related vandalism, as they adversely affect property, both public and private, including, but not limited to, trees, signs, poles, fixtures, utility boxes, walls, paths, walks, streets, refuse receptacles, buildings and/or any other structures or surfaces which contain graffiti or are subject to graffiti-related vandalism. Furthermore, graffiti promotes blight in the neighborhoods in which it occurs. Without prompt removal of graffiti, other properties become the target of graffiti and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to live and work. Therefore, the Mayor and City Council, acting in the interest of public health, safety and welfare, further find and declare that to be truly effective in the deterrence, eradication and removal of graffiti, it is necessary to implement a comprehensive anti-graffiti ordinance.

Sec. 12-2-1. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this chapter is to safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating, and controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land in the City. 
(b)  Compliance to minimum requirements. Where this section requires compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in Section 12-2-4, the City shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements as if a permit had been issued and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders. 
(Ord. No. 799, § 1(12-2-1), 6-2-2010) 
Sec. 12-2-2. - Exemptions. 
This chapter shall apply to any land disturbing activity undertaken by any person on any land except for the following: 
(a)  Surface mining, as the same is defined in O.C.G.A. § 12-4-72, the Georgia Surface Mining Act of 1968; 
(b)  Granite quarrying and land clearing for such quarrying; 
(c)  Such minor land disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion; 
(d)  The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre and not otherwise exempted under this subsection; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and this subsection. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this subsection, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the Director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b) and the buffer zones provided by this subsection shall be enforced by the City; 
(e)  Agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. § 1-3-3, definitions, to include:

(Ord. No. 799, § 1(12-2-2), 6-2-2010) 
Sec. 12-2-3. - Definitions. 
Unless otherwise specifically stated, the definitions set forth in Section 12-1-1 shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 799, § 1(12-2-3), 6-2-2010) 
Sec. 12-2-4. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land disturbing activities if requirements of this chapter and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities that are not exempted by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of these subsections and Sections 12-2-4(b) and 12-2-5. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this chapter and the NPDES General Permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in these subsections and Sections 12-2-4(b) and 12-2-5 shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the EPD Director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with this section or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a City or of any State General Permit issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the EPD Director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by the City or any State General Permit issued by the EPD pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The Director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The City may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in Section 12-2-5(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(Ord. No. 799, § 1(12-2-4), 6-2-2010) 
Sec. 12-2-5. - The erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan (plan). 
(a)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq., for the purpose of governing land disturbing activities, shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the State General Permit and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
1.  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
2.  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
3.  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
4.  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
5.  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
6.  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
7.  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
8.  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
9.  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
10.  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
11.  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
12.  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
13.  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
14.  Land disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in Section 12-2-4(b)(2); 
15.  Except as provided in Subsection (a)16 of this section, Riparian Buffer Protection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all State waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the Director or City Manager or his/her designee determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the Director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as being along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the Director or as provided in Chapter 3 of this title, Riparian Buffer Protection provisions by the City Manager or his/her designee. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a riparian buffer, and a riparian buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a riparian buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a riparian buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The State and riparian buffers shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
(i)  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
(ii)  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
16.  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any State waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the Board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The Director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
1.  No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
2.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
(i)  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
(ii)  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(b)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent the City from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in Section 12-3-5. 
(c)  The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit.

(Ord. No. 799, § 1(12-2-5), 6-2-2010) 
Sec. 12-2-6. - Application permit process. 
(a)  Generally. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal of the general development plans. The City shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
1.  No person shall conduct any land disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City without first obtaining a permit from the Planning and Inspections Department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
2.  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City of Conyers and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in Section 12-2-7. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of Sections 12-2-4(b) and 12-2-5 will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
3.  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the State General Permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a), half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the Division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the Division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
4.  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the City shall refer the application and plan to the District for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The District shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the District to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the District review shall be forwarded to the City. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the District, any variances required by Subsections (15) and (16) of this section have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per Subsection (b)(6) of this section have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the City and the District have entered into an agreement which allows the City to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the District. The City shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the City with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
5.  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the City may deny the permit application. 
6.  The City may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the City may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the City with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(Ord. No. 799, § 1(12-2-6), 6-2-2010) 
Sec. 12-2-7. - Plan requirements. 
(a)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in Sections 12-2-4(b) and 12-2-5 or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter. The plan for the land disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and State laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the Commission and in consultation with the Division and the Stakeholder Advisory Board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20.

Sec. 12-2-8. - Permit. 
(a)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the City of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(b)  No permit shall be issued by the City unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the District and the City has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this chapter, any variances required by Section 12-2-5(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per Section 12-2-6(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(c)  Any land disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this chapter, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(d)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(e)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the City, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this chapter. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(f)  The City may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
(Ord. No. 799, § 1(12-2-8), 6-2-2010) 
Sec. 12-2-9. - Certification and education. 
(a)  Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspection or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on their level of involvement with the process, as developed by the Commission in consultation with the Division and the Stakeholder Advisory Board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(b)  For each site on which land disturbing activity occurs, each entity or person acting as either a primary, secondary, or tertiary permittee, as defined in the State General Permit, shall have as a minimum one person who is in responsible charge of erosion and sedimentation control activities on behalf of said entity or person and meets the applicable education or training certification requirements developed by the Commission present on site whenever land disturbing activities are conducted on that site. A project site shall herein be defined as any land disturbance site or multiple sites within a larger common plan of development or sale permitted by an owner or operator for compliance with the State General Permit. 
(c)  Persons or entities involved in projects not requiring a state general permit but otherwise requiring certified personnel on site may contract with certified persons to meet the requirements of this chapter. 
(d)  If a State General Permittee who has operational control of land disturbing activities for a site has met the certification requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(1), then any person or entity involved in land disturbing activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet those educational requirements specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(4) and shall not be required to meet any educational requirements that exceed those specified in said requirement. 
(Ord. No. 799, § 1(12-2-9), 6-2-2010) 
Sec. 12-2-10. - Inspection and enforcement. 
(a)  The City will periodically inspect the sites of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the City shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the State General Permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this chapter, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. 
(b)  The City must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
(c)  The City shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this chapter, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land disturbing activities. 
(d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the City, the Commission, the District, or Division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
(e)  The District or the Commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of the City which has been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The District or the Commission or both may provide technical assistance to the City for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the City's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The District or the Commission shall notify the Division and request investigation by the Division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found.

(a)  A riparian buffer variance granted from the City does not supersede the State buffer requirements which are set forth below as Subsections (1) and (2) of this section. If any disturbance is proposed within a State buffer, a State buffer variance must be filed with EPD. 
(1)  Except as provided in Subsection (2) of this section, there is established a 25-foot State buffer along the banks of all State waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the Director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the EPD Director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the State buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the EPD Director as provided in this section. The following requirements shall apply to any such State buffer: No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a State buffer, and a State buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a State buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a State buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
(2)  There is established a 50-foot State buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot State buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the Board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the State buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The EPD Director may grant a variance from such State buffer to allow land disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such State buffer: No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a State buffer, and a State buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a State buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a State buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed.

Sec. 12-4-1. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This chapter seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
(2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
(3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
(5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the City's greenspace program; 
(6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
(7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this chapter: 
(a)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
(1)  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
(2)  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and 
(3)  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the City Manager or his or her designee are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
(b)  Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
(1)  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
(2)  Detention: 
a.  24-hour extended detention storage of the one year, 24-hour return frequency storm event, 
b.  This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the City Manager or his or her designee for sites that discharge directly into larger streams, rivers, wetlands or lakes, or to a manmade channel or conveyance system where the reduction in these flows will not have an impact on upstream or downstream streambank or channel integrity; 
(3)  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
(c)  Overbank flooding protection. 
(1)  Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one year, 24-hour storm under Subsection (b) of this section is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. 
(2)  This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the City Manager or his or her designee for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
(d)  Extreme flooding protection. 
(1)  Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated, and that all applicable requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program (FEMA) are adhered to. 
(2)  This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the City Manager or his or her designee for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
(e)  Structural stormwater controls. 
(1)  All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function, including, but not limited to: general application structural controls, limited application structural controls, or detention structural controls. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the City Manager or his or her designee before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the City Manager or his or her designee may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
(2)  Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
(f)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under Subsection (a) of this section. The applicant may, if approved by the City Manager or his or her designee, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements that identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Conyers Stormwater Credit Manual. 
(g)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catchbasins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way.
