ARTICLE 6. - RULES FOR ALL DISTRICTS 
  
  
Div. 6.1. - Measurements and Exceptions 

Sec. 6.1.1. - Lot Parameters 
A.  Lot   
1.  A parcel of land, either vacant or occupied, intended as a unit for the purpose, whether immediate or for the future, of transfer of ownership, or possession, or for development. 
2.  For use as a development site, a lot must be a lot recorded as part of a plat in the Fulton County deed records. 
3.  A development site may include a group of contiguous lots owned or functionally controlled by the same person or entity, assembled for the purpose of development. With permission from the Director, a development site may be treated as one lot, even though multiple tax parcels are included. 
B.  Lot Lines Each lot line must have a designation of primary street, side street, common side or rear as follows. 

1.  Primary Street Lot Line A lot line separating the lot from a primary street. 
2.  Side Street Lot Line A lot line separating the lot from a side street. 
3.  Rear Lot Line   
a.  A lot line which is opposite and most distant from the primary street lot line. 
b.  On irregularly-shaped lots, the rear lot line is determined as the line connecting two points each measured 10 feet along the side lot lines starting from the intersection of the two side lot lines. This rear lot line is intended for the purpose of establishing the rear setback and lot depth only. When a rear lot line cannot be determined in this manner, the rear lot line will be determined by the Director. 
4.  Common Side Lot Line Any lot line not considered a Primary Street, Side Street or Rear lot line. 
C.  Primary and Side Street Designation   
1.  Where only one street abuts a lot, that street is considered a primary street. 
2.  A multiple street frontage lot must designate at least one primary street. A lot may have more than one primary street. The Director will determine which streets are primary streets based on: 
a.  The pedestrian orientation of the street, existing or proposed; 
b.  The established orientation of buildings on the block; 
c.  The street or streets abutting the longest face of the block; 
d.  The street or streets parallel to an alley within the block; 
e.  The street from which the lot takes its address; and 
f.  The street with the highest classification or highest traffic counts. 
D.  Lot Area Lot area is the contiguous land area included within the lot lines. Lot area does not include existing or proposed right-of-way, whether dedicated or not dedicated to public use. 

E.  Lot Width and Lot Depth   
1.  Lot width is the distance between the two side lot lines measured at the primary street property line along a straight line or along the property line on a curvilinear lot. 
2.  Lot depth is the distance between the front and rear lot lines measured along a line midway between the side lot lines. 

F.  Lot Frontage   
1.  Lot frontage is the length of any lot line abutting a primary street, side street, alley (for rear-loaded townhouses only) or courtyard (for a cottage court). 
2.  Every lot must have frontage upon a public street, private street designed and built to public standards, or required courtyard for a cottage court. 
G.  Density   
Density is not specifically regulated. The maximum number of units allowed for single unit detached or attached is directly related to the minimum lot size of the underlying zoning district. The maximum number of units allowed for multi-unit residential dwellings is a function of lot size, utilities, easements, rights-of-way, stormwater, parking and height. 
H.  Lot Coverage   
1.  Lot coverage includes: 
a.  The horizontal area of the building footprint measured within the outside of the exterior walls of the ground floor of all principal buildings and any roofed accessory building on the lot; and 
b.  Any impervious parking areas, driveways, walkways, steps, terraces, uncovered patios and decks, swimming pools, and any similar features. The Director may establish rules for determining the extent to which partially pervious materials are exempt from the lot coverage. 
2.  In RU- and RT- zoning districts, lot coverage can be assessed at the individual lot level, with each lot meeting lot coverage independently, or at the project level, in which case the pervious areas required to meet the lot coverage for the whole development must be under common ownership and indicated on the recorded plat. 
3.  100% area credit will be given for pervious pavers and 50% area credit for pervious concrete. Other materials will be evaluated upon request. 
4.  For legal nonconforming lots that are smaller than the minimum lot area required by their respective zoning districts, lot coverage is calculated by accounting for the maximum lot coverage allowed in both the district and the nearest district with a smaller minimum lot area. The total area of the lot is divided in two parts, one as the minimum lot area of the nearest zoning district, and the other as the remainder of the total area. The respective maximum lot coverage is then applied to the two parts. As an example, the lot coverage of a lot in RE-1 that is 34,000 sq.ft. in size is calculated as the sum of 27,000 sq.ft. at 30% and 7,000 sq.ft. at 25%, for a the maximum lot coverage of 9,850 sq.ft. 
5.  In RE- and RD- districts, the base maximum lot coverage may be supplemented by 5% if mitigation measures are implemented. The mitigation consists of providing stormwater infiltration for the additional impervious area beyond the base maximum lot coverage at a rate of 2.4 inches in 24 hours. 

I.  Outdoor Amenity Space   
1.  General   
a.  Outdoor amenity space is common outdoor area provided in a development for use by all of its occupants for social and recreational activities. Outdoor amenity space may also be provided for use by the general public, in addition to occupants of the development. 
b.  Examples of outdoor amenity space include swimming pools, playgrounds, sport courts, dog parks, gardens, community gardens, parks, greens, pavilions, seating areas, plazas, common balconies, rooftop decks or rooftop gardens. 
2.  Standards   
a.  Required outdoor amenity space must be provided on the lot and be accessible as outdoor space. A required landscape buffer may not be used to meet the outdoor amenity space requirement. 
b.  Required outdoor amenity space may be enclosed on two sides or less by walls (with or without a solid roof cover) or enclosed on three sides by walls without a solid roof cover. 
c.  Required outdoor amenity space may be located at or above grade. In RM-, RX- and CC- Districts, outdoor amenity space must be located at grade. 
d.  Required outdoor amenity space may be met in one contiguous outdoor area or in multiple outdoor areas on a lot and must have a minimum area of 625 square feet with no dimension less than 25 feet. 
e.  Required outdoor amenity space must not be parked or driven upon, except for emergency access and permitted temporary events. 
f.  At least 50% of the total amount of required outdoor amenity space at grade and 25% of required outdoor amenity space above grade must be planted with groundcover, shrubs or trees. For the purposes of this Section, turf grass is not considered groundcover. 
g.  Seating must be provided at the rate of 1 seat for every 500 square feet or fraction of 500 square feet. Seats may be permanent or movable. Two linear feet of bench or seat wall equals one seat. 
h.  When a path is located in a natural setting (such as a stream buffer) or other greenspace that cannot be used as amenity space in its entirety, the path may count towards the outdoor amenity space area calculation by using a width of 25 feet, multiplied by the length of the path. 
( Ord. of 4-17-2018(4) , §§ 6-1—6-2.1) 
Sec. 6.1.2. - Building Placement 
A.  Building Setbacks   
1.  Type of Setbacks There are 4 types of setbacks: primary street, side street, common side and rear. Building setbacks apply to both principal and accessory buildings or structures except where this Development Code explicitly states otherwise. 

2.  Measurement of Building Setbacks   
a.  A primary street setback is measured at a right angle (perpendicular) to the primary street lot line. 
b.  A side street setback is measured at a right angle (perpendicular) from the side street lot line. 
c.  A rear setback is measured at a right angle (perpendicular) to the rear property line or the rear lot line. 
d.  All lot lines which are not primary street, side street or rear lot lines are considered common side lot lines for the purpose of measuring setbacks. Common side setbacks are measured at a right angle (perpendicular) from the side lot line. 
e.  All setbacks are drawn using an extension of a line perpendicular to the lot line until they intersect with another setback line. 

f.  Reserved. 
g.  Where street right-of-way dedication occurs, all setbacks are measured from the final property line.

3.  The required percentage specifies the amount of the building façade that must be located in the build-to zone. This percentage is calculated as the width of the building façade within the build-to zone divided by the total street frontage of the lot. 

4.  The width of a parking entrance into or through a building does not count towards the build-to requirement. However, in no case will access to an irregularly-shaped parcel that has no alternative access options be denied due to application of the build-to requirement. In all cases where access is necessary, a driveway of the minimum acceptable width for fire safety purposes is allowed, even where it reduces the building width below the required build-to percentage. 
5.  On a corner lot, a building must be placed within or abutting the area where the build-to zones of 2 intersecting streets overlap. The building must extend within the build-to zone for a minimum of 30 feet in both directions.

2.  Once the required percentage has been met for the entire lot or site, new buildings may be placed outside of the build-to zone. 

E.  Build-to Zone: Additions   
1.  Front Additions Any addition to the front of an existing building must be placed in the build-to zone. The addition does not have to meet the required percentage for the entire lot or site. Front additions no greater than 10% cumulatively of the existing building footprint are allowed outside of the build-to zone. 

2.  Side Additions Side additions no greater than 20% cumulatively of the existing building footprint are allowed outside of the build-to zone. Once the required percentage for the entire lot or site has been met, side additions of any size are allowed. 

3.  Rear Additions   
a.  Rear additions are allowed outside of the build-to zone. 

b.  Rear additions on corner lots where the side street does not meet the build-to requirement must include additional street planting to screen the side street for the length of the existing and expanded building. The screening must consist of a 10-foot landscape strip planted with trees every 30 feet on center and landscaped with shrubs. 

F.  Parking Location   
1.  All parking spaces must be located consistent with the parking location requirements. 
2.  Where parking is allowed in a yard, it may be placed between the principal or accessory building and the lot line (but not in a required buffer), in accordance with the parking setback if applicable.

1.  All parking spaces (surface and structured) must be located behind the parking setback line. 
2.  Parking below and covered by the ground may encroach into a required parking setback but must not extend into a required easement or the right-of-way or within 3 feet of any common side lot line. 
3.  The parking setback applies to the ground story only. 
4.  Parking setbacks are measured from the right-of-way, private street easement or property line. 
H.  Parking Structures   
1.  Required parking setbacks apply only to the ground floor of the parking structure. 
2.  The ground story of a structure parking garage facing any street (not including an alley) in the SX- District or where the -SH Frontage applies must have active uses (such as, but not limited to, residential, commercial, office or civic space, where permitted) within the parking setback. No active uses are required for portions of the parking structure located interior to the minimum parking setback.

Div. 7.5. - Commercial Uses 

Sec. 7.5.1. - Adult Establishment 
A.  Defined Adult establishment is defined as set forth in Sec. 26-22 of the City Code. 
B.  Intent and Findings It is the intent of this Section to regulate the place and manner of the operation of Adult Establishments as defined in Sec. 26-22 of the City Code. It is well established and has been the experience of other communities in Georgia and throughout the United States that adult establishments have been associated with disorderly conduct, prostitution, negative impacts on surrounding properties, and other adverse secondary effects. This Section advances the substantial government interest in promoting and protecting public health, safety, and general welfare, and maintaining law and order. The Section is narrowly constructed to protect the First Amendment rights of citizens of Sandy Springs while furthering the substantial governmental interest of combating the secondary effects of adult establishments from areas and uses in the community which are incompatible. Areas and uses which are to be protected from adult establishments include but are not limited to residential, churches, day care centers, libraries, recreational facilities, and schools. The City Council hereby readopts and incorporates by reference the findings and secondary effects evidence concerning adult establishments in the legislative record for Chapter 26, Article II of the Code of the City of Sandy Springs, Georgia and for ordinances adopting and amending those provisions. Specifically, the City Council incorporates here all of the secondary effects evidence and findings contained in Sec. 26-21 of the City Code. 
The City Council finds, based upon an October, 1980, study by the Minnesota Crime Prevention Center, Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota, entitled "An Analysis of the Relationship Between Adult Entertainment Establishments, Crime, and Housing Values", that adult establishments are significantly related to diminishing market values of neighboring residential areas, that adult establishments should not be located in residential areas, and that adult establishments should be permitted only in locations that are at least 1/10 mile, or approximately 500 feet, from residential areas. 
The City Council further finds, based upon a June, 1978, study by the Division of Planning of the St. Paul, Minnesota, Department of Planning and Economic Development and the Community Crime Prevention Project of the Minnesota Crime Control Planning Board entitled "Effects on Surrounding Area of Adult Entertainment Businesses in Saint Paul", that the presence of adult establishments correlates with a decreasing market value of neighboring residential areas, that adult establishments tend to locate in areas of poorer residential condition, tend to be followed by a relative worsening of the residential condition, and that more than two adult establishments in an immediate area is associated with a statistically significant decrease in residential property market value, and that such a concentration of adult establishments in a given area should be discouraged. The study also finds that such worsening of residential conditions will adversely affect uses found in residential areas or in the proximity of residential areas, such as public recreational facilities, public or private institutional uses, churches, schools, universities, colleges, trade-schools, libraries, and day care centers. 
The City Council further finds, based upon a May 19, 1986, land use study conducted in Austin, Texas, that an adult establishment within one block of a residential area decreases the market value of homes, that adult establishments are considered a sign of decline by lenders, making underwriters hesitant to approve the 90-95 percent financing many home buyers require, and that patrons of adult establishments tend to be from outside the immediate neighborhood in which the adult establishment is located. 
The City Council further finds, based upon a March 3, 1986, study conducted by the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Community Development Department entitled "Adult Entertainment Businesses in Oklahoma City - A Survey of Real Estate Appraisers", that an adult establishment will have a negative effect on residential property market values if it is located closer than one block to residential uses. 
The City Council further finds that the regulation of adult establishments was carefully considered by a work group of Fulton County staff drawn from the areas of law enforcement, land use, land planning, and law; by the Planning Commission at public meetings open to the citizens of Sandy Springs where public comment was available; and by a committee of citizens with expertise in law, real estate, land use, and other disciplines, who have reviewed the effects of adult establishments on market values of residential and other property, and that the information gathered and results of this informal study support the need for these development standards. 
This portion of the zoning ordinance is intended to be a carefully tailored regulation to minimize the adverse land use impacts caused by the undesirable secondary effects of adult establishments, and the City Council finds that restricting adult establishments to certain zones and imposing development standards can legitimately regulate adult establishments by establishing zones where adult establishments are least incompatible with other uses or the surrounding neighborhood, and by requiring minimum distances to be maintained between adult establishments and other uses so as to afford the most protection to residential uses. 
It is not the intent of the City Council, in enacting this portion to the zoning ordinance, to deny to any person rights to speech protected by the United States or Georgia Constitutions, nor is it the intent to impose any additional limitations or restrictions on the contents of any communicative materials, including sexually-oriented films, videotapes, books, or other materials; further, in the adoption of this amendment to the zoning ordinance, the City Council does not intend to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain or view any sexually oriented materials protected by the United States or Georgia Constitutions, nor does it intend to restrict or deny any constitutionally protected rights that distributors or exhibitors of such sexually-oriented materials may have to sell, distribute, or exhibit such constitutionally protected materials; finally, in the enactment of this portion of the zoning ordinance, the City Council intends to adopt a content neutral measure to address the secondary effects of adult establishments in continuation of practices that previously applied to the citizens of the now incorporated City of Sandy Springs as when they were formerly citizens residing in unincorporated Fulton County. 
The City Council hereby re-adopts and incorporates these pre-enactment findings and evidence into the adoption of the following code amendments.

Sec. 8.3.19. - Sign Measurements 
A.  Computation of Sign Area The area of all signs is determined as follows: 
1.  For wall signs, awning signs, canopy signs and crown signs consisting of freestanding letters or logos, sign area is calculated as the total area of the rectangle, circle or square that fully encloses all the letters or images. 

2.  For signs on a background, the entire area of the background is calculated as sign area, including any material or color forming the sign face and the background used to differentiate the sign from the structure on which it is mounted. For monument signs, projecting signs, shingle signs and sidewalk signs, sign area includes the face of the structure that the message is affixed to, not including any supports, bracing or street number. 

3.  The sign area of a three-dimensional sign is calculated as total area of the smallest rectangle, circle or square that fully encloses the largest profile of the three-dimensional sign. 

4.  The area for a sign with more than one face is computed by adding together the area of all sign faces greater than 60 degrees; if the sign face angle is less than 60 degrees, only the area of the largest sign face is computed as part of the sign area. 

B.  Measurement of Sign Height The total height of a monument sign is measured from the highest point of the sign or supporting structure to the top of the abutting sidewalk. 

C.  Sign Variances The Board of Appeals will not consider any variance to either sign area or sign height. For all other relief, see Div. 11.6.

These requirements are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer and setback requirements established under state law, and approval of or exemption from these requirements does not constitute approval of or exemption from buffer and setback requirements established under state law or from other applicable local, state or federal regulations. 
B.  Legal Nonconforming Structures This Division does not apply to the following existing structures: 
1.  Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land that is zoned and approved for such use on or before December 12, 2005. 
2.  Existing development and ongoing land disturbance activities including but not limited to existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance, except that new development or land disturbance activities on such properties will be subject to all applicable buffer and setback requirements. 
3.  A variance from the requirements of the Sandy Springs portion of any state waters buffer or additional impervious surface setback (see Sec. 9.2.4) is not required for: 
a.  Repair or replacement in kind of any legally approved principal structure located in the buffer or setback that existed prior to December 12, 2005, provided that the footprint of the pre-2005 structure is not exceeded and engineering analysis indicates that no rise in flood elevation will occur. All required permits are still necessary prior to construction. 
b.  Removal of a principal or accessory structure or otherwise reducing the amount of impervious surface in the state waters buffer or the setback, provided the state waters buffer is restored using native vegetation in accordance with revegetation standards in "Buffer Zone," starting on page 6-15 of the GSWCC's Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia: 2016 Edition. All required permits are still necessary prior to demolition. 
C.  Exemptions The following specific activities are exempt from this Division. Exemption of these activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property. 
1.  Activities for the purpose of building one of the following: 
a.  A stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route or utility line; 
b.  Public water supply intake or public wastewater outfall structures; 
c.  Intrusions necessary to provide access to a property; 
d.  Public access facilities that must be on the water including boat ramps, docks, foot trails leading directly to the river, fishing platforms and overlooks; 
e.  Unpaved foot trails and paths; 
f.  Activities to restore and enhance stream bank stability, vegetation, water quality or aquatic habitat, so long as native vegetation and bioengineering techniques are used. 
2.  Public sewer line easements paralleling the stream, except that all easements (permanent and construction) and land disturbance should be at least 25 feet from the top of the bank. This includes such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. This exemption must not be construed as allowing the construction of roads, bike paths or other transportation routes in such easements, regardless of paving material, except for access for the uses as specifically cited in paragraph 1 above. 
3.  Land development activities within a right-of-way existing on December 12, 2005 or approved under the terms of this Division. 
4.  Within an easement of any utility existing on December 12, 2005 or approved under the terms of this Division, land disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. 
5.  Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is performed under this Division, the person performing it must report such work to the City on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within 10 days, the person must apply for a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the City to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability or water quality of the protection area. 
6.  Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural uses and are not incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer or setback that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for 3 years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer or setback. 
7.  Projects defined in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(3) as minor land-disturbing activities that are exempt from the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act: "Such minor land-disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion." 
D.  Minor Land Disturbing Activities The following land-disturbing activities are examples of projects not specifically listed in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(3) that would be considered minor land-disturbing activities and are, therefore, exempt from the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act and the applicable buffer requirements for state waters: 
1.  Elevated structures such as decks, gazebos, patios, walkways, viewing platforms or open picnic shelters, provided that: 
a.  The floor or decking is built in a pervious manner to allow for the infiltration of stormwater; 
b.  No more than 100 square feet of footprint of the elevated structure extends into or over the buffer, with an exception for structures compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); 
c.  No grading, cutting, filling or similar land-disturbing activities occurring as a part of the site preparation, construction or subsequent development; 
d.  The structure is built on posts, concrete blocks or similar supports; 
e.  Permanent protective vegetative cover remains or protective measures (for example, mulch or gravel) are installed within the footprint of the elevated structure to prevent post-construction soil erosion; 
f.  A natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and 
g.  No concrete or asphalt slabs, pads or foundations are constructed or placed as a part of the site preparation, construction or subsequent development. 
2.  A pervious ground-level walkway approach to a dock or similar structure, provided that: 
a.  No more than 100 square feet of the constructed walkway extends into the buffer, with an exception for structures compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); 
b.  No grading, cutting, filling or similar land-disturbing activities occur as a part of the site preparation, construction or subsequent development; 
c.  No concrete or asphalt slabs, pads, supports or foundations are constructed or placed as a part of the site preparation, construction or subsequent development; and 
d.  All ground preparation and walkway material placement is completed with the use of hand-held equipment. 
3.  Restoration of buffer area after the removal of an existing structure, provided that the buffer area must be replanted with native vegetation. 
4.  Maintenance or repair of existing structures, the failure of which would result in a threat to human health or state waters, such as sewer lines, water lines, dams or gas lines. Total disturbance must be less than 100 square feet. 
5.  Placement of rock riprap within the buffer not to exceed 100 square feet on any one property, provided that: 
a.  The placement of the riprap does not result in soil disturbance outside the placement area; and 
b.  No grading, cutting, filling or similar land-disturbing activities occur as part of the site preparation, construction or subsequent development. 
E.  Activities Not Considered Minor The following land-disturbing activities are examples of projects that are not considered minor land-disturbing activities and are, therefore, not exempt from the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act and the applicable buffer requirements for state waters: 
1.  Any land-disturbing activity utilizing wheeled or tracked machinery and equipment resulting in soil erosion within the buffer; 
a.  Paving with poured or prefab concrete or asphalt; 
b.  Any project or combination of projects occurring within the same calendar year on the same property resulting in more than 100 square feet of any elevated structures or pervious ground level walkways within or extending into the buffer;

F.  Prohibited Activity Any land development activity within a buffer established under this Division or any impervious cover within a setback established under this Division is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to Sec. 9.2.4.B and Sec. 11.6.2. 
( Ord. of 4-17-2018(7) , §§ 9-4—9-10) 
Sec. 9.2.3. - Inspections 
A.  The Department may cause inspections of the work in the buffer or setback to be made periodically during the course thereof and must make a final inspection following completion of the work. The permittee must assist the Department in making such inspections. The Department has the authority to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as prescribed in this Division, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable time upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigating and inspecting the sites of any land development activities within the protection area. 
B.  No person may refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent who requests entry for purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor may any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out official duties. 
Sec. 9.2.4. - Land Development Requirements 
A.  Buffer and Setback Requirements All land development activity subject to this Division must meet the following requirements: 
1.  An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer is maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on all banks of the state waters as measured from the point of wrested vegetation. 
2.  An additional setback is maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover is prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving must be minimized within the setback. Staff will consider the concept of minimized according to the following criteria: 
a.  Design constraints exist due to the size, shape or topography of the land that render the proposed grading, filling or earthmoving in the setback as the minimum possible to perform the necessary construction activity; and 
b.  The post-development slope is no greater than 4:1 at any point within the setback, OR post-construction conditions (infiltration and velocity) are comparable to an improvement over the preconstruction conditions. 
3.  No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields are permitted within the buffer or the setback. Septic tanks and septic tank drain fields must be coordinated with the Fulton County Health Department and comply with its regulations. 
B.  Variance Procedures Variances from paragraph A. above may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
1.  Where a parcel was platted prior to December 12, 2005, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this Division, and the City finds and determines that the requirements of this Division prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the Board of Appeals may grant a variance from paragraph A. above, provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
2.  The Board of Appeals will follow the procedure set forth in Sec. 11.6.2. 
3.  Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
a.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing on December 12, 2005 prevents land development unless a buffer or setback variance is granted. 
b.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer and setback requirements in this Division would create an extreme hardship. 
4.  Variances will not be considered when actions of any property owner of a given property after December 12, 2005 have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
5.  At a minimum, a variance request must include the following information: 
a.  A site map that includes locations of all state waters, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
b.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
c.  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer and setback to be affected is accurately and clearly indicated; 
d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer and setback be maintained; 
e.  At least one alternative plan that does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and 
h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
6.  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
b.  The locations of all state waters, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features on the property, including along property boundaries, as determined by field survey; 
c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; 
d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
e.  The long-term and water quality impacts of the proposed variance; and 
f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment. 
( Ord. of 4-17-2018(7) , §§ 9-11, 9-12) 
Sec. 9.2.5. - Compatibility with Other Buffers 
A.  This Division is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other chapter, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. The requirements of this Division should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this Division imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other chapter, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment are considered to take precedence. 
B.  Additional standards that apply and will be enforced by the City are as follows: 
1.  Metropolitan River Protection Act and Chattahoochee Corridor Plan: 
a.  Requires a 50-foot undisturbed vegetative buffer; 
b.  Requires a 150-foot impervious surface setback on the Chattahoochee and its impoundments; and 
c.  Requires a 35-foot undisturbed vegetative buffer (all measured from the edge of the water) on perennial tributary streams in a corridor extending 2,000 feet from either bank of the river and its impoundments. 
d.  The corridor extends from Buford Dam to the downstream limits of the Atlanta region (Douglas and Fulton Counties). Streams in the basin of the Corridor are required to be protected by buffers, but no required width is specified. (O.C.G.A. § 12-5-440 et seq.) 
2.  DNR Part 5 Criteria for small (under 100 square miles) water supply watersheds: 
a.  Authorized under O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, these criteria require 100-foot undisturbed buffers and 150-foot setbacks on all perennial streams within seven miles upstream of a public water supply reservoir or public water supply intake. 
b.  Beyond 7 miles, the required buffer is 50 feet and the required setback is 75 feet. Equivalent protection measures may be adopted with approval from the state Department of community affairs and the Department of natural resources (DCA and DNR). 
3.  DNR Part 5 Criteria for river protection authorized under the Metropolitan River Protection Act, these criteria require a 100-foot buffer along rivers with average annual flows of greater than 400 cubic feet per second (cfs) excepting the portion of the Chattahoochee referenced in subsection (1) of this section. The buffer is measured from the top of the stream bank. 
4.  Other such state and federal regulations as may be adopted from time to time. While the requirements of this Division are intended to apply to all state waters in the City, special conditions may exist that require greater protection. Nothing in this Division should be construed as preventing the establishment of wider and/or more restrictive buffers and setbacks as required under any other existing or future legislation. In addition, nothing in this Division should be construed as preventing the establishment of wider buffers or setbacks for purposes of protecting greenspace, preserving habitat or other goals that may not be specifically mandated by legislation.

Sec. 9.3.4. - Boundary Tree 
A.  Boundary Tree means a tree 10 inches DBH or larger located on a property adjacent to a permitting property whose critical root zone or canopy extends into that permitting property. 
B.  Where a Tree Removal Permit is required for a Boundary Tree, the City Arborist must determine whether the proposed land disturbance or construction activity will deprive the Boundary Tree of continued viability. 
1.  If there is not sufficient evidence to show that the proposed activity will deprive the Boundary Tree of continued viability, the Tree Removal Permit may be issued allowing the proposed activity. 
2.  If there is sufficient evidence to show that the proposed activity will deprive the Boundary Tree of continued viability, the Tree Removal Permit must not be issued in a manner allowing the proposed activity relating to the Boundary Tree. 
C.  If the City Arborist determines that it is uncertain whether the proposed land disturbance or construction activity will deprive the Boundary Tree of continued viability, prior to the issuance of a Tree Removal Permit allowing the proposed activity relating to the Boundary Tree: 
1.  The applicant must provide two or more estimates from professionals that are determined to be sufficient to offset the removal and replacement costs of the Boundary Tree, and an average will be used to determine the amount of funds the applicant must provide into an account established by the City. Notice must be provided to the property owner whose property contains the Boundary Tree and must include notice of the deposited funds and a copy of this Section. 
2.  In establishing the escrow amount required pursuant to Sec. 9.3.8.F, the proposed replacement tree upon which payment is computed must be comparable to the Boundary Tree in species and size potential, be ecologically compatible with the intended growing site, and at maturity fully mitigate the loss of the entire canopy area of the Boundary Tree. 
3.  For the purposes of this section, credit will be granted to applicants for the entire tree canopy of a Boundary Tree protected, as calculated pursuant to the Technical Manual. 
( Ord. of 4-17-2018(7) , § 9-21) 
Sec. 9.3.5. - Setback Tree 
A.  Setback Tree means a tree 18 inches DBH or larger located in the minimum required setbacks of any property. 
B.  The City Arborist may decide to approve the removal of a Setback Tree by weighing the following factors: 
1.  The size and configuration of the property; 
2.  The physical condition of the tree; 
3.  The total tree canopy on the property;

Div. 9.4. - Natural Grade Protection[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note— An ordinance adopted April 17, 2018(7) , § 9-32, changed the title of Div. 9.4 from "Steep Slopes" to read as herein set out. 

Sec. 9.4.1. - Purpose 
A.  The purpose of this Division is to protect topographic features and natural grades in order to prevent one or more of the following negative impacts: 
1.  Erosion affecting the structural integrity of steep slopes and natural grades. 
2.  Stormwater and erosion-related impacts on adjacent properties. 
3.  Stormwater and erosion-related impacts to environmentally sensitive areas. 
4.  Increased stormwater velocity due to loss of vegetation. 
5.  Decreased groundwater recharge due to changes in site hydrology. 
6.  Loss of natural or topographic features that contribute substantially to the natural beauty and visual quality of the community. 
B.  The standards of this Division do not apply to steep slopes in the CS- or Perimeter Center Districts. 
( Ord. of 4-17-2018(7) , § 9-33) 
Sec. 9.4.2. - Standards 
A.  Definition For purposes of this Division, "slope" means the ratio of elevation change to horizontal distance, expressed as a percentage. Slope is computed by dividing the vertical distance ("rise") by the horizontal distance ("run"). For example, a 3-foot rise in a 20-foot run results in a 15% slope. 
B.  Applicability All construction, including renovations and additions, must comply with the requirements of this Division. 
C.  Designation on Plans Moderate and steep slopes of 1,000 square feet and greater in area must be designated on any Land Disturbance Permit or Building Permit application. 
D.  Moderate Slopes of 15% and Up to 35% Building and site preparation may occur upon demonstration of specialized site design techniques and approaches that meet the requirements in F. below. 
E.  Steep Slopes of 35% or Greater These areas are generally unsuitable for development. Land disturbance must not exceed ¼ of the area containing slopes of 35% or greater in areas of 1,000 square feet or more, except that where an existing lot of record does not have a reasonable building site with less than 35% slope or natural grade, the Director may approve the site, subject to any necessary mitigation measures. 
F.  Construction Techniques Construction activities on slopes of 15% or greater must comply with the following: 
1.  All plans must show provisions for reducing and minimizing stormwater runoff during construction on steep slopes and cut and fill slopes. 
2.  All swales and all slopes must be provided temporary or permanent stabilization with ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion as soon as practicable, but in any event, within 7 calendar days of any phase of grading. 
3.  All other disturbed areas must be provided temporary or permanent stabilization with ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion as soon as practicable, but in any event, within 14 calendar days of termination or completion of any phase of grading. 
4.  Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, vegetation must be reestablished. 
5.  Where irrigation is not provided, the exposed soil must be planted with species that survive without irrigation. 
6.  Vegetative ground cover or any alternative cover (rock, masonry, or similar materials) must be maintained in perpetuity. 
G.  Grading In order to protect trees and vegetation on sites, and to protect the character of the neighborhood, the following limits on grading are required. 
1.  Mitigation measures Any grading in side and rear building setbacks in RE-, RD- and RU- districts, must be mitigated following the measures listed below. 
a.  For each tree of 10 inches DBH or greater removed or damaged by grading in the side setback, one tree must be planted; 
b.  If no tree of 10 inches DBH or greater is removed or damaged, at least one large canopy shade tree must be planted for every 1,000 square feet of area disturbed in the side setback; 
c.  Replacement tree species must be of comparable canopy size at maturity as those of the trees removed or damaged; 
d.  Replacement trees must be at least 2 inches caliper at time of planting; 
e.  Planting must take place in the graded area. If this is not possible, the replacement trees may be located elsewhere on the property. If this is not possible, recompense provisions (see Sec. 9.3.8) of the Tree Ordinance apply; 
f.  This mitigation is required in addition to any other provisions of the Tree Ordinance, including those that apply to Setback Trees (see Sec. 9.3.5). 
2.  In the side building setbacks   
a.  In all RE- districts, grading may encroach up to 10 feet into the required side building setbacks. 
b.  In all RD- and RU- districts, grading may encroach into the required side building setbacks. 
3.  In the rear building setbacks   
a.  In all RE- districts, no grading is allowed within 20 feet of the rear lot line. 
b.  In the RD-27, RD-18, and RD-15 districts, no grading is allowed within 15 feet of the rear lot line. 
c.  In the RD-12, RD-9, RD-7.5, and RU- districts, no grading is allowed within 10 feet of the rear lot line. 
4.  In all districts, resulting graded slopes must not exceed 3 feet (horizontal) to 1 foot (vertical). Steeper slopes may be approved by the Director upon certification of stability by a soils engineer or geologist. 
H.  Variance from Standards In granting a variance from the standards of this Section, the Board of Appeals may determine that some features or areas may not be disturbed. These include, but are not limited to: 
1.  Large stands of trees; 
2.  Areas containing state waters, floodplain, or wetlands or in the Nancy Creek Declared Sensitive Area; 
3.  Rock outcroppings; and 
4.  Slopes of 35% or greater.

Sec. 9.4.3. - Retaining Walls 
A.  Design   
1.  Applicants are encouraged to use building foundations as retaining walls to retain slopes. There is no limit on the height of building foundation walls serving as retaining walls, provided the resulting building does not exceed the district height standards. 
2.  Where retaining walls are necessary, they are limited as follows: 
a.  Retaining walls must be separated horizontally by at least 4 feet from other retaining walls. This horizontal separation area must be graded to capture stormwater and not sloped such that stormwater will run off. 
b.  Each tier between retaining walls must be vegetated and maintained with a mix of native, evergreen and deciduous shrubs, to be approved by the City Arborist, as follows: 
i.  One shrub every 4 linear feet; and 
ii.  The Director may waive this landscaping standard for retaining walls that slope back and contain natural planting. 
B.  Measurement   
1.  Total retaining wall height is considered to be the vertical distance between finished grade level at the front of the wall and the grade level at the back of the wall at the same section. 
2.  Any portion of a retaining wall extending above the finished grade is considered to be a fence or wall, subject to the requirements of Sec. 8.2.10. 
C.  Maintenance and Replacement Existing legally permitted and constructed retaining walls may be maintained and repaired, provided the maintenance and repair do not result in an increase in the height of the wall. 
D.  In RE-, RD- and RU- Districts In order to protect trees and vegetation on sites and to protect the character of the neighborhood, the following standards apply to all lots in RE-, RD- and RU- Districts. 
1.  In the side building setbacks: 
a.  In all RE- districts, retaining walls may encroach up to 10 feet into required side building setbacks. 
b.  In all RD- districts, retaining walls may encroach up to half the depth of the required side building setbacks. 
c.  In all RU- districts, no encroachment for retaining walls is allowed into the required side building setbacks. 
2.  In the rear building setbacks: 
a.  In all RE- Districts, no retaining walls are allowed within 20 feet of the rear lot line. 
b.  In the RD-27, RD-18, and RD-15 districts, no retaining walls are allowed within 15 feet of the rear lot line. 
c.  In the RD-12, RD-9, RD-7.5, and RU- districts, no retaining walls are allowed within 10 feet of the rear lot line. 
3.  Newly constructed retaining walls are subject to the following requirements: 
a.  Up to 6 feet in height as a single wall or tiered walls. 
b.  Over 6 feet in height requires tiered retaining walls (each not to exceed 6 feet in height). 
c.  Wing walls (retaining walls that allow daylighting of a basement) are permitted to be up to 12 feet in height if they are inward facing and finished with durable materials (stucco, brick, or stone). If they are to encroach into the building setbacks, the wing walls have to be a maximum of 6 feet in height and meet the retaining wall setback requirements above. 
E.  In All Other Districts The following standards apply to all districts other than those addressed in Sec. 9.4.3.D. 
1.  Newly constructed retaining walls are subject to the following requirements: 
a.  Up to 8 feet in height as a single wall or tiered walls. 
b.  Over 8 feet in height requires tiered retaining walls (each not to exceed 8 feet in height), which require a building permit. 
F.  Materials All retaining walls must be finished with stucco, brick or stone. With approval of the Director, architectural segmented or modular block walls may be approved. No unfinished concrete masonry units or other similar materials are allowed. 
G.  Permits and Indemnification   
1.  Retaining walls over 4 feet in height require a retaining wall permit and an indemnification. 
2.  Retaining walls over 6 feet in height require a professional engineer's certification regarding the design of the wall. 
3.  A retaining wall permit is required where an assemblage of tiered retaining walls and slopes results in an excess of a 2:1 slope. 
4.  Where a retaining wall of any height supports a surcharge, a retaining wall permit may be required by the Director. Surcharge is any vertical load imposed on the retained soil that may impose a lateral force in addition to the lateral earth pressure of the retained soil. Examples of surcharges include: 
a.  Sloping retaining soil; 
b.  Structure footings supported by the retained soil; 
c.  Adjacent vehicle loads supported by the retained soil. 
5.  During the permit review process, the global stability of any series of tiered retaining walls will be reviewed. A safety factor of at least 1.5 is required. 
6.  Where a retaining wall might impact (either visually or structurally) an existing structure, adjacent property, a street, a buffer, a utility, or other similar significant interest, the Director may require plans, details, cross-sections, and professional engineer calculations beyond those cited in this Section.

Sec. 9.5.1. - In General 
A.  Purpose The purpose of this Division is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
1.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
2.  Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
3.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
4.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
5.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
6.  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; and 
7.  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas. 
B.  Applicability This Division shall be applicable to all areas of special flood hazard within the City. For the purposes of defining and determining areas of special flood hazard, areas of future-conditions flood hazard, areas of shallow flooding, base flood elevations, floodplains, floodways, future-conditions floodplains, potential flood hazard or risk categories as shown on FIRM maps, and other such terms used in this Division, the following documents and sources may be used for such purposes and are adopted by reference thereto: 
1.  The flood insurance study (FIS) for the county, dated May 7, 2001, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto. 
2.  Other studies which may be relied upon for the establishment of the base flood elevation or delineation of the base or one-percent (100-year) floodplain and floodprone areas, including: 
3.  Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey, or any other local, state or federal agency applicable to the City; and

Sec. 9.5.3. - Development Standards 
A.  Definition of Floodplain Boundaries   
1.  "A" zones, as identified in the FIS, are used to establish base flood elevations. 
2.  For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the future-conditions flood elevations are provided by the City. If future-conditions elevation data is not available from the City, then it is determined by a licensed professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the City. 
B.  Definition of Floodway Boundaries The width of a floodway is determined from the FIS or FEMA-approved flood study. For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the regulatory floodway is provided by the City. If floodway data is not available from the City, then it is determined by a licensed professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the City. 
C.  General Standards   
1.  No development shall be allowed within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard that could result in any of the following: 
a.  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
b.  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions regulatory flood storage capacity; 
c.  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the property; or 
d.  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
2.  Any development within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard allowed under Sec. 9.5.3.C.1 shall also meet the following conditions: 
a.  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average groundwater table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average groundwater table elevation and the future-conditions flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and is within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation: 
i.  Include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain; 
ii.  Storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
b.  Cut areas are stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than two percent; 
c.  Effective transitions are provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
d.  Verification of no-rise conditions (0.01 foot or less), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics are provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of Sec. 9.5.3.D; 
e.  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from floodwaters; and 
f.  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain is submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal is subject to approval by the Department using the FEMA community concurrence forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval is the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of development, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys and plans for a final letter of map revision (LOMR). 
D.  Engineering Study Requirements for Floodplain Encroachments An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and floodways. This study is prepared by a licensed professional engineer and made a part of the application for a permit. This information is submitted to and approved by the Department prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include all requirements specified in the Sandy Springs Technical Manual: 
1.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
2.  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the Department. Cross sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles and future-conditions flood profiles; 
3.  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
4.  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments. 
E.  Floodway Encroachments Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in [subsection] (2) below. 
2.  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment will not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
3.  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway is issued by the City until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA or a no-rise certification is approved by the Department. 
F.  Maintenance Requirements The property owner is responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on the property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is maintained. The City may direct the property owner, at no cost to the City, to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the Department.

Div. 9.6. - Stormwater Management 

Sec. 9.6.1. - Purpose 
The purpose of this Division is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment by focusing on the types of frequently occurring storm events that generate the most water quality impacts. Proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This Division seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
A.  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
B.  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, non-point source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
C.  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality and to preserve and/or restore natural hydrologic conditions on development sites; 
D.  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
E.  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, peak rate and/or runoff reduction, and the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, by establishing minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the City's greenspace protection plan; 
F.  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility of operation, inspection, maintenance and repair of private structural stormwater control facilities and private commitments for nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety or the environment; 
G.  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term compliance; and 
H.  Protect public health and safety by reducing the risk of localized flooding and reducing the amount of runoff entering streets.

Sec. 9.6.12. - Performance Criteria 
A.  For new developments, the following performance criteria shall be applied to the area of the site impacted by the proposed work. For redevelopment, the following performance criteria shall be applied to the area of the site impacted by the proposed work, provided that the impacted area does not exceed 35 percent of the previously developed area. If the impacted area exceeds 35 percent of the previously developed area, the following performance criteria shall be applied to the entire development, including previously developed area: 
1.  Water Quality All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if it satisfies the stormwater reduction criteria in this section. However if any of the stormwater runoff volume generated by the first 1.2 inches of rainfall cannot be reduced or retained on site due to constraints such as a high water table, rock, low infiltration rates or the presence of a hotspot, the remaining volume shall be increased by a multiplier of 1.2 and shall be intercepted and treated in one or more stormwater management practices that provide at least an 80 percent reduction in total suspended solids loads in accordance with the following criteria: 
a.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
b.  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual or constitutes an alternative practice responsibly designed and documented by the design professional to reproduce the intent of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and 
c.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the Department are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
2.  Stream Channel Protection Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation is provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
a.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
b.  Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; 
c.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
d.  For redevelopment projects that create, add, or demolish and replace less than 5,000 square feet of impervious surface and meet the performance criteria of this section, stream channel protection is not required. 
3.  Overbank Flooding Protection   
a.  Downstream overbank flood and property protection is provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under subsection (a) of this section is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. For redevelopment projects overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by reducing the peak discharge rate up to the 25-year, 24-hour storm event in accordance with the following formula: 
b.  %PIC/2 = %PDRR 
c.  PIC = Predevelopment Impervious Cover 
i.  PDRR = Peak Discharge Rate Reduction 
d.  For sites where previous demolition has removed impervious surfaces, pre-development peak discharge rate calculations and percentage of impervious coverage shall be calculated based on pre-demolition conditions. For sites that have been demolished and have remained fallow and stabilized with vegetation for a minimum of five years, they shall be considered as having pre-development conditions of 20 percent impervious cover for purposes of calculating peak discharge rate reduction. 
e.  For land development permitted after 2005 and served by appropriate stormwater management facilities, subsequent redevelopment of the same area is not required to further reduce the peak discharge rate, provided that the site continues to meet the reduction previously achieved. 
f.  For redevelopment projects that create, add, or demolish and replace less than 5,000 square feet of impervious surface and meet the performance criteria of this section, overbank flooding protection is not required. 
4.  Extreme Flooding Protection   
a.  Extreme flood and public safety protection is provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
b.  For redevelopment projects that create, add, or demolish and replace less than 5,000 square feet of impervious surface and meet the performance criteria of this section, extreme flooding protection is not required. 
5.  Structural Stormwater Controls All structural stormwater management facilities are selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the Department before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the City may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased non-point source pollution loads created on the site in question. Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
6.  Stormwater Credits for Nonstructural Measures The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under Sec. 9.6.12.A.1. The applicant may, if approved by the Department, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements that identifies the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
7.  Drainage System Guidelines Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catchbasins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutters, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters, are provided when necessary for the protection of right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more than one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements:

Div. 9.7. - Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control 

Sec. 9.7.1. - Title and Findings 
A.  Title This Division will be known as "The City of Sandy Springs Soil Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Ordinance." 
B.  Findings The City of Sandy Springs finds that soil erosion and sediment deposition onto land and into water within the watersheds of the City are a result of failure to apply proper soil erosion and sedimentation control practices in land clearing, soil movement, and construction activities and that such erosion and sediment deposition result in pollution of state waters and damage to domestic, agricultural, recreational, fish and wildlife, and other resource uses. It is therefore declared to be the policy of the City of Sandy Springs and the intent of this Division to strengthen and extend the present erosion and sediment control activities and programs of the City of Sandy Springs and to provide for the establishment and implementation of a City-wide comprehensive soil erosion and sediment control program to conserve and protect the land, water, air, and other resources of the City of Sandy Springs.

( Ord. of 4-17-2018(7) , §§ 9-75—9-81) 
Sec. 9.7.3. - Minimum Requirements 
A.  General Provisions Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance [from which this Division derived] and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities that are not exempted by this Division shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of Sec. 9.7.3.B and Sec. 9.7.3.C of this Division. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this Division and the NPDES general permit. 
B.  Minimum Requirements/BMPs   
1.  Best management practices as set forth in this section of this Division shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the Director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with Sec. 9.7.3.B.2 or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this section, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
2.  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the Director, EPD. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
3.  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
4.  The Director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board of Natural Resources, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
5.  The local issuing authority (LIA) may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in Sec. 9.7.3.C.15 and Sec. 9.7.3.C.16, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
C.  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
1.  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
2.  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
3.  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
4.  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
5.  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
6.  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
7.  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
8.  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
9.  To the extent necessary, sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
10.  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
11.  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
12.  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
13.  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
14.  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in Sec. 9.7.3.B.2 of this Division; 
15.  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the Director, EPD determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the Director, EPD pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which groundwater is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the Director, EPD as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; 
16.  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the Board of Natural Resources, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The Director, EPD may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the streambed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
17.  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in Sec. 9.7.3.B and Sec. 9.7.3.C of this Division. 
18.  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this Division or the terms of the permit. 
( Ord. of 4-17-2018(7) , §§ 9-82—9-89) 
Sec. 9.7.4. - Application/Permit Process 
A.  General The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this Division, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit.

The improvements and associated lands must be provided at no cost to the City, and must be dedicated or otherwise transferred, as required, to the public in perpetuity and without covenant or reservation, except as otherwise provided in this Division. 
B.  Arrangement of Lots When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels must be arranged and designed to allow for the opening of future streets and to provide access to those areas not presently served by streets. 
C.  Access to Adjacent Properties No subdivision or development may be designed to completely eliminate street access to adjoining parcels of land. Every development must be designed to facilitate access to adjoining properties which are developed or anticipated to be developed in a manner substantially similar to the subject property. 
D.  Cross-Access Easement In the RM- District, any Corridors & Nodes district or Perimeter Center district, the property owner must grant a cross-access easement as described in this Section to each adjoining property that is in the RM-District, any Corridors & Nodes district or Perimeter Center district, unless a street is provided as required in Sec. 10.3.1. The purpose of the easement is to facilitate movement of customers and their vehicles from establishment to establishment (lot to lot) without generating additional turning movements on a public street. When required by this Section, cross-access easements must be recorded in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court, Fulton County, and reference to deed book and copy of the recorded easement provided to the Director. 
1.  Access Easement Provisions

b.  On-site parking spaces may be restricted to use by the owner's customers and tenants only. 
c.  Upon the availability of access to driveways and parking areas of the adjoining lot, the pavement or other surfacing of the owner's driveways and parking areas must be extended to the point of access on the property line. 
d.  Where cross-access arrangements exist that predate the provisions of this Ordinance, this access may not be blocked by any party, 
2.  Location of Cross-Access Connections The location of vehicular connections across a property line should be mutually determined and constructed by both property owners. In the case of coordination problems or any factors preventing construction of a cross-access connection, the Director will determine the location of the connection to be constructed by property owners. 
3.  Stub When an abutting owner refuses in writing to allow construction of the cross-access circulation on their property, a stub for future cross-access must be provided as close as possible to the common property line. 
4.  Relief   
a.  The Director may grant relief from this cross-access requirement, in whole or in part, provided the relief is deemed reasonable due to one or more of the following: 
i.  Topographic changes are too steep; 
ii.  The presence of existing buildings, a stream or other natural features; 
iii.  Site layout of developed properties; 
iv.  Adjoining uses or their vehicles are incompatible; or 
v.  Strict compliance would pose a safety hazard. 
b.  When cross-access is waived by the Director, bicycle and pedestrian connections must be provided between abutting properties, except where there is a stream crossing greater than 15 feet in width that interferes with such access. 
E.  Vehicular Access to Lots ..... All lots must provide vehicular access directly from a public street along the frontage or along another property line that abuts a public street.

Permit Review Generalized Procedure
4.  A minor Land Disturbance Permit is required for projects that: 
a.  Do not include any work in the right-of-way; or 
b.  Have less than half an acre of disturbance; 
c.  And/or are adding less than 5,000 square feet of impervious surface;

4.  Traffic Impact Study A traffic impact study is required when any development generates 100 or more trips during the peak hour. 
5.  Director Review   
a.  If, after the internal and external review, the Director finds that the application does not meet all applicable requirements of this Development Code, the Director will notify the applicant in writing of the specific provisions that have not been met and offer the applicant the opportunity to make changes to the application. If revised application materials are required, see Sec. 11.2.3.E. 
b.  If, after the internal and external review, the Director finds that the application meets all applicable requirements of this Development Code, the Director will accept the application as complete. 
F.  Approval Criteria The approval of or requirement of revisions to a land disturbance permit application are based solely on whether or not the submittal meets or fails to meet the applicable requirements of this Development Code. 
G.  Denied Application If unsatisfied with the Director's decision, the applicant may file an appeal within 30 calendar days of the decision with the Board of Appeals. 
H.  Permit Revisions Revisions to an approved Land disturbance permit may be approved by the Director following review by applicable internal and external agencies consistent with this Section. 
I.  Application Expiration An application submitted for a land disturbance permit expires after 6 months from the issuance of the latest letter of permit revisions. At this time, the City will issue a written notice of expiration of permit application to the applicant and require that comments be addressed or permit be resubmitted within 30 days of issuance of the notice. 
J.  Permit Validity A land disturbance permit remains valid for the duration of the project subject to the following time restrictions:

a.  A delay resulting from court actions involving the land disturbance permit or a previous extension on the subject property for which an extension is sought. Extensions approved in connection with court action shall remain valid for 1 year beyond the granting of an order or the expiration of an appeal period before any court with jurisdiction; 
b.  Nonavailability of utilities resulting from government inaction. In those instances where wastewater and water facilities are available for a fraction of the desired capacity, or when capacity was available at some time during the one-year period, but not during the 60 days prior to expiration, the City Council shall evaluate such case's qualifications for an extension on its individual merits considering any evidence that might indicate a diligent effort to proceed with development. 
c.  A delay in development resulting from wetlands regulatory procedures requires the applicant to provide a copy of the application acknowledgment letter from the Savannah Regulatory Branch of the Corps of Engineers as documented evidence. The application must have been filed at least 6 months before the expiration of the land disturbance permit.

Documentation must consist of two official denials signed by officers of 2 different lending institutions who have final jurisdiction over such financial transactions. 
L.  Lapse in Construction Activity For the purposes of this Section, a lapse in or suspension of development activity, as authorized by a land disturbance permit, as a direct result of action or inaction on the part of the City which is completely beyond the control of the developer, will not be considered as a lapse in activity causing the development permit to expire. The 180 calendar days within which development activity must begin will exclude any such time period during which the activity is prohibited or has been caused to lapse by said City's action or inaction. Any action or inaction on the part of the developer which results in a suspension of development activity will be counted toward the 12-month time period. 
M.  Bonding Infrastructure Improvements Prior to the approval of a Final Plat, a bond is required for right-of-way infrastructure improvements, landscaping and stormwater improvements that have not been installed. The required bond amount will be 125% of the total estimated cost for infrastructure. The City must approve any cost estimate used for bond purposes. The bond will be released upon installation and City approval of the improvements.

( Ord. of 4-17-2018(1) , §§ 11-61, 11-63) 
Sec. 11.6.4. - Beneficial Use Determination 
A.  Purpose The intent of the City is that all landowners in the City enjoy an economically beneficial use of their land. The procedures in this Section are intended to permit landowners who believe they have been deprived of economically beneficial use of their land to apply to the City for relief from application of this Development Code sufficient to provide an economically beneficial use of the land. 
B.  Applicability   
1.  This procedure applies to lots with an unbuilt zoning or site approval originally approved by Fulton County or the City of Sandy Springs, but eliminated by adoption of this Development Code and the new Official Zoning Map. 
2.  If a landowner is of the opinion that the lot's designation on the Official Zoning Map and the regulations of this Development Code have denied economically beneficial use of that landowner's land, then the procedures of this Section must be used prior to seeking relief from the courts in order that any denial of economically beneficial use of land may be remedied through a non-judicial forum. 
C.  Authority The City Council will make determinations of beneficial use following a public hearing on the application at issue. 
D.  Findings In determining if a landowner is deprived of an economically beneficial use of land, the following factors must be taken into account. 
1.  Economically Beneficial Use The uses of the land as provided by this Development Code, and in relation to the uses allowed on similarly situated lands. For the purposes of this Section, "economically beneficial use" means the opportunity to make a return equivalent to that which would have been received from a conservative financial investment. Transitory economic issues are not relevant to this determination. 
2.  Diminution in Value   
a.  The market value of the land, as established by the comparable sales approach, prior to adoption of the regulations that caused the landowner to apply for relief must be compared to the market value of the land, as established by the comparable sales approach, with the regulations as applied. 
b.  Market value of the land prior to the adoption of the regulations that caused the landowner to apply for relief must constitute its highest and best use one day prior to the effective date of the regulations that caused the landowner to apply for relief, or the date of purchase of the land, whichever is later; and any other land value/appraisal information that the applicant would like considered. 
c.  All appraisals must be prepared by qualified licensed appraisers and follow the best professional practices as established by the profession. 
d.  A mere diminution in market value is not sufficient to support a determination of denial of economically beneficial use. 
3.  External Costs The amount or nature of any subsidy that may be required by the City, neighbors, purchasers, tenants, or the public at large if the development allowed under this Development Code is modified; and any other adverse effects on the City and its residents created by the modification of the standards of this Development Code. 
4.  Current State of the Law The state of the law established by the United States Supreme Court, the 11th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals, and the Georgia Supreme Court relevant to these standards. 
E.  Granting of Relief If the City Council finds that a landowner has been deprived economically beneficial use of land or is otherwise entitled to relief in accordance with the standards of this Section, relief must be granted. 
1.  General In granting relief, any legally available incentive or measure reasonably necessary to offset any substantial economic hardship may be adopted, and such incentives may be conditioned upon approval of specific development plans. If there is a finding that the denial of the application would create a substantial economic hardship, additional relief to provide an appropriate increase in market value or other benefit or return to the applicant sufficient to offset the substantial economic hardship may be considered. The types of incentives include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Grant of a beneficial use approval. Such approval must occur in the form of a conceptual master plan and associated development program for the allowed beneficial use. The grant of a beneficial use approval will amend the Comprehensive Plan, if necessary, and create a site-specific designation on the Official Zoning Map linking the conceptual master plan and associated development program with the land. 
b.  An amendment of the Official Zoning Map to a more appropriate zoning classification, issuance of an administrative variance, issuance of a conditional use permit, issuance of a variance, or other appropriate development regulatory action that will enable the applicant to realize a reasonable return on the land; 
c.  A waiver of permit fees; 
d.  Development finance assistance; 
e.  Approval of development on some portion of the land; or 
f.  Acquisition of all or a portion of the land at market value. 
2.  Minimum Increase   
a.  In granting relief, the landowner must be given the minimum increase in use, intensity, or other possible concessions from this Development Code in order to permit an economically beneficial use of the land, or a use that is determined to be required by law. 
b.  The highest use, or even an average or generally reasonable expectation, is not required or intended as the appropriate remedy. 
3.  Guidelines The following guidelines must be used for determining the minimum economically beneficial use of land and, therefore, the amount of relief to be granted a landowner in order to reach that minimum. 
a.  No Governmental Subsidy A minimum economically beneficial use of the land should be one that does not have any governmental subsidy attached to the long-term safe occupation of the land. If such a subsidy is needed, then that should be reflected by lowering the use or intensity that is considered a minimum economically beneficial use on a market valuation basis. 
b.  Common Use A use common to the City, although it may not involve further development of the land, is considered an economically beneficial use. Attention must also be given to land uses that are considered to be the lowest intensity in the City, but which still provide for occupation and living within the City. These land uses, as well, must be considered economically beneficial uses. 
c.  Actual Condition of Land Considered The actual condition of the land must be considered. The reality of limited development potential, given the natural condition of the land, must not be attributed to the regulations applied to the land. If the land is such that it must not safely accommodate development with normal grading and clearing practices, this fact will lower the intensity of use that is considered a minimum economically beneficial use. 
d.  Potential for Damages The potential for damages to either residents or land must be assessed in determining economically beneficial use. The need for a governmental subsidy to future landowners must be considered, and the cost of such subsidies must be deducted from the otherwise established minimum economically beneficial use. 
e.  Only Investment-Backed Expectations Considered Expectations must, in general, not be considered. Only reasonable expectations backed by investments as recognized by the current state of the law will be considered. 
f.  Current State of the Law The current state of law established by the United States Supreme Court, the 11th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals, and the Georgia Supreme Court, relevant to the granting of relief. 
F.  Effect The beneficial use determination does not permit any physical development, use or subdivision that has not been approved pursuant to this Development Code and will not ensure approval of any future application. 
Div. 11.7. - Nonconformities 

Sec. 11.7.1. - Nonconforming Use 
A.  Defined Any use of a building or land lawfully occupied at the time of passage of this Development Code, or any amendment to this Development Code, that does not conform with the use regulations of the zoning district in which it is situated. 
B.  Continuance A nonconforming use is allowed to continue legally even though such use does not conform with the provisions of this Development Code, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  The nonconforming use must not be expanded to occupy a greater area of land or building. 
2.  The nonconforming use must continue in the original building, structure or on land area that was originally occupied by the nonconforming use. 
3.  The nonconforming use will not be reinstated after it has been abandoned. It is considered prima facia evidence of abandonment for the owner and/or operator of the nonconforming use to: 
a.  Discontinue the nonconforming use for 12 months; or 
b.  Fail to obtain a new or renew an existing business license, as required under the City Code, for the operation of such nonconforming use; or 
c.  Fail to declare and remit the sales tax required by State law for the nonconforming use. 
d.  Failure to follow any state, federal or local administrative procedure or regulation that is required for the nonconforming use. 
4.  The nonconforming use must not be changed to another nonconforming use. 
5.  The nonconforming use must maintain any screening or buffering that existed prior to the use becoming a nonconforming use or that was later voluntarily added. 
6.  If the use constitutes a nuisance as defined by state law, the City may revoke the certificate of occupancy or business license if the nuisance cannot be extinguished. 
7.  Nothing in this Section will be construed to allow a use that is dangerous to the general public to continue to exist. 
8.  Nothing in this Section will be construed not to require changes to buildings and structures to comply with any fire code, life safety code or other safety ordinance or regulation. 
9.  Notwithstanding anything in this Div. 11.7 to the contrary, the amortization of any lawful, nonconforming adult establishment use shall continue to be governed by Sec. 26-37 of the City Code. As established in prior judicial decisions, however, there are no lawful, nonconforming adult establishments in the City as of the adoption of this Development Code.

3.  No new nonconformity may be created by any expansion, alteration or rebuilding. 
4.  Expansion on the vertical plane, such as the addition of another story to a nonconforming structure that does not meet the district setback, is considered an expansion of the nonconformity and therefore prohibited. Expansion on the vertical plane in conformance with all the applicable requirements of this Development Code is allowed. 
5.  The nonconforming structure may not be rebuilt, altered or repaired after damage or deterioration exceed 75% of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, except in conformity with this Development Code. Where a residential structure is damaged or destroyed through natural catastrophe, the Director may allow it to be reconstructed without regard to the extent of damage, provided that the extent of any prior structure nonconformity remains the same or is reduced for the new structure. 
6.  A permit to begin such restoration shall be applied for no later than 6 months from the date the damages were incurred. At the request of the applicant, the Director may grant one extension of a maximum of 6 months, upon demonstration of extenuating circumstances outside of the owner's control. The applicant must request an extension in writing, no later than 30 days prior to the expiration of the grace period. 
7.  This section does not apply to signs. See Sec. 11.7.5. 
8.  A request to expand, alter or rebuild an existing nonconforming structure may be brought before the Board of Appeals as a request for a variance.
