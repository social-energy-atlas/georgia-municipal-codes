PREFACE 
The Lamar County Code of Laws consists of two parts: Part I, Local Legislation, being a compilation of local legislation relating to Lamar County adopted by the General Assembly which were deemed advisable to be included; Part II, County Legislation, being a codification of legislation adopted by the Lamar County Board of Commissioners which is of a general and permanent nature. 
As this volume contains three (3) distinct parts, each chapter is preceded by an arabic number designating the part. Thus, the second chapter of Part I (Local Legislation) is Chapter 1-2, and the second chapter of Part II (County Ordinances) is Chapter 2-2. Section numbers are keyed to chapters so the first section of Chapter 1-2 is section 1-2-1 and the first section of Chapter 2-1 is section 2-1-1. 
Under this system each section is identified with its part and chapter number and any additions can be inserted in their proper place by the use of the decimal system. New material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 2-3-2 and 2-3-3 would be designated as sections 2-3-2.1, 2-3-2.2 and 2-3-2.3, respectively. Sections have been reserved at the end of articles and divisions for future expansion. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 2-15 and 2-16 it will be designated as Chapter 2-15.5. New articles and new divisions may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Footnotes which tie related sections of this volume together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations setting forth their location within this volume is included at the back of this volume. The source of each section is indicated by the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables, any local constitutional amendment, local act or ordinance included herein can be readily found in the Code. 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by county officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
The publication of this Code was under the supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Norman Smith, County Attorney, and Mr. Robert Zellner, County Administrator, and to other county officers and employees too numerous to mention, for their invaluable cooperation and assistance in the preparation of the manuscript of this publication.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code and are considered "Included." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code and are considered "Omitted." 
In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note— This part is a compilation of local legislation adopted by the General Assembly relating to Lamar County. In the printing of this legislation a printing style similar to that used in the Lamar County Code (part II) has been used.

DIVISION 6. - RETURN TO WORK PROGRAM 

Sec. 2-2-75.40. - Policy. 
It is the policy of Lamar County to provide and establish a return to work policy and procedure for employees with work-related injuries and illnesses who are unable temporarily and permanently, to return to their permanent job duties. 
Because Lamar County recognizes that their employees are a valued and limited resource, this program is designed to: 
•  Assist the medical recovery process by providing a focus and a goal for return of the injured employee. 
•  Benefit employees by allowing them to return to full wages as soon as possible. 
•  Benefit employer by reducing workers' compensation costs. 
(Mo. of 9-3-02) 
Sec. 2-2-75.41. - Process. 
The county will seek return to work opportunities through the use of transitional employment for all employees who are temporarily disabled due to on-the-job injury as quickly as medically possible. Transitional employment opportunities will be considered in all departments, not just the department in which the injured employee was working before the injury or illness occurred. 
Transitional employment assignments are intended to assist workers who are transitioning back to work after temporary disability that resulted from a work-related injury. All transitional employment duties must be productive. Duties must never be demeaning or appear worthless in any way. 
The county, through its reasonable accommodation program, will make efforts to retain employees who are permanently disabled.

(4)  All emergency purchases made without a prior purchasing order shall be documented by an after-the-fact requisition form, stating that the purchase was made on an emergency basis and the reason for the emergency.

(f)  Inspection and testing . The purchasing agent shall inspect or supervise the inspection of all supplies, materials and equipment on delivery to determine their conformance with the specifications set forth in the purchase order.

(g)  Repairs of equipment. 
(1)  It is recognized that repair and maintenance of equipment cannot be subjected to the same rules as purchase of equipment; however, it shall be the duty of the purchasing agent to exercise discretion in ordering repairs for any county-owned or leased equipment. 
(2)  Where, in the judgment of the purchasing agent, it is not feasible to secure competitive bids for repairs, every effort will be made to secure the lowest possible price for the repair, taking into consideration such factors as whether or not the person or firm offering the service is a Lamar County vendor, whether the service is warranted and for how long, prior experience of the county with the supplier and other factors deemed by the purchasing agent to be of importance. 
(3)  Any repair order which might reasonably be expected to exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) shall receive prior approval of the board of commissioners before issuance of a purchasing order. 
(h)  Professional services. It is recognized that professional services, including but not limited to those of attorneys, physicians, accountants and architects, are not amenable to the bidding process and quality control governing the purchase of supplies, materials and equipment. Therefore, the acquisition of professional services for the county is left to the sound discretion of the board of commissioners. Whenever feasible, professionals residing or working in Lamar County shall be given preference over professionals without connection to Lamar County. 
(i)  Disposal of unserviceable materials, supplies and/or equipment. 
(1)  Subject to the provisions of relevant Georgia law, including O.C.G.A. § 50-16-144, and subject in to the approval of the board of commissioners, the purchasing agent shall be responsible for disposing of unserviceable county materials, supplies and equipment. 
(2)  If materials, suppliers or equipment becomes unserviceable, either by becoming obsolete, being replaced, or becoming dysfunctional to the point where it is unfeasible to use such property, or for other reasons, the department head responsible for the property shall bring its unserviceability to the attention of the purchasing agent, who shall bring the matter to the attention of the board of commissioners at its next regular meeting. 
(3)  If the fair market value of the unserviceable property is less than twenty-five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per unit at the time of disposal, the purchasing agent shall sell or dispose of same in the way most beneficial to the county. Disposal may be by donation, by sale pursuant to bid, by auction, by trade-in, or in any other legal manner deemed feasible by the purchasing agent, but in every such event, the method of disposal is subject to the prior approval of the board of commissioners. 
(4)  If the board of commissioners deems fit, invitations to potential purchasers for sealed bids shall be made by the purchasing agent in such manner, in his/her discretion, as will enable free and open competition in the bidding. In the event calls for bids are advertised in a newspaper, such advertisement shall be run once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks, in the legal county paper before the bids are opened; unless the otherwise provided by law. 
(5)  In the disposal, donation or sale of unserviceable property, Lamar County persons or firms shall be given preference by the purchasing agent in generally the same fashion Lamar County vendors are favored in the purchase of materials, supplies and equipment. 
(6)  All funds from any sale of unserviceable property shall be documented in the purchasing agent's records and turned over to the county treasury upon receipt. A record of the disposal, donation, auction or sale of items of unserviceable property shall be kept in accordance with Georgia law. 
(j)  Information vendors; bidding list. 
(1)  Persons or firms who wish to be on the Lamar County vendors mailing list shall file a properly completed bidder's mailing list application, together with such other lists as may be attached to the application form. It is the purchasing agent's responsibility to provide such applications to interested persons and/or firms and to compile and periodically update a list of Lamar County vendors. 
(2)  When bids for materials, supplies or equipment are sought, the purchasing agent or his/her designee shall contact those persons or firms on the bidders mailing list who provide such materials, supplies or equipment, along with other potential vendors. 
(3)  It is not necessary to be on the bidders mailing list to be considered a Lamar County vendor entitled to such preferential treatment as is contained elsewhere in this ordinance. However, before any purchase is made from a Lamar County vendor on the basis of the preferential treatment specified elsewhere herein, the vendor must complete a bidders mailing list form and supply other pertinent information to the purchasing agent if requested. 
(4)  The purchasing agent, to the extent feasible, shall inform local and other vendors of Lamar County's purchasing policy and seek assistance from them in not accepting any requests for materials, supplies or equipment from any county employee without first having secured a properly authorized purchase order. The purchasing agent shall advise vendors to forward invoices to the board of commissioners and not to the department office. 
(5)  The purchasing agent shall tender copies of the Lamar County Purchasing Policy to all vendors on the bidders mailing list and to other vendors at the request.

ARTICLE VII. - CODE OF ETHICS 

Sec. 2-2-308. - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose of this code of ethics is to establish ethical standards of conduct for all officials and employees of Lamar County by identifying acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the community and the organization and by requiring disclosure by such officials and employees of private financial, or other interests, in matters affecting the county. 
Those covered officials and employees are bound to observe in their official acts the highest standards of behavior and to faithfully discharge the duties and responsibilities of their office, regardless of personal considerations, recognizing that the public interest must be their primary concern. 
Covered officials and employees shall not exceed their authority or breach the law, or ask others to do so, and they shall work in full cooperation with other public officials and employees unless prohibited from doing so by law or by officially recognized confidentiality of their work. 
(Ord. of 3-15-99, § I(1); Ord. of 10-2-01, § I(1))

The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in the Code of Ethics of Lamar County, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section: 
(1)  Code of ethics means the Code of Ethics of Lamar County. 
(2)  County means Lamar County, Georgia. 
(3)  Covered official means any member of the Board of Commissioners of Lamar County and any person who has been appointed to a position by the Board of Commissioners of Lamar County including, but not limited to, the county administrator, department heads, and any member of the planning commission, the board of appeals, or any other appointed board.

However, enforcement shall be through procedures established by the State Bar of Georgia.

(Ord. of 3-15-99, § I(2); Ord. of 10-2-01, § I(2)) 
Sec. 2-2-310. - Ethical considerations. 
Notwithstanding any provisions of law to the contrary, each covered official and employee of Lamar County shall: 
(1)  Uphold the Constitution, laws and regulations of the United States, the State of Georgia, and all governments herein and never be a party to their evasion; 
(2)  Never discriminate by the dispensing of special favors or privileges to anyone, whether or not for compensation; 
(3)  Not engage in any business with the government, or allow any member of his/her immediate family to engage in any business with the government, either directly or indirectly, which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of his/her governmental duties; 
(4)  Never use any information coming to him/her confidentially in the performance of governmental duties as a means for making private profit; 
(5)  Expose corruption wherever discovered; 
(6)  Never solicit, accept, or agree to accept gifts, loans, gratuities, discounts, favors, hospitality, or services from any person, association, or corporation for himself/herself, or any member of his/her immediate family, under circumstances from which it could reasonably be inferred that a major purpose of the donor is to influence the performance or failure to perform any of the official's/employees official duties. For gifts, loans, gratuities, discounts, favors, hospitality, or services solicited, accepted, or agreed to accept under circumstances from which it cannot be reasonably inferred that a major purpose of the donor was to influence the performance of the official's/employee's official duties, the following rules shall apply: A covered official shall publicly disclose, prior to discussing or taking any official action on any matter involving the donor, any gift or campaign contribution (cash or in kind) received by him/her, or any member of his/her immediate family, greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00). Receipt of gifts and campaign contributions valued at five hundred dollars ($500.00) or more by a covered official, or member of his/her immediate family, will prohibit the covered official from participating or taking official action on any matter involving the donor; 
(7)  Never accept any economic opportunity for himself/herself, or any member of his/her immediate family, under circumstance where he/she knows or should know that there is a substantial possibility that the opportunity is being afforded with intent to influence his/her conduct in the performance or failure to perform his/her official duties. All business relationships, regardless of the dollar amount involved, between a covered official, or a member of his/her immediate family, and anyone having business with the county shall be publicly disclosed prior to any discussion or official action being taken on the matter. Should the business relationship provide a covered official, or a member of his/her immediate family, with at least three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) on an annual basis, such covered official shall be prohibited from participating or taking official action on any matter involving the person with whom such business relationship exists; and 
(8)  Never engage in other conduct which is unbecoming to an official/employee or which constitutes a breach of public trust. 
(9)  Nothing in the above list is meant to limit or replace in any way other federal, state and county ethical requirements for covered officials and employees, including but not limited to the goals, requirements and proscriptions of the United States and Georgia Constitutions, the prohibitions set forth in Title 16 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, and regulations set forth in Lamar County Code section 1-2-7(b) as to oaths of office, and section 2-2-33 as to nepotism. Such other ethical requirements are considered to be a part of this division and failure to abide by same will subject violators to consequences set forth herein.

Any such public hearings shall allow basic due process rights to the accused, including but not limited to the right to counsel and to present evidence, and shall be conducted in accordance with the Georgia Administrative Procedure Act, O.C.G.A. § 50-13-13 et seq., or such other method agreed upon by the commissioners and reasonably calculated to provide a full and fair hearing to the accused. Covered officials and employees are subject to the following penalties and action for violations of this code of ethics: 
(1)  Written reprimand or public censure; 
(2)  Recovery of value transferred or received by the county; 
(3)  Cancellation of the contract or rejection of the bid or offer; 
(4)  A monetary fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00); and 
(5)  Demotion or termination. 
(c)  If a complaint is received by the administrator of the board of commissioners which alleges a violation of the code of ethics by a member of the board of commissioners, an independent review board will be formed if the complaint alleges sufficient facts which, if proven to be true, would be a violation of the code of ethics. The chief superior court judge of the judicial circuit in which Lamar County lies shall make the determination of whether or not a review board should be impaneled. If a review board is needed, three (3) county attorneys within reasonably close geographical proximity to the county and chosen by the chief judge will be requested to conduct a public hearing based upon the complaint. A majority vote, based on clear and convincing evidence, will determine the existence of violation.

ARTICLE VIII. - SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY[12] 

Footnotes: 
--- (12) --- 
Editor's note— Provisions in this policy are consistent with requirements specifically set forth in 49 CFR Part 655, [o]r Part 40, as amended; and the Drug-Free Workplace Act (49 CFR Part 29). Additional provisions are set forth under the authority of the McIntosh Trail Regional Transit System. 

Sec. 2-2-330. - Policy. 
Lamar County (separately and as a member of the McIntosh Trail Regional Transit System) is dedicated to providing safe, dependable, and economical transportation services to our transit system passengers. County employees are our most valuable resource and it is our goal to provide a healthy, satisfying working environment which promotes personal opportunities for growth. In meeting these goals, it is our policy to: 
(1)  Assure that employees are not impaired in their ability to perform assigned duties in a safe, productive, and healthy manner; 
(2)  Create a workplace environment free from the adverse effects of drug abuse and alcohol misuse; 
(3)  Prohibit the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of controlled substances; and 
(4)  Encourage employees to seek professional assistance any time personal problems, including alcohol or drug dependency, adversely affect their ability to perform their assigned duties. 
(Ord. of 2-19-02, § 1.0) 
Sec. 2-2-331. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this policy is to assure worker fitness for duty and to protect our employees, passengers, and the public from the risks posed by the misuse of alcohol and use of prohibited drugs. This policy is also intended to comply with all applicable federal regulations governing workplace antidrug and alcohol programs in the transit industry. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation has published 49 CFR Part 655, as amended, that mandates urine drug testing and breath alcohol testing for safety-sensitive positions and prohibits performance of safety-sensitive functions when there is a positive test result. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has also published 49 CFR Part 40, as amended, that sets standards for the collection and testing of urine and breath specimens. In addition, the federal government published 49 CFR Part 29, "The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988," which requires the establishment of drug-free workplace policies and the reporting of certain drug-related offenses to the FTA. This policy incorporates those requirements for safety-sensitive employees and others when so noted. 
(Ord. of 2-19-02, § 2.0) 
Sec. 2-2-332. - Applicability. 
This policy applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive transit system employees, paid part-time employees, contract employees, and contractors when they are on transit property or when performing any transit-related safety-sensitive or non-safety-sensitive business. This policy applies to off-site lunch periods or breaks when an employee is scheduled to return to work. Visitors, vendors, and contractor employees are governed by this policy while on transit premises and will not be permitted to conduct transit business if found to be in violation of this policy. 
A safety-sensitive function is any duty related to the safe operation of mass-transit service including the operation of a revenue-service vehicle (whether or not the vehicle is in revenue service), dispatch, maintenance of a revenue-service vehicle or equipment used in revenue service, security personnel who carry firearms, and any other employee who holds a commercial driver's license. Maintenance functions include the repair, overhaul, and rebuild of engines, vehicles and/or equipment. A list of safety-sensitive positions that perform one (1) or more of the above-mentioned duties is attached. 
(Ord. of 2-19-02, § 3.0) 
Sec. 2-2-333. - Prohibited substances. 
"Prohibited substances" addressed by this policy include the following: 
(1)  Illegally used controlled substances or drugs. The use of any illegal drug or any substance identified in schedules I through V of section 202 of the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. 812), as further defined by 21 CFR 1300.11 through 1300.15 is prohibited at all times unless a legal prescription has been written for the substance. This includes, but is not limited to: marijuana, amphetamines, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and cocaine, as well as any drug not approved for medical use by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Illegal use includes use of any illegal drug, misuse of legally prescribed drugs, and use of illegally obtained prescription drugs. Safety-sensitive employees will be tested for marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, and phencyclidine as described in section 2-2-335 of this article. 
(2)  Legal drugs. The appropriate use of legally prescribed drugs and nonprescription medications is not prohibited. However, the use of any substance which carries a warning label that indicates that mental functioning, motor skills, or judgment may be adversely affected must be reported to a transit system supervisor. In addition, the employee must obtain a written release from the attending physician releasing the person to perform their job duties any time they obtain a performance-altering prescription. 
A legally prescribed drug means that individual has a prescription or other written approval from a physician for the use of a drug in the course of medical treatment. It must include the patient's name, the name of the substance, quantity/amount to be taken, and the period of authorization. The misuse or abuse of legal drugs while performing transit business is prohibited. Also the use of medical marijuana and hemp products which present levels of drugs or drug metabolites above the DOT minimum thresholds is considered a violation of this policy. 
(3)  Alcohol. The use of beverages containing alcohol or substances including any medication, mouthwash, food, candy, or any other substance such that alcohol is present in the body while performing transit business is prohibited. The concentration of alcohol is expressed in terms of alcohol per 210 liters of breath as measured by an evidential breath-testing device. 
(Ord. of 2-19-02, § 4.0) 
Sec. 2-2-334. - Prohibited conduct. 
(1)  Manufacture, trafficking, possession, and use. Transit system employees are prohibited from engaging in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of prohibited substances on transit authority premises, in transit vehicles, in uniform or while on transit authority business. Employees who violate this provision will be discharged. Law enforcement shall be notified, as appropriate, where criminal activity is suspected. 
(2)  Intoxication/under the influence. Any safety-sensitive or non-safety-sensitive employee who is reasonably suspected of being intoxicated, impaired, under the influence of a prohibited substances, or not fit for duty shall be suspended from job duties pending an investigation and verification of condition. Employees found to be under the influence of a prohibited substance or who fail to pass a drug or alcohol test shall be removed from duty and subject to disciplinary action. A drug or alcohol test is considered positive if the individual is found to have a quantifiable presence of a prohibited substance in the body above the minimum thresholds defined in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. 
(3)  Alcohol and drug use. No safety-sensitive or non-safety-sensitive employee should report for duty or remain on duty when his/her ability to perform assigned safety-sensitive functions is adversely affected by alcohol or when his/her breath alcohol concentration is four one-hundredths (0.04) or greater. No safety-sensitive or non-safety-sensitive employee shall use alcohol while on duty, in uniform, while performing safety-sensitive functions, or just before or just after performing a safety-sensitive function. No safety-sensitive or non-safety-sensitive employee shall use alcohol within four (4) hours of reporting for duty, or during the hours that they are on call. 
All safety-sensitive employees are prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty any time there is a quantifiable presence of a prohibited substance in the body above the minimum thresholds defined in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. Violation of these provisions is prohibited and punishable by disciplinary action up to and including termination. 
(4)  Compliance with testing requirements. All safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive employees will be subject to urine drug testing and breath alcohol testing as a condition of employment. Any safety-sensitive or non-safety-sensitive employee who refuses to comply with a request for testing shall be removed from duty and their employment terminated. Any safety-sensitive or non-safety-sensitive employee who is suspected of providing false information in connection with a test, or who is suspected of falsifying test results through tampering, contamination, adulteration, or substitution will be required to undergo an observed collection. Verification of falsifying test results will result in the employee's removal from duty and their employment terminated. 
The following items will be considered as a test refusal: 
□ Employee fails to appear for any test within a reasonable time after being directed to do so (the amount of time it takes to travel from the worksite to the testing site). 
□ Fails to remain at the testing site until the process is complete. 
□ Fails to provide a urine specimen for any drug test required by Part 40 or DOT regulations. 
□ Fails to provide a sufficient amount of urine when directed, and it has been determined, through a required medical evaluation, that there was no adequate medical explanation for the failure. 
□ Fails to undergo a medical examination or evaluation, as directed by the MOR as part of the verification process, or as directed by the DER as part of the "shy bladder" procedures. 
□ Fails to cooperate with any part of the testing process (e.g., refuses to follow instructions from medical staff or behaves in a confrontational way that disrupts the collection process). 
□ If the MRO reports that there is a verified adulterated or substituted test result. 
□ In the case of a directly observed or monitored collection in a drug test, fails to permit the observation or monitoring of your provision of a specimen. 
Drug tests can be performed any time a safety-sensitive employee is on duty. An alcohol test can be performed when the safety-sensitive employee is actually performing a safety-sensitive duty, just before, or just after the performance of a safety-sensitive duty. 
(5)  Treatment requirements. All employees are encouraged to make use of the available resources for treatment for alcohol misuse and illegal drug use problems. Under certain circumstances, employees may be required to undergo treatment for substance abuse or alcohol misuse. Any employee who refuses or fails to comply with transit system requirements for treatment, after care, or return to duty shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. The cost of any treatment or rehabilitation services will be paid for directly by the employee or their insurance provider. Employees will be allowed to take accumulated sick leave and vacation leave to participate in the prescribed rehabilitation program. 
(6)  Notifying the transit system of criminal drug conviction. All employees are required to notify the transit system of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace within five (5) days after such conviction. Failure to comply with this provision shall result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 
(7)  Proper application of the policy. The transit system is dedicated to assuring fair and equitable application of this substance abuse policy. Therefore, supervisors/managers are required to use and apply all aspects of this policy in an unbiased and impartial manner. Any supervisor/manager who knowingly disregards the requirements of this policy, or who is found to deliberately misuse the policy in regard to subordinates, shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. 
(Ord. of 2-19-02, § 5.0) 
Sec. 2-2-335. - Testing procedures. 
Analytical urine drug testing and breath testing for alcohol may be conducted when circumstance warrant or as required by federal regulations. All safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive employees shall be subject to testing prior to employment, for reasonable suspicion, and following an accident as defined in subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this policy. In addition, all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive employees will be tested prior to returning to duty after failing a drug or alcohol test and after completion of the substance abuse professional's recommended treatment program and subsequent release to duty. Follow-up testing will also be conducted following return to duty for a period of one (1) to five (5) years, with at least six (6) tests performed during the first year. 
Those employees who perform safety-sensitive functions as defined in the attachment to this policy shall also be subject to testing on a random, unannounced basis. 
Testing shall be conducted in a manner to assure a high degree of accuracy and reliability and using techniques, equipment, and laboratory facilities which have been approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS). All testing will be conducted consistent with the procedures put forth in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. The procedures will be performed in a private, confidential manner and every effort will be made to protect the employee, the integrity of the drug testing procedure, and the validity of the test result. 
The drugs that will be tested for include marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine. Urine specimens will be collected using the split specimen collection method described in 49 CFR Part 40. Each specimen will be accompanied by a DOT chain of custody and control form and identified using a unique identification number that attributes the specimen to the correct individual. An initial drug screen will be conducted on the primary urine specimen. For those specimens that are not negative, a confirmatory gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) test will be performed. The test will be considered positive if the amounts present are above the minimum thresholds established in 49 CFR Part 40, as amended. Attachment 3 lists the minimum thresholds established for each drug and/or its metabolites. The test results from the laboratory will be reported to a medical review officer. A medical review officer (MRO) is a licensed physician with detailed knowledge of substance abuse disorders and drug testing. The MRO will review the test results to ensure the scientific validity of the test and to determine whether there is a legitimate medical explanation for a confirmed positive test result. The MRO will contact the employee, notify the employee of the positive laboratory result, and provide the employee with an opportunity to explain the confirmed test result. The MRO will subsequently review the employee's medical history/medical records to determine whether there is a legitimate medical explanation for a positive laboratory result. If no legitimate medical explanation is found, the test will be verified positive and reported to the company program manager. If a legitimate explanation is found, the MRO will report the test result as negative. The split specimen will be stored at the initial laboratory until the analysis of the primary specimen is completed. If the primary specimen is negative, the split will be discarded. If the primary is positive, the split will be retained for testing if so requested by the employee through the medical review officer. 
Observed collections. Consistent with 49 CFR part 40 collection under direct observation (by a person of the same gender) with no advance notice will occur if: 
1.  The laboratory reports to the MRO that a specimen is invalid, and the MRO reports to Lamar County that there was not an adequate medical explanation for the result; or 
2.  The MRO reports to Lamar County that the original positive, adulterated, or substituted test result had to be cancelled because the test of the split specimen could not be performed. 
a.  Lamar County may direct a collection under direct observation of an employee if the drug test is a return-to-duty rest or a follow-up test. 
b.  The collector, must immediately conduct a collection under direct observation if: 
i.  They are directed by Lamar County to do so; or 
ii.  The collector observes materials brought to the collection site or the employee's conduct clearly indicates an attempt to tamper with a specimen; or 
iii.  The temperature on the original specimen was out of range; [or] 
iv.  The original specimen appeared to have been tampered with. 
In instances where there is a reason to believe an employee is abusing a substance other than the five (5) drugs listed above, the transit system reserves the right to test for additional drugs under the transit system's own authority using standard laboratory testing protocols. 
Tests for breath alcohol concentration will be conducted utilizing a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration-approved testing device operated by a trained technician. If the initial test indicates an alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths (0.02) or greater, a second test will be performed to confirm the results of the initial test. The confirmatory test will be performed using an NHTSA-approved evidential breath testing device (EBT) operated by a trained breath alcohol technician (BAT). The EBT will identify each test by a unique sequential identification number. This number, time, and unit identifier will be provided on each EBT printout. The EBT printout along with an approved alcohol testing form will be used to document the test, the subsequent results, and to attribute the test to the correct employee. The test will be performed in a private, confidential manner as required by 49 CFR, Part 40, as amended. The procedure will be followed as prescribed to protect the employee and to maintain the integrity of the alcohol testing procedures and validity of the test result. 
A safety-sensitive or non-safety-sensitive employee who has a confirmed alcohol concentration of greater than two one-hundredths (0.02) but less than 0.04 (four one-hundredths) will be removed from his/her position for eight (8) hours unless a retest results in a concentration measure of less than two one-hundredths (0.02). The inability to perform safety-sensitive duties due to an alcohol test result of greater than two one-hundredths (0.02) but less than four one-hundredths (0.04) will be considered an unexcused missout subject to transit system disciplinary procedures. An alcohol concentration of four one-hundredths (0.04) or greater will be considered a positive alcohol test and in violation of this policy and a violation of the requirements set forth in 49 CFR, Part 654, for safety-sensitive employees. 
Any safety-sensitive or non-safety-sensitive employee that has a confirmed positive drug or alcohol test will be removed from his/her position, informed of educational and rehabilitation programs available, and referred to a substance abuse professional (SAP) for assessment. A positive drug and/or alcohol test will also result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. 
The transit system affirms the need to protect individual dignity, privacy, and confidentiality throughout the testing process. In addition, if at any time the integrity of the testing procedures or the validity of the test results is compromised, the test will be cancelled. 
(a)  Employee requested testing. Any safety-sensitive or non-safety-sensitive employee who questions the results of a required drug test under subsections (2) through (7) of this policy may request that the split sample be tested. This test must be conducted at a different DHHS-certified laboratory. The test must be conducted on the split sample that was provided by the employee at the same time as the original sample. All costs for such testing are paid by the employee unless the result of the split sample test invalidates the result of the original test or the employee cannot afford to pay the cost. The method of collecting, storing, and testing the split sample will be consistent with the procedures set forth in 49 CFR, Part 40, as amended. The employee's request for a split sample test must be made to the medical review officer within seventy-two (72) hours of notice of the original sample verified test result. Requests after seventy-two (72) hours will only be accepted if the delay was due to documentable facts that were beyond the control of the employee. 
(b)  Pre-employment testing. All safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive position applicants shall undergo urine drug testing prior to hire or transfer into a safety-sensitive position. Receipt by the transit system of a negative drug test result is required prior to employment. Failure of a pre-employment drug test will disqualify an applicant for employment for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days. Evidence of the absence of drug dependency from a substance abuse professional that meets with the approval of the company and a negative pre-employment drug test will be required prior to further consideration for employment. The cost for the assessment and any subsequent treatment will be the sole responsibility of the individual. A pre-employment/pre-transfer test will also be performed anytime an employee's status changes from an inactive status in a safety-sensitive position to an active status in a safety-sensitive position (i.e., return from worker's comp, return from leave of absence). 
In addition, FTA requires all safety-sensitive employees who have been off duty for ninety (90) or more days for any reason are required to successfully pass a pre-employment drug test prior to the performance of an active status in a safety-sensitive position (i.e. Return from worker's comp, return from leave of absence). 
(c)  Reasonable suspicion testing. All safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive employees may be subject to a fitness for duty evaluation, and urine and/or breath testing when there are reasons to believe that drug or alcohol use is adversely affecting job performance. A reasonable suspicion referral for testing will be made on the basis of documented objective facts and circumstances which are consistent with the short-term effects of substance abuse or alcohol misuse. Examples of reasonable suspicion include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1.  Physical signs and symptoms consistent with prohibited substance use or alcohol misuse. 
2.  Evidence of the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of controlled substances, drugs, alcohol, or other prohibited substance. 
3.  Occurrence of a serious or "potentially" serious accident that may have been caused by prohibited substance abuse or alcohol misuse. 
4.  Fights (to mean physical contact), assaults, and flagrant disregard or violations of established safety, security, or other operating procedures. 
Reasonable suspicion referrals must be made by a supervisor who is trained to detect the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol use and who reasonably concludes that an employee may be adversely affected or impaired in his/her work performance due to possible prohibited substance abuse or alcohol misuse. 
(d)  Post-accident testing. All safety-sensitive employees will be required to undergo urine and breath testing if they are involved in an accident with a Lamar County vehicle (regardless of whether or not the vehicle is in revenue service) that results in a fatality. This includes all surviving safety-sensitive employees that are operating the vehicle and any other whose performance could have contributed to the accident. In addition, a post-accident test will be conducted if an accident results in injuries requiring immediate transportation to a medical treatment facility or one (1) or more vehicles incurs disabling damage unless the employee can be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident. The accident definition may include some incidents where an individual is injured even though there is no vehicle collision. 
Following an accident, the safety-sensitive employees will be tested as soon as possible, but not to exceed eight (8) hours for alcohol testing and thirty-two (32) hours for drug testing. Any safety-sensitive employee involved in an accident must refrain from alcohol use for eight (8) hours following the accident or until he/she undergoes a post-accident alcohol test. Any safety-sensitive employee who leaves the scene of the accident without justifiable explanation prior to submission to drug and alcohol testing will be considered to have refused the test and their employment terminated. Employees tested under this provision will include not only the operations personnel, but any other covered employee whose performance could have contributed to the accident. 
If the transit system is unable to perform a FTA drug and alcohol test (e.g., employee is unconscious, employee is detained by law enforcement agency), the transit system may use drug and alcohol post-accident test results administered by state and local law enforcement officials. The state and local law enforcement officials must have independent authority for the test and the employer must obtain the results in conformance with state and local law. 
(e)  Random testing. Employees in safety-sensitive positions will be subjected to random, unannounced testing. The selection of safety-sensitive employees for random testing will be made using a scientifically valid method that ensures each covered employee that they will have an equal chance of being selected each time selections are made. The random tests will be unannounced and spread throughout the year. Tests can be conducted at any time during an employee's shift (i.e. beginning, middle, end). Employees are required to proceed immediately to the collection site upon notification of their random selection. 
(f)  Return-to-duty testing. All safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive employees who previously tested positive on a drug or alcohol test must test negative (below two one-hundredths (0.02) for alcohol) on a return-to-duty test and be evaluated and released to duty by a substance abuse professional before returning to work. A substance abuse professional (SAP) is a licensed physician or certified psychologist, social worker, employee assistance professional, or addition counselor certified by the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors Certification Commission or by the International Certification Reciprocity Consortium/Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse. The SAP must also have clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of drug and alcohol related diseases. Before scheduling the return to duty test, the SAP must assess the employee and determine if the required treatment has been completed. 
(g)  Follow-up testing. Safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive employees will be required to undergo frequent, unannounced urine and/or breath testing following their return to duty. The follow-up testing will be performed for a period of one (1) to five (5) years with a minimum of six (6) tests to be performed the first year. The frequency and duration of the follow-up tests beyond the minimum, will be determined by a qualified substance abuse professional. 
(Ord. of 2-19-02, § 6.0) 
Sec. 2-2-336. - Employment assessment. 
Any safety-sensitive or non-safety-sensitive employee who tests positive for the presence of illegal drugs or alcohol above the minimum thresholds set forth in 49 CFR, Part 40, as amended, will be referred for evaluation by a substance abuse professional (SAP). A SAP is a licensed or certified physician, psychologist, social worker, employee assistance professional, or addiction counselor with knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol and drug-related disorders. The SAP will evaluate each employee to determine what assistance, if any, the employee needs in resolving problems associated with prohibited drug use or alcohol misuse. 
Assessment by a SAP or participation in the company's employee assistance program does not shield an employee from disciplinary action or guarantee employment or reinstatement with the transit system. The Lamar County Disciplinary Code should be consulted to determine the penalty for performance-based infractions and violation of policy provisions. 
If a safety-sensitive or non-safety-sensitive employee is allowed to return to duty, he/she must properly follow the rehabilitation program prescribed by the SAP, the employee must have negative return-to-duty drug and alcohol tests, and be subject to unannounced follow-up testing for a period of one (1) to five (5) years. The cost of any treatment or rehabilitation services will be paid directly by the employee or their insurance provider. 
Employees will be allowed to take accumulated sick leave and vacation leave to participate in the prescribed rehabilitation program. 
(Ord. of 2-19-02, § 7.0) 
Sec. 2-2-337. - Information disclosure. 
To be considered for employment, all applicants will be asked to give consent to (McIntosh Trail Transit System) for a background check of the applicant's previous DOT-covered employer over the past two (2) years. The information requested will include: 
1.  Alcohol test results of four one-hundredths (0.04) or higher alcohol concentration. 
2.  Verified positive drug tests. 
3.  Refusals to be tested (including verified adulterated or substituted drug test results.) 
4.  Other violations of DOT agency drug and alcohol testing regulations. 
5.  With respect to any employee who violated a DOT drug and alcohol regulation, documentation of the employee's successful completion of DOT return-to-duty requirements (including follow-up tests). 
All drug and alcohol testing records will be maintained in a secure manner so that disclosure of information to unauthorized persons does not occur. Information will only be released in the following circumstances: 
1.  To a third party only as directed by specific, written instruction of the employee; 
2.  To the decision-maker in a lawsuit, grievance, or other proceeding initiated by or on the behalf of the employee tested; 
3.  To a subsequent employer upon receipt of a written request from the employee; 
4.  To the National Transportation Safety Board during an accident investigation; 
5.  To the DOT or any DOT agency with regulatory authority over the employer or any of its employees, or to a state oversight agency authorized to oversee rail fixed-guideway systems; or 
6.  To the employee, upon written request. 
7.  Records will be released if requested by federal, state, or local safety agency with regulatory authority over Lamar County or the employee. 
8.  If a party seeks a court order to release a specimen or part of a specimen contrary to any provision of Part 40, necessary legal steps to contest the issuance of the order will be taken. 
(Ord. of 2-19-02, § 8.0) 
Sec. 2-2-338. - Employee and supervisor training. 
All safety-sensitive employees will undergo a minimum of sixty (60) minutes of training on the signs and symptoms of drug use including the effects and consequences of drug use on personal health, safety, and the work environment. The training must also include manifestations and behavioral cues that may indicate prohibited drug use. 
Supervisors will also receive sixty (60) minutes of reasonable suspicion training on the physical, behavioral, and performance indicators of probable drug use and sixty (60) minutes of additional reasonable suspicion training on the physical, behavioral, speech, and performance indicators of probable alcohol misuse. 
Information on the signs, symptoms, health affects and consequences of alcohol misuse is presented in attachment 2 of this policy. 
(Ord. of 2-19-02, § 9.0) 
Sec. 2-2-339. - Re-entry contracts. 
Employees who re-enter the workforce must agree to a re-entry contract. That contract may include (but is not limited to): 
1.  A release-to-work-statement form [from] the substance abuse professional. 
2.  A negative test for drugs and/or alcohol. 
3.  An agreement to unannounced frequent follow-up testing for a period of one (1) to five (5) years with at least six (6) tests performed the first year. 
4.  A statement of work-related behaviors. 
5.  An agreement to follow specified after-care requirements with the understanding that violation of the re-entry contract is grounds for termination. 
(Ord. of 2-19-02, § 10.0)

Attachment 2  Alcohol Fact Sheet 
Alcohol is a socially acceptable drug that has been consumed throughout the world for centuries. It is considered a recreational beverage when consumed in moderation for enjoyment and relaxation during social gatherings. However, when consumed primarily for its physical and mood-altering effects, it is a substance of abuse. As a depressant, it slows down physical responses and progressively impairs mental functions. 
Signs and symptoms of use. 
• Dulled mental processes 
• Lack of coordination 
• Odor of alcohol on breath 
• Possible constricted pupils 
• Sleepy or stuporous condition 
• Slowed reaction rate

ARTICLE II. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 2-3.5-21. - Findings; public purpose. 
Based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; Dekalb County, Georgia; and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Florida, which experiences we believe are relevant to the problems faced by Lamar County, Georgia, we take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of the commission that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment", begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for an allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Therefore, the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow and/or encourage nudity. To that end, this ordinance is hereby adopted.

Thirty (30) days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
(i)  The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-7 et seq. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
(j)  The county may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.

Sec. 2-7-34. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of section 2-7-34(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES (National Pollution Discharge Elimination System) general permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in section 2-7-34(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a Local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 2-7-34(b)(2) of this article; 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: That under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph, the following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: Provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(d)  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 2-7-34(b) and (c) of this article. 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 2018-03, 10-16-18) 
Sec. 2-7-35. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal of the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Lamar County without first obtaining a permit from the Lamar County Zoning Office to perform such activity, and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD, if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the Lamar County Zoning Office and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this article. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 2-7-34(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three (3) copies of the applicant's soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-10. 
(3)  A fee, in the amount of one dollar ($1.00) shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
(4)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 2-7-34(c)(15) and (16) have been obtained, all fees have been paid and bonding, if required as per section 2-7-35(b)(7), has been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(6)  If a permit applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three (3) years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(7)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 2-7-34(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
(d)  Permits. 
(1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable, but in any event, not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary, and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 2-7-34(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 2-7-35 (b)(7) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
(Ord. No. 2018-03, 10-16-18) 
Sec. 2-7-36. - Inspection and enforcement. 
(a)  The Lamar County Zoning Office will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary, and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
(b)  The Lamar County Zoning Office shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
(c)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
(d)  The districts or the commission or both shall periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities that have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The districts or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
(e)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities that have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have ninety (90) days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within ninety (90) days after notification by the division, the division may revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority. 
(Ord. No. 2018-03, 10-16-18) 
Sec. 2-7-37. - Penalties and incentives. 
(a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
(b)  Stop-work orders. 
(1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five (5) days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five (5) days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
(2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; 
(3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; and 
(4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
(c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one (1) under the provisions of section 2-7-35(b)(7). The issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
(d)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the Director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for each violation.

(Ord. No. 2018-03, 10-16-18) 
Chapter 2-8 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 

Sec. 2-8-1. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of Georgia has in Georgia Code Annotated, Article IX, Section II, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of Lamar County, Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
(b)  Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of Lamar County, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; and 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(d)  Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
(7)  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. of 9-2-97, Art. 1) 
Sec. 2-8-2. - General provisions. 
(a)  Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of Lamar County, Georgia. 
(b)  Basis for area of special flood hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its flood insurance study (FIS), dated September 25, 2009, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revisions thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this chapter. For those land areas acquired by a municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS dated September 25, 2009, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, for Lamar County are hereby adopted by reference. 
Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS. 
The repository for public inspection of the flood insurance Study (FIS), accompanying maps and other supporting data is located in the Lamar County Building and Zoning Department (zoning office). 
(c)  Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities. 
(d)  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. 
(e)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing ordinance, easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(f)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(g)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of Lamar County or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(h)—(l).  Reserved. 
(m)  Penalties for violation. Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Lamar County Board of Commissioners from taking such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(Ord. of 9-2-97, Art. 2; Ord. No. 2009-05, 9-9-09) 
Sec. 2-8-3. - Administration. 
(a)  Designation of chapter administrator. The zoning administrator or his/her designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  Permit procedures. Application for a development permit shall be made to the zoning administrator on forms furnished by Lamar County, prior to any development activities, and may include, but not limited to the following: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the elevations of the area in question and the nature, location, dimensions, of existing or proposed structures, earthen fill placement, storage of materials or equipment, and drainage facilities. 
Specifically, the following information is required: 
(1)  Application stage: 
a.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level (or highest adjacent grade) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all proposed structures; 
b.  Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure will be floodproofed; 
c.  Design certification from a registered professional engineer or architect that any proposed nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the floodproofing criteria of section 2-8-4(b)(2); 
d.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of a proposed development; and

(6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
(8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
(9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
(b)  Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one (1) foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 2-8-4(a)(4), Elevated buildings. 
a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one (1) foot above the base flood elevation.

3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (b)(3)a. and c. above. 
(4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 2-8-2(b) are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
b.  Only if subsection (b)(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section. 
(c)  Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 2-8-2(b) where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 2-8-2(b), then the zoning administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this section. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall apply. 
(2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty (20) feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (a)(4), Elevated buildings. The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
(d)  Standards for areas of special flood hazard (zones AE) with established base flood elevations without designated floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 2-8-2(b), where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated, (zones AE) the following provisions apply: 
(1)  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
(2)  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or flood-proofed to elevations established in accordance with subsection 2-8-4(b). 
(e)  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). Areas of special flood hazard established in section 2-8-2(b) may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three (3) feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 2-8-4(a)(4), Elevated buildings. 
The administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level plus one (1) foot, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in section 2-8-3(b)(1)c. and (b)(2).

(4)  For subdivisions and/or developments greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-built" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR. 
(g)  Standards for critical facilities. 
(1)  Critical facilities shall not be located in the one-percent annual chance (100-year) floodplain or the 0.2 percent annual chance (500-year) floodplain. 
(2)  All ingress and egress from any critical facility must be protected to the 0.2 percent annual chance flood elevation. 
(Ord. of 9-2-97, Art. 4; Ord. No. 2009-05, 9-9-09) 
Sec. 2-8-5. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The board of appeals as established by the Lamar County Board of Commissioners shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of appeals may appeal such decision to the superior court, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
(h)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally aboveground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvements of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: "The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring." This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the health department or code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

ARTICLE IV. - MEDIA PRODUCTION PLANNING AND PERMITTING 

Sec. 2-12-70. - Purpose. 
It is the public policy of the State of Georgia to market the state as a location for media productions, recognizing the economic impact this industry provides, as well as the tourism it generates for local jurisdictions such as the Lamar County. Lamar County is further fortunate to have a diverse number of unique locations to attract movies and television productions to the county. Despite the many positive benefits a media production may offer, certain inconveniences may result if the production company and the county cannot work in concert to assure minimum standards are met and to assure a thoroughly planned production schedule is followed. These concerns are best addressed through a regulatory permit. 
(Ord. No. 2017-05, § 1, 10-17-17) 
Sec. 2-12-71. - Scope of coverage. 
The permit required under this chapter shall be a requirement for all movies, television or video series, pilots, feature films and documentaries, commercials, music videos, photo shoots, infomercials and public service announcements, whether the final product is intended for commercial use or not, unless the activity shall wholly occur on private property within an otherwise licensed facility (such as a film or television studio). Any media production on public property, intended to be closed to participation by the public, or restricting access to public property or facilities normally accessible by the public, shall require a permit. For purposes of this chapter, media production activity shall include areas designated for parking of trucks and equipment on public or private property, base camps used during the production activity, and food service areas. No public highway, street or road shall have its public access restricted or limited except by a permit issued pursuant to this chapter.

Nothing in this subsection waives the county's right to deny the application due to its insufficiency. 
(b)  Should the applicant fail to obtain any of the required documentation enumerated in section 2-17-72 above, the applicant and/or owner in the case of an agent applicant, shall make all reasonable efforts to obtain the required documentation from the designated authority. 
(c)  Any action by the zoning administrator to approve or deny an application for a solid waste handling facility or recovered materials processing facility permit shall be taken within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days of receipt of a completed application. Any solid waste handling facility permit application for which no action has been taken after one hundred eighty (180) calendar days or more shall be deemed to be approved. 
(d)  The zoning administrator may deny an application that does not comply with any of the provisions of this article, incomplete applications, and applications containing any false material statements by giving written notice to applicant and property owner. Should it be determined that a permit was issued pursuant to an incomplete application or an application containing a false material statement, or that a permit has been erroneously issued in violation of this article, the zoning administrator is authorized to immediately revoke the permit. 
(e)  Should the zoning administrator deny or revoke a permit, the reasons for the denial shall be stated in writing and mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address on the permit application, postmarked on or before the one hundred eightieth (180 th ) calendar day after the zoning administrator's receipt of the complete application, or by hand delivery to the applicant at time of denial.

DIVISION 2. - WATER SERVICE 

Sec. 2-19-25. - Water service where no extension is required. 
(a)  Application. Any consumer or developer desiring to be provided water services by the authority to property owned by that consumer or developer shall make an application for water services in person at the offices of the authority or at such other place as the authority may designate from time to time. The owner (whether consumer or developer) of the property to be served shall be responsible for filling out and providing the authority with a completed application. 
(b)  Water services to consumer with no extension. If the water distribution system: 
(1)  Is adjacent to a consumer's property and no water line extension is required, service will be provided upon the consumer executing the water subscription contract and payment of the connection fees. 
(2)  Is across the road from a consumer's property, service will be provided upon the consumer executing the water subscription contract, receipt of payment from the consumer for the boring, easing and pipe to cross the road, and receipt of payment from the consumer of the connection fees. 
(c)  Water services to developer with no extension. 
(1)  If the water distribution system is adjacent to a developer's property (as described in the vesting deed before subdivision), service will be provided to the nearest property line of the developer's property (as described in the vesting deed before subdivision) so long as the property (as planned for development) has been properly deeded, zoned, subdivided into a platted subdivision and recorded of record as a subdivision (whether commercial, industrial, or residential) according to the laws of the State of Georgia and the ordinances of Lamar County; and so long as the developer has executed a water subscription contract and has paid the applicable connection fees. 
If the water distribution system is directly across the road from a developer's property, service will be provided according to the provisions above, with the addition of the developer paying for the boring, casing and pipe to cross the road. 
(2)  A developer shall, at his, her or its sole cost, extend water lines into each subdivision so that the line will serve each lot developed therein. 
(3)  Any property owner (not otherwise meeting the definition of developer) who purchases a subdivided plot of property from a developer that has extended water lines into a subdivision shall be considered a consumer for the purposes of this section. 
(d)  Waiting list. Once a consumer or developer complies with the above-stated terms, that customer will be placed upon the authority's meter installation waiting list. Thereafter, the authority will install a meter and commence service as soon as is practicable. 
(Ord. of 2-5-02, Art. III) 
Sec. 2-19-26. - Water line extensions. 
(a)  Generally. Initially, when public funds are available and a need for expansion arises, in the sole discretion of the authority, the authority will extend water lines throughout the county in the order established by a priority road list adopted by the authority. The priority road list shall be based upon a balance of sound engineering and the goal of expansion of service to most possible consumers and developers. A current road priority list shall be maintained by the authority and made available to the public for inspection. Said priority list may be changed, from time to time without notice, at the sole discretion of the authority. 
During the initial extension of water lines throughout the county and thereafter, extension of water lines at the request of a consumer or developer shall be governed by the provisions of this section. 
(b)  Water service to residential consumers requiring line extensions. 
(1)  Generally. Water lines may be extended along county roads which have a minimum dedicated right-of-way of sixty (60) feet, or along presently existing county roads where easements acceptable to the authority for the installation and maintenance of the water line have been obtained at no expense to the authority. 
(2)  Application. Any residential consumer wishing to have water lines extended to their property shall make an application for water services in person at the offices of the authority or at such other place as the authority may designate from time to time. 
(3)  Application fee. Prior to the commencement of construction, the residential consumer to whose property water lines are to be extended shall pay a sum estimated by the authority per linear foot of water line (of sufficient capacity to service the residential consumer) installed from the authority's existing line to a point perpendicular to the residential consumer's residence (or, in the case of planned but not yet constructed residences, to a point perpendicular to where the residence is planned to be constructed). The estimated sum shall be sufficient to cover all costs associated with design, materials, and construction involved in the extension. Installations over rock and wetlands are impossible to estimate and will be charged at cost. 
i.  In its sole discretion, the authority may establish a program by which the residential consumer may finance the cost of the extension over a set period of time. In such instances, the residential consumer would make regular payments as part of the monthly water billing. 
ii.  In the event that it becomes apparent to the authority that the cost of extension of water lines to a residential consumer exceeds the charged estimate, the authority may immediately terminate work on the extension until such time as the residential consumer pays (or agrees to pay under subsection i. of this section) such additional funds as are necessary. 
iii.  In the event that it becomes impossible, in the authority's sole discretion, to install water lines to a residential consumer, the authority shall refund the application fee provided for in this section. 
(4)  Additional obligations. In addition to all other obligations placed upon a residential consumer by this chapter or other applicable law, prior to the authority approving any residential consumer's application for the extension of water lines and water services, the residential consumer shall: 
a.  Obtain such right-of-way deeds and/or easements as are required by the county and/or the authority; 
b.  Execute the line extension petition provided by the authority; 
c.  Pay the water line extension fees described in subsection (b)(3); 
d.  Pay the applicable connection fee; 
e.  Execute a water subscription contract. 
(5)  Approval by authority. Once the application has been completed, it will be submitted to the authority for approval. If the application is approved by the authority, an estimated date of completion will be given to the residential consumer; however, a date of completion cannot be guaranteed due to changes in work schedule, weather conditions, equipment breakdown, delays in delivery of materials, improvement of right-of-way or other unpredictable circumstances. 
(c)  Water services to residential developers requiring line extensions. 
(1)  Generally. If a water line extension is to serve a developer's residential subdivision development, the developer shall, in addition to obligations set forth in subsection (b) above (regarding residential consumers requiring line extensions), submit to the authority the following: 
a.  An application for line extension; 
b.  Three (3) copies of a plat or accurate drawing of the property to be served. The plat or drawing shall contain the following information:

ii.  Location of the existing roads and proposed roads to serve the property; 
iii.  An exact footage measurement of water line required to be installed in order to serve the property; 
iv.  Location of all water lines and appurtenances to be constructed in the area to be developed; 
v.  Estimated daily consumption. 
d.  The required water line extension fee. 
(2)  Additional lines. if units served will require fire lines and/or sprinkler systems to the structure, expenses for same shall be borne by the developer.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Secs. 2-25-1—2-25-18. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - LITTLE TOWALIGA RIVER WATERSHED 

Sec. 2-25-19. - Introduction; purpose. 
The Eady Creek Reservoir is located in Lamar County, Georgia, and is owned by the City of Barnesville. The Little Towaliga River watershed is upstream of a supplemental withdrawal at the "Low-Head" Dam on the Little Towaliga River. This withdrawal discharges to the Eady Creek Reservoir. The Eady Creek Watershed upstream of the Eady Creek Reservoir is contained within the Little Towaliga River Watershed. The reservoir is a water supply reservoir for the City of Barnesville, Aldora, Milner and unincorporated portions of Lamar County. The purpose of this watershed protection plan is to establish criteria pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8 for the protection of drinking water watersheds. This protection is necessary for the enhancement of public health, safety and welfare as well as to assure that surface sources of drinking water are of high quality in order to be treated to meet all state and federal drinking water standards. The criteria set forth accomplish this by establishing buffer zones around streams and by specifying allowable impervious surface densities within the Little Towaliga River watershed upstream of the low head dam intake. 
Secondary objectives are to: 
(a)  Manage the reservoir and the Little Towaliga River watershed in a manner that will conserve the basic resources of air, soil, and water; 
(b)  Provide for diverse and viable plant, animal, and fish communities; 
(c)  Give special consideration for the protection of threatened and endangered plant and animal species; 
(d)  Manage the reservoir to properly establish, enhance, and maintain acceptable fish and wildlife habitat, aesthetic quality, and sustain natural environmental conditions; 
(e)  Manage use of the reservoir in a manner that provides the least environmental impact; 
(f)  Provide for the protection of public land and water.

(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
ARTICLE 4. - GENERAL PROCEDURES 

Sec. 401. - Initial information. 
(a)  Article 4 outlines the procedures to be followed in order to comply with the requirements of these regulations. The developer (See definition of "developer" in article 2), who initially may not be familiar with these regulations, first visits the administrative officer to get information concerning the ordinance affecting his proposed development. 
(b)  The administrative officer will show the developer a copy of these regulations. The developer may either review the document in the office or he may purchase a copy for his own use. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 402. - Compliance with zoning ordinance required. 
(a)  No building is to be erected, used, occupied, moved, or altered in a manner that does not conform to the requirements specified for the district in which it is located. 
(b)  The only exception to this requirement is that all buildings or uses which lawfully existed at a particular location at the time these regulations were adopted may be continued as "nonconforming uses." 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 403. - Continuance of non-conforming uses. 
Invariably, at the time a land use and development control ordinance is adopted or amended, certain uses which lawfully existed prior to the adoption or amendment will not conform to the regulations and standards for the districts in which they are located. These are known as non-conforming uses, and in order to feasibly adopt the ordinance and so as not to cause undue economic hardship on owners of non-conforming uses, these uses are allowed to continue under special conditions as outlined in the following parts of this section: 
(a)  Where a non-conforming use of a building or lot has ceased for more than six (6) months or has changed to a permitted or conforming use, further use of the building or lot must be in conformance with the standards and requirements for the district in which it is located. 
(b)  A non-conforming use must not be extended, altered or expanded, either on the same or adjoining property, unless the extension, alteration or expansion is in conformance with the requirements of the ordinance. However, any alteration that reduces the degree of the nonconformance, while not increasing the size of the nonconformance, may be authorized by the administrative officer. 
(c)  A non-conforming use which is altered or extended must meet applicable Lamar County building codes and development regulations. When an applicant seeks a building permit for the extension or alteration of a non-conforming use, the administrative officer will inspect the unit and determine what (if anything) is needed to bring the unit into conformance with applicable building codes and development regulations. Upon determining that the proposed unit meets applicable building codes and development regulations, he/she will issue the building permit for the non-conforming use. 
(d)  If a non-conforming building or structure suffers damage which does not exceed fifty (50) percent of its assessed valuation, the building or structure may be reconstructed and reused as before if done within twelve (12) months from the time such damage occurred. If such damage is greater that fifty (50) percent of its assessed valuation, such a building or structure may only be reconstructed and used in conformity with the standards and requirements for the district in which it is located. 
(e)  A use which is non-conforming only with respect to screening or buffer requirements must provide required screens or buffers within a period of three (3) years from the effective date of these regulations. This time period is to allow for the growth of natural vegetative buffers. 
(Ord. No. 2009-06, § 1, 11-10-09; Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 404. - Building permit required.

(1)  Excavation or filling of a lot for the construction of a building. 
(2)  Erection, movement, extension, or enlargement of a building. 
(3)  Work on an existing building which entails structural change.

(d)  No application will be accepted from any person who is in violation of the zoning ordinance. If an applicant for a building permit is, at the time of such application, determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant does one of the following: 
(1)  He/she must voluntarily remove or change the cause of the violation and cease to be in violation. The applicant must notify the administrative officer that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation. 
(2)  He/she must be tried before a court of competent jurisdiction, acquitted of charges, and present a certified copy of the court order to the administrative officer within thirty (30) days of the final order of the court. 
(3)  When the applicant has ceased to be in violation by either [subsection] (1) or (2) above, the administrative officer will then accept the application for a building permit. 
(e)  Before a building permit is issued by the administrative officer, the Lamar County Health Department must approve the proposed water supply and sewage disposal facilities required in connection with the proposed building or structure. In areas served by a public water and sewage system, the health department may elect to waive the requirement for approval. After study of the site of a proposed use, the health department may require for health reasons that all or any portion of the site not be used for the intended purpose. The health department may also set a minimum lot size larger than that required by these regulations. The Lamar County Health Department will either approve or disapprove the water and sewer facilities within thirty (30) days of receipt of the application from the administrative officer, providing a written decision, including reasons for the decision. 
(f)  An existing use which is altered or extended must meet applicable Lamar County building codes and development regulations. When an applicant seeks a building permit for the extension or alteration of an existing use, the administrative officer will inspect the use and determine what (if anything) is needed to bring the use into conformance with applicable building codes and development regulations before a building permit may be issued. 
(g)  The administrative officer is in charge of issuing building permits. The administrative officer will contact the applicant at the address shown on the application. The building permit will be issued if, upon review of the application and inspection of the site, the administrative officer is satisfied that the proposed project will meet the requirements of these regulations and all other applicable ordinances. The administrative officer may require the submission of additional materials if he concludes additional information is needed in order to determine if the proposed project meets the requirements of these regulations. 
(h)  If the administrative officer feels that the proposed project as presented in the building permit application will not satisfy the requirements of these regulations, he will not issue a building permit. He will notify the applicant in writing within ten (10) days of the submission of the application, stating reasons for the refusal. The applicant will then need to confer with the administrative officer to determine what he needs to do in order to comply with the ordinance and be eligible for a building permit. 
(i)  Construction on an approved project must start within six (6) months from the date of issue of the building permit, or the permit will become invalid and a new one must be applied for if construction of the project is desired at a future date. If construction has begun on an approved project and then ceases before the project is completed, construction must be restarted within twelve (12) months from the time that it was stopped, or the permit will become invalid and a new one must be applied for if construction of the project is desired to resume at a future date. Records of building permit applications and supporting materials will be maintained by the administrative officer. 
(j)  All newly constructed buildings, as well as additions, extensions, or enlargements of structures must comply with all building codes in effect in Lamar County. The administrative officer will explain the procedures and timing of inspections to determine if work meets applicable codes. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 405. - Certificate of occupancy required. 
(a)  A certificate of occupancy is required before a structure for which a building permit has been issued may be occupied or used. The building permit shows completion of the project when the administrative officer, or building inspector signs it in the appropriate space, certifying that to the best of his/her knowledge all requirements of these regulations have been met. The owner/contractor will then receive the certificate of occupancy to be used as confirmation that he has complied with the provisions of these regulations. 
(b)  The administrative officer will issue the certificate of occupancy within ten (10) days of receiving the building permit with required certifications, if he finds that all requirements of these regulations and all other applicable ordinances have been met. However, if he finds that all requirements of such ordinances have not yet been met when the owner/contractor seeks a certificate of occupancy, the administrative officer will not issue the certificate of occupancy. He will notify the owner/contractor within ten (10) days, stating reasons for the refusal. The owner/contractor will then need to confer with the administrative officer to determine what he needs to do in order to comply with these regulations and be eligible for a certificate of occupancy. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 406. - Appealing an action of the administrative officer or planning commission. 
(a)  If the administrative officer or planning commission executes an action which the developer or other aggrieved party believes to be contrary to law, that action may be appealed. Findings of fact, however, may not be appealed. Such an appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days of the date on which the action by the administrative officer or planning commission was taken. 
(b)  The board of appeals has jurisdiction for hearing appeals concerning actions of the administrative officer or planning commission related to these regulations. Applications for appeal may be obtained from and submitted to the administrative officer, who will transmit them to the board of appeals for its consideration. The filing fee for the appeal must be paid at the time the appeal application is submitted. The fee paid for the building permit will be credited toward the appeal application fee if the appeal applicant is the purchaser of the building permit. 
(c)  When an action of the administrative officer or planning commission is appealed, all construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action must be stopped immediately. In certain cases, however, the administrative officer may feel that the stoppage of such construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action will cause imminent peril to life or property. Then, the administrative officer may certify to the board of appeals that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, the halting of construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, the construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action is allowed to continue unless a restraining order is granted by either the board of appeals or a court of appropriate jurisdiction. 
(d)  When an application for appeal of an action of the administrative officer or planning commission is received, the board of appeals will set a time and place for a public hearing on the appeal. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Lamar County at least fifteen (15) days before the hearing. In addition, the parties to the appeal will be notified of the date of the hearing by the board of appeals by U. S. Mail at least fifteen (15) days before the hearing. Any person may appear at the hearing, or have a representative attend instead. A request for postponement or delay of a board of appeals public hearing after the notice of the hearing has already been published in the newspaper will require the requesting party to pay a fee set by the administrative officer sufficient to pay all cost(s) associated with the rescheduling of the public hearing. If the board of appeals tables an appeal to provide either party to the appeal additional time to present evidence for their case, this will be considered as a request for postponement or delay, and will require the payment of a fee as stated above for rescheduling of the public hearing. The board of appeals may waive the additional fee if they table an appeal for reasons of their own choosing. 
(e)  The board of appeals will make a decision concerning the appeal and record the decision in the minutes for that meeting. Further appeal on points of law may be made to the Lamar County Superior Court. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 407. - Variances. 
(a)  A variance is a permit, issued by the board of appeals, which allows use of a parcel of land in a way that does not meet certain requirements for the district is which the property is located. A variance may be granted only in an individual case where an extreme hardship would result if all of the requirements of these regulations were applied stringently to a particular piece of property. The hardship must me proven by showing beyond a doubt that reasonable use of the land is not possible if all of the requirements of these regulations are to be met. The hardship cannot be self-created such as: 
(1)  A lot purchased with knowledge of an existing restriction. 
(2)  A claim of hardship in terms of prospective sales. 
(3)  An expressed economic need requiring a variance, when such a need can be met in other ways which would not require a variance. 
(b)  Relief from the hardship — the variance — must not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes of these regulations. 
(c)  When a variance is issued, the spirit of these regulations must be observed and the public safety and welfare secured. A variance may be granted only for permitted uses in the zoning district in which the property in question is located. (For example, a two-family dwelling would not be allowed to be placed in a R-1 district under a variance.) 
(d)  The developer or owner wishing to request a variance must have at least fifty-one (51) percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing, under the owner's signature. The planning commission or Lamar County Board of Commissioners may also propose a variance. However, the power to approve a variance rests with the board of appeals. 
(e)  Application for a variance must be made with the administrative officer. The administrative officer will take the required information and transmit it to the board of appeals for its consideration. No application is to be accepted from any person in violation of the zoning ordinance. If an applicant for a variance or another action by the board of appeals is, at the time of such application, determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant does one of the following: 
(1)  He must voluntarily remove or change the cause of the violation and cease to be in violation. The applicant must notify the administrative officer that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation. 
(2)  Has been tried before a court of competent jurisdiction, acquitted of charges and presents a certified copy of the court order to the administrative officer within thirty (30) days of the final order of the court. 
(3)  When the applicant has ceased to be in violation by either [subsection] (1) or (2) above, the administrative officer will then accept the application for a variance. 
(f)  When an application for a variance is received, the board of appeals will set a time and place for a public hearing on the variance. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Lamar County at least fifteen (15) days before the hearing. Such notice will state the application number, owner's name, property location, its area, time, place, and subject of the hearing. At least fifteen (15) days before the public hearing, notice of the time, place and subject of the hearing will be sent in writing by U.S. mail to the appellant or petitioner and all property owners within three hundred (300) feet of the subject property. Copies of all such letters will be maintained in the applicant file for permanent record. A request for postponement or delay of a board of appeals public hearing after the notice of the hearing has already been published in the newspaper will require the requesting party to pay a fee set by the administrative officer sufficient to pay all cost(s) associated with the rescheduling of the public hearing. If the board of appeals tables a variance request to provide additional time for the presentation of evidence, this will be considered as a request for a postponement or a delay and will require the payment of a fee as stated above for rescheduling of the public hearing. The board of appeals may waive the additional fee if they table a variance request for reasons of their own choosing. 
(g)  The board of appeals will make a decision concerning the variance and record the decision in the minutes for that meeting. 
(h)  The variance issued by the board of appeals must specify which requirements are to be varied from. It must specify alternative requirements to be met, replacing the requirements varied from. 
(i)  The board of appeals may establish performance bonds to assure compliance with any requirements it has set for granting a variance. Where a variance is granted for a construction activity requiring a building permit, the building permit must be obtained and construction must begin within six (6) months of the issuance of the variance. Otherwise, the variance expires after six (6) months. 
(j)  The decision of the board of appeals on the application for variance may be appealed on points of law to the Lamar County Superior Court. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 408. - Conditional zoning. 
(a)  When a parcel of property is placed in a certain zoning district, all permitted uses for that zoning district are allowed on the property as long as the published requirements of these regulations and other development regulations of Lamar County are met. However, in certain situations, only one (1) of the permitted uses for a district may be appropriate for a parcel of property while many of the other uses within the range of those permitted would not be appropriate — or certain design, location, aesthetic, or other standards may be needed to mask otherwise undesirable effects of a permitted use. In such cases, conditional zoning may be granted by the Lamar County Board of Commissioners. 
(b)  The following situations are permitted under conditional zoning: 
(1)  The use of land may be specifically limited to any one (1) or more of the permitted uses for the zoning district in which the land is placed. 
(2)  Special requirements of design, location, aesthetics, or other considerations may be imposed for the uses permitted on the land. 
(3)  Any combination of the above two (2) categories of conditions may be imposed. 
(c)  Conditional zoning is attached to a specific lot or group of lots—not to the owner(s). If ownership of the lot(s) changes, continued compliance with the special conditions must be maintained by the new owner(s). 
(d)  A tract of land to which special conditions have been attached continues to be subject to all other requirements of these regulations and other applicable regulations of Lamar County which are not in conflict with those special conditions. 
(e)  Whenever a tract of land has had special conditions imposed upon it and a building permit is applied for, plans and specifications which are drawn in compliance with the special conditions must be submitted with the application for a permit. 
(f)  When conditional zoning has been granted for a parcel of property, and no building permit for the property has been applied for within twelve (12) months of the date of such conditional zoning, the property will revert to its original zoning prior to the conditional zoning. However, the owner of the property conditionally zoned may request the Lamar County Board of Commissioners to extend the conditional zoning for up to twelve (12) months. If the Lamar County Board of Commissioners finds just cause for extending the conditional zoning, it may be extended for a period of up to twelve (12) months. 
(g)  The zoning of any parcel of land which is subject to special conditions will be indicated on the official map by its zoning district designation followed by "C" (for example "R-1-C"). 
(h)  Any granting of conditional zoning is an amendment of these regulations, and procedures contained in section 410 must be followed. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 409. - Special exceptions. 
(a)  Some zoning districts permit certain uses only upon approval. These are called "special exceptions." Consideration is given to whether or not the objectives of these regulations will be hindered in an individual situation. 
(b)  The developer or owner wishing to request a special exception must have at least fifty-one (51) percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing, under the owner's signature. The planning commission or Lamar County Board of Commissioners may also propose a special exception. 
(c)  Application for a special exception must be made with the administrative officer who will submit the required information to the board of appeals and the board of commissioners for consideration. No application is to be accepted from any person in violation of the zoning ordinance. There will be a waiting period of seventy-two (72) hours, excluding holidays and weekends for all special exception requests. This waiting period is to allow the administrative officer or other county officials concerned, the necessary time to review zoning and building codes, the Lamar County Land Use Plan, and any State of Georgia law or codes it is obligated and required to enforce or adhere to. Information as to the documents required prior to the public hearing on the request shall be provided by the administrator and/or administrator's clerk. This does not relieve the applicant from providing the required documentation, information, or permits from the State of Georgia or any federal agency for clarification. Should the applicant fail to provide all of the required information or documentation prior to or within the 72-hour waiting period, said public hearing on the request will not be held and there will be a waiting period of thirty (30) days before a public hearing will be scheduled. The administrative officer shall not process or advertise any application for a special exception until all of the required information, documentation, and other required permits have been received and verified by the administrative officer within the waiting period. If an applicant for a special exception or any other action by the board of appeals is, at the time of such an application determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant does one of the following: 
(1)  He must voluntarily remove or change the cause of the violation. The applicant must notify the administrative officer that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation. 
(2)  He must be tried before a court of competent jurisdiction, acquitted of charges and present a certified copy of the court order to the administrative officer within thirty (30) days of the final order of the court. 
(3)  When the applicant has ceased to be in violation by either [subsection] (1) or (2) above, the administrative officer will then accept the application for a special exception. 
(d)  When an application for a special exception is received: 
(1)  The board of appeals will set a time and place for a public hearing on the special exception. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Lamar County at least fifteen (15) days before the hearing. At least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing, notice of the time, place, and subject of the hearing will be sent to the appellant or petitioner and all property owners within three hundred (300) feet of the subject property in writing by U.S. mail. Copies of all such letters will be maintained in the applicant file for permanent record. 
(2)  The administrative officer must post a sign at least two (2) feet by three (3) feet in size in a conspicuous place on the property at least fifteen (15) days, but not more than forty-five (45) days prior to the date of the scheduled public hearing. The sign must set forth the fact that it is a "Public Hearing." It must show the location of the property, application number, the date, time, and place of the scheduled public hearing. 
(3)  A request for postponement or delay of a board of appeals public hearing after the notice of the hearing has already been published in the newspaper will require the requesting party to pay a fee set by the administrative officer sufficient to pay all cost(s) associated with the rescheduling of the public hearing. If the board of appeals tables a special exception request to provide additional time for the presentation of evidence, this will be considered as a request for a postponement or delay and will require the payment of a fee as stated above for rescheduling of the public hearing. The board of appeals may waive the additional fee if they table a special exception request for reasons of their own choosing. 
(e)  The board of appeals will consider the following points in arriving at a recommendation on the special exception: 
(1)  It must not be contrary to the purpose of these regulations. 
(2)  It must not be detrimental to the use or development of adjacent properties, or to the general neighborhood; it must not adversely affect the health or safety of residents or workers. 
(3)  It must not constitute a nuisance or hazard because of the number of persons who will attend or use such a facility, vehicular movement, noise or fumes generated, or type of physical activity. 
(4)  It must not adversely affect existing uses, and it must be proposed to be placed on a lot of sufficient size to satisfy the space requirements of the use. 
(5)  It must meet all other requirements of these regulations. 
(f)  The board of appeals will formulate recommendations to the Lamar County Board of Commissioners, recording them in the minutes for that meeting. The board of appeals will send the recommendations concerning the special exception in writing to the Lamar County Board of Commissioners within thirty (30) days of the close of the board of appeals meeting or the Lamar County Board of Commissioners will assume that the board of appeals approves. 
(g)  After receiving the record of the board of appeals recommendations, the Lamar County Board of Commissioners will then hold a public hearing on the special exception. The same rules apply to this public hearing as to that mentioned in subsection (d) above. The decision may or may not concur with the recommendations of the board of appeals. 
(h)  The board of appeals or board of commissioners may require any additional restrictions and development standards on a special exception as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers and residents. 
(i)  If any restrictions upon which a special exception was granted are not being complied with, the permit may be revoked after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a public hearing. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 410. - Amendments. 
(a)  Any citizen of the county, the planning commission, or the board of commissioners may propose an amendment of the text of these regulations pursuant to the provisions herein. In addition, the planning commission or the board of commissioners may propose an amendment to the official zoning map. If a developer or landowner finds that a proposed new use of his land does not meet the requirements of these regulations, he may request that these regulations be amended to permit the proposed use. During the application process for a residential subdivision, the developer, planning commission, and board of commissioners should evaluate the rezoning of that property to the most appropriate residential zoning district. The developer or owner wishing to request an amendment of the official map must have at least fifty-one (51) percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing under the owner's signature. The power to approve and enact an amendment rests with the Lamar County Board of Commissioners. 
(b)  Each proposed amendment to the official zoning map shall be initiated by filing an application with the administrative officer. The administrative officer will take the required information and transmit it to planning commission and the board of commissioners. There will be a waiting period of seventy-two (72) hours, excluding holidays and weekends for all amendment requests. This waiting period is to allow the administrative officer or other county officials concerned the necessary time to review zoning and building codes, the Lamar County Land Use Plan, and any State of Georgia law or codes it is obligated and required to enforce or adhere to. Information as to the documents required prior to the public hearing on the request shall be provided by the administrative officer and/or the administrative assistant. This does not relieve the applicant from providing the required documentation, information, or permits from the State of Georgia or any federal agency for clarification. Should the applicant fail to provide all of the required information or documentation required, prior to or within the 72-hour waiting period, said public hearing on the request will not be held and there will be a waiting period of thirty (30) days before a public hearing will be scheduled. The administrative officer shall not process or advertise any application for an amendment until all required information, documentation, and required permits have been received and verified by the administrative officer within the waiting period. No application, except one proposed by the planning commission or the board of commissioners, is to be accepted from any person who, or entity which, is in violation of the zoning ordinance. If an applicant for an amendment is, at the time of such an application, determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of the zoning ordinance, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant does one of the following: 
(1)  He must voluntarily remove or change the cause of the violation and cease to be in violation. The applicant must notify the administrative officer that he has ceased the violation and obtains a release from the administrative officer as to the violation. 
(2)  He must be tried before a court of competent jurisdiction, acquitted of charges and present a certified copy of the court order to the administrative officer within thirty (30) days of the final order of the court. 
(3)  When the applicant has ceased to be in violation by either [subsection] (1) or (2) above, the administrative officer will then accept the application for amendment. 
(c)  Applications for amendment. 
(1)  Applications for text amendments shall include the following: 
a.  Name and address of the applicant; 
b.  Current provisions of the text to be affected by the amendment; 
c.  Proposed wording of the text change; and 
d.  Reason for proposed amendment. 
(2)  Applications for zoning map amendments must contain the following: 
a.  A completed and signed copy of the application for the proposed zoning map amendment and all applicable fees. 
b.  A site plan representing information on the location, extent, and type of proposed development, which may include, depending upon the type of development, and in the sole discretion of the zoning administrative officer, the following information: 
1.  A correct scale and north arrow. 
2.  The present zoning classification of all adjacent parcels. 
3.  The location of the parcel relative to existing and proposed streets. 
4.  Required yard setbacks for the zoning district requested. 
5.  Topographic information sufficient to show the elevation and drainage conditions of the land. 
6.  Existing conditions or improvements located on the property. 
7.  The location and extent of the required buffer areas, including the extent of natural vegetation or fences as required. 
8.  The proposed location of all driveways and entry/exit points for vehicular traffic, using arrows to depict direction of movement. 
9.  Commercial or industrial development on existing individual lots, or proposed shopping center developments, shall also indicate the location and dimensions proposed buildings, parking and loading areas, driveways, and storage areas. 
10.  All easements for water lines and sewer lines, both existing and proposed. 
c.  A letter of intent outlining the proposed use and improvements to the property. 
d.  A report from the Lamar County Water and Sewer Authority. 
e.  A report from the Lamar County Health Department. 
f.  A legal description of the property and/or a copy of the deed vesting title in the current owner. 
g.  Any other information that the building and zoning department, planning commission or the board of commissioners may require to properly evaluate the proposed amendment. 
(3)  When an amendment is initiated by anyone other than the board of commissioners, which amendment involves changing the official zoning map or zoning district of a parcel of land, the administrative officer must post a sign at least two (2) feet by three (3) feet in size in a conspicuous place on the property at least fifteen (15) days, but not more than forty-five (45) days prior to the date of the scheduled public hearing. The sign must set forth the fact that it is a "Public Hearing." It must show the location of the property, the present zoning classification, the date, time, place and purpose of the scheduled public hearing. 
(4)  When an amendment is initiated by anyone, including the board of commissioners, notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Lamar County at least fifteen (15) days, but not more than forty-five (45) days before the hearing. Contents of the notice shall include the following: location of the property, the present zoning classification, the proposed zoning classification, and the date, time, place and purpose of the public hearing. At least fifteen (15) days before the public hearing, notice of the time, place and subject of the hearing will be sent to property owners within three hundred (300) feet of the subject property in writing by U.S. mail. Copies of all such letters will be maintained in the applicant's file for permanent record. All requirements of O.C.G.A. § 36-66-1 et seq., shall be complied with. A request for postponement or delay of a planning commission public hearing after the notice of the hearing has already been published in the newspaper, will require the requesting party to pay a fee set by the administrative officer sufficient to pay all cost(s) associated with the rescheduling of the public hearing. If the planning commission tables an amendment request to provide additional time for the presentation of evidence, this will be considered as a request for a postponement or delay and will require the payment of a fee as stated above for rescheduling of the public hearing. The planning commission may waive the additional fee if they table an amendment request for their own reasons. 
(d)  All applications for amendments must first be reviewed by the planning commission. The planning commission will study the proposed amendment and determine if it meets the requirements of these regulations, as well as other applicable ordinances of Lamar County. At this time, the administrative officer may review the proposed amendment and make written recommendations to the planning commission. 
(e)  The planning commission and the Lamar County Board of Commissioners will, when considering a proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance, consider the following standards: 
(1)  The existing land uses and zoning classification of nearby property; 
(2)  The suitability of the subject property for the zoned purpose; 
(3)  The extent to which the property values of the subject property are diminished by the particular zoning restrictions; 
(4)  The extent to which the destruction of property values of the subject property promotes health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public; 
(5)  The relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship imposed upon the individual property owner; 
(6)  Whether the subject property has a reasonable economic use as currently zoned; 
(7)  The length of time the property has been vacant as zoned considered in the context of land development in the area in the vicinity of the property; 
(8)  Whether the proposed zoning will be a use that is suitable in view of the use and development of adjacent and nearby property; 
(9)  Whether the proposed zoning will adversely affect the existing use or usability of adjacent or nearby property; 
(10)  Whether the zoning proposal is in conformity with the policies and intent of any land use plan; 
(11)  Whether the zoning proposal will result in a use which will or could cause an excessive or burdensome use of existing streets, transportation facilities, utilities, or schools; 
(12)  Whether there are other existing or changing conditions affecting the use and development of the property which give supporting grounds for either approval or disapproval of the zoning proposal. 
(f)  The planning commission will formulate its recommendations to the Lamar County Board of Commissioners, recording them in the minutes for that meeting. The planning commission will send the recommendations on the proposed amendment in writing to the Lamar County Board of Commissioners within thirty (30) days of the close of the planning commission meeting or the Lamar County Board of Commissioners will assume that the planning commission approves. 
(g)  After receiving the record of the planning commission's recommendations, the Lamar County Board of Commissioners will then hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment. The decision may or may not concur with the recommendations of the planning commission. 
(h)  The following policies and procedures will be observed by the planning commission and the board of commissioners in conducting public hearings on amendments: 
(1)  All persons who wish to address the planning commission or the board of commissioners at a hearing concerning an amendment under consideration by the planning commission or the board of commissioners shall first sign up on a form to be provided by the hearing body prior to the commencement of the hearing. Any party who wishes to address the planning commission or the board of commissioners through his or her attorney, or other designated representative or agent, that party's attorney or other designated representative or agent shall first sign up on a form to be provided by the hearing body prior to the commencement of the hearing, setting forth the name of their principal and the capacity in which they are appearing before the planning commission or the board of county commissioners, i.e., whether as attorney, parent, attorney in fact, real estate agent or otherwise. 
(2)  The planning commission or the board of commissioners will cause to be read the proposed zoning decision under consideration and any departmental reviews pertaining thereto prior to receiving public input on said proposed zoning decision. Proposed zoning decisions shall as a general rule be called in the order in which they are received by the planning commission or the board of commissioners provided that nothing shall prevent the planning commission or the board of commissioners from changing the order of decisions reviewed at the time of the hearing for the convenience of the planning commission or the board of commissioners, and the public. 
(3)  The planning commission or the board of commissioners shall call each person who has signed up to speak on the proposed zoning decision in the order in which the individuals have signed up to speak, except for the applicant, who will always speak first, or if the hearing body has brought a proposed zoning decision to the hearing, then the hearing body shall speak first. No person shall be allowed to speak in addition to his or her attorney or their designated representative or agent. Each person shall have only one opportunity and time limit in which to speak and said opportunity and time shall be used only by the person or the person's attorney or other designated agent. The purpose of this provision is to disallow additional time, not allowed to other speakers, by use of attorneys and agents, thereby gaining an unfair advantage at the hearing. Prior to speaking, the speaker will identify himself or herself and state his or her current address, and if an attorney or other designated agent, identify his or her principal. Only those persons signed up to speak prior to the commencement of the hearing shall be entitled to speak, unless the planning commission or the board of commissioners, in their discretion, vote to make an exception at the time of the hearing, not withstanding the failure of the person to sign up prior to the hearing. 
(4)  Each speaker shall be allowed a limited amount of time to address the planning commission or the board of commissioners concerning the proposed zoning decision then under consideration, unless the planning commission or the board of commissioners, prior to or at the time of the reading of the proposed decision allows additional time in which to address the planning commission or the board of commissioners on said proposed zoning decision. The applicant may initially use all of the time allotted to him or her to speak or he or she may speak and reserve a portion of his allotted time for rebuttal. A member of the planning commission or the board of commissioners' staff shall be designated as the time keeper to record the time expended for each speaker. Speakers at the hearing shall have five (5) minutes in which to address the planning commission or the board of commissioners. If the planning commission or the board of commissioners desire to ask questions of the speaker, once the speaker has finished speaking on said proposed zoning decision, the time incurred to ask and answer said questions shall not accrue to the speaker's allowed time. Provided however, the questioning body may stop questioning and responses at any time, at which time the speaker must relinquish the floor. 
(5)  Each speaker shall speak only to the merits of the proposed zoning decision under consideration and shall address his or her remarks only to the planning commission or the board of commissioners. The merits of the proposed zoning decision shall include evidence or opinions regarding devaluation, fair market value, nuisance, environmental concerns, traffic, noise, aesthetics, and in general, the health, welfare, and benefit of the community or county as they are affected by the proposed zoning decision. The speaker shall refrain from commenting on unrelated zoning issues and unrelated tracts of land. Each speaker shall refrain from personal attacks on any other speaker or the discussion of facts or opinions irrelevant to the proposed amendment under consideration. The planning commission or the board of commissioners may limit or refuse a speaker the right to continue, if the speaker, after first being cautioned, continues to violate this subsection. 
(6)  Nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting the hearing body from taking reasonable steps necessary to insure that hearings are conducted in a decorous manner, to assure that the public hearing on a proposed zoning decision is conducted in a fair and orderly manner. 
(7)  Prior to the close of the hearing, the planning commission or the board of commissioners shall announce whether it will vote on the proposed amendment at that same hearing or whether it will defer its vote for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days. 
(i)  After reviewing the record of the public hearing and considering recommendations from the planning commission, the Lamar County Board of Commissioners will then make an official decision on the proposed amendment. The decision may or may not concur with the recommendations of the planning commission. So that the purpose of this zoning ordinance will be served and so that health, public safety and general welfare will be secured, the board of commissioners may in its legislative discretion approve or deny the proposed amendment as submitted, reduce the land area for which the application is made, or change the zoning district to one other than that requested. The board of commissioners may also impose conditional zoning on any parcel on which an amendment is requested. 
(j)  If the Lamar County Board of Commissioners denies a proposed amendment, a minimum period of twelve (12) months from the date of the decision must pass before the same amendment proposal is again submitted for consideration. 
(k)  If the developer withdraws the proposed amendment, a minimum period of twelve (12) months from the date of withdrawal must pass before the same amendment proposal is again submitted for consideration.

Sec. 411. - Reserved. 
Sec. 412. - Appealing an action of the Lamar County Board of Commissioners. 
If the Lamar County Board of Commissioners executes an action which the developer or other aggrieved party believes to be contrary to law, that action may be appealed to the Lamar County Superior Court. Findings of fact, however, may not be appealed. Such an appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days of the date on which the action of the Lamar County Board of Commissioners was taken. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 413. - Penalties. 
Any person who violates any of the provisions of these regulations must face penalties. If a developer or landowner exhausts the decision and appeals procedures contained in article 4 and is still dissatisfied with the decision, he must then comply with the final decision or face penalties. Anyone who violated any of the provisions of these regulations, upon conviction, will be fined no more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each offense. In addition, he must pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such a violation continues constitutes a separate offense. 
(a)  The owner or tenant of any building, structure, premises, or part thereof, and any architect, builder, contractor, agent, or other person, who commits, participates in, assists in, or maintains such a violation may each be found guilty of a separate offense and suffer the penalties provided here. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 414. - Remedies. 
If any building or land is used or maintained in violation of these regulations, anyone, including the county, who would be harmed by such a violation, may initiate legal proceedings to obtain an injunction or other appropriate remedy to stop the violation or to prevent any act which would constitute such a violation. Other legal remedies are also available as provided by Georgia law. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
ARTICLE 5. - A-R AGRICULTURAL—RESIDENTIAL 

Sec. 501. - Purpose. 
A-R zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve quiet areas where the primary activities are those of farming, agriculture, livestock, timber cultivation, and related uses consistent with maintaining the land resources of Lamar County reserved for these purposes. Residences of a low-density nature which are incidental to these activities are also permitted. These districts are free from other uses which are incompatible with a low-density agricultural-residential neighborhood. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 502. - Determining if an area is suitable for inclusion within an A-R district. 
The factors contained in section 410 of these regulations must be thoroughly considered by the planning commission as well as the Lamar County Board of Commissioners when determining in which zoning district an area of land is to be placed. This will assure that rational comprehensive planning principles are the basis upon which the decision is made. Land use decisions which are based on sound planning principles encourage the development and preservation of land use patterns that provide healthful and safe living conditions for the residents of Lamar County. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 503. - Boundaries of A-R districts. 
The official zoning map (section 2301 of these regulations) shows the boundaries of all A-R districts within Lamar County. Article 23 also contains additional information concerning interpreting district boundaries, amending boundaries, etc. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 504. - Permitted uses. 
(a)  The following principal uses are permitted in A-R districts: 
(1)  Site-built single-family detached dwelling with a floor space of at least one thousand four hundred (1,400) square feet. 
(2)  Industrialized home with a floor area of at least one thousand four hundred (1,400) square feet.

ARTICLE 12. - P-M PLANNED DEVELOPMENT—MIXED USE 

Sec. 1201. - Purpose. 
(a)  P-M zoning districts are intended to: 
(1)  Encourage the development of large tracts of land as planned neighborhoods or communities. 
(2)  Encourage flexible and creative concepts in site planning. 
(3)  Preserve the natural amenities of the land by encouraging scenic and functional open areas within residential areas. 
(4)  Create a more desirable environment than would be possible through the strict application of minimum requirements of other sections of these regulations. 
(5)  Provide for efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and streets as well as lower development and housing costs. 
(6)  Provide an environment of stable character which is compatible with surrounding residential areas. 
(b)  Within the planned area, a variety of land uses may be permitted in an orderly relation to one another and to existing land uses. This may be accomplished through the application of sound comprehensive planning principles. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 1202. - Determining if an area is suitable for inclusion within a P-M district. 
The factors contained in section 410 of these regulations, as well as data submitted with the development plan of the applicant for a planned development, must be thoroughly considered by the planning commission as well as the Lamar County Board of Commissioners when determining whether or not the provision of a P-M district is appropriate. This will assure that rational comprehensive planning principles are the basis upon which the decision is made. Land use decisions which are based on sound planning principles encourage the development and preservation of land use patterns that provide healthful and safe living conditions for the residents of Lamar County. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 1203. - Boundaries of P-M districts. 
The official zoning map (section 2301 of these regulations) shows the boundaries of all P-M districts within Lamar County. Article 23 also contains additional information concerning interpreting district boundaries, amending boundaries, etc. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 1204. - Permitted uses. 
As shown in the approved development plan. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 1205. - Plan review and approval procedures. 
(a)  Pre-application conference: Prior to filing a formal application for a P-M development, the applicant is encouraged to confer with the administrative officer and the planning commission in order to review the general character of the plan (on the basis of a tentative land use sketch if available), and to obtain information on development standards and ordinances affecting the proposed project. 
(b)  Submission of application for P-M approval: 
(1)  The applicant must file a petition with the administrative officer for approval of the proposed P-M development. This application must be supported by a development plan and a written summary of intent. The relationship between the proposed development and the surrounding area, both existing and proposed, must be shown. The following information must be presented with the application: 
a.  A general location map. 
b.  Existing topographic conditions, including contour intervals of no more than five (5) feet based on field surveys or photogrammetric methods; showing the location or non-existence of any special flood hazard areas (SFHA) with the base flood elevations (BFE). 
c.  The existing and proposed land uses and the approximate location of all buildings and structures. 
d.  The approximate location of existing and proposed streets. 
e.  The approximate location of all existing and proposed utilities, including a preliminary utility and drainage plan. 
f.  The present zoning pattern in the area. 
g.  A legal description of the subject property. 
h.  The location and use of existing and proposed public, semi-public, and community facilities such as schools, parks and open areas on the site. This includes areas proposed to be dedicated or reserved for community or public use. 
i.  Perspective drawings of representative building types; however, this is not required for single-family detached dwellings. 
(2)  If a proposed development creates special problems or involves unusual circumstances, additional information may be required in order to properly evaluate the proposal as follows: 
a.  An off-street parking and loading plan. 
b.  An economic feasibility report or market analysis. 
c.  A traffic study of the area, and a circulation plan within the proposed development as well as to and from existing streets adjacent to the site. 
(3)  The written summary of intent submitted with the development plan must include the following information: 
a.  A statement of the present ownership of all land within the proposed development. 
b.  An explanation of the character of the proposed development; this includes a summary of acres, number and types of dwelling units, and gross density by type of land use. 
c.  A general statement of the proposed development schedule. 
d.  Agreements, provisions, and covenants which govern the use, maintenance and protection of the development and any common or open areas. 
(c)  Review and approval of P-M application: 
(1)  An application for approval of a P-M development is treated administratively as an application for an amendment to these regulations (rezoning). This is because P-M districts are created only upon request of a developer, whose application materials demonstrate a firm commitment to construction of a well-designed P-M development. Upon approval of the P-M development, existing zoning must be changed to a P-M zone, which is an amendment to the ordinance. The amendment procedures contained in sections 410 and 2302 must be followed in granting the amendment to permit the P-M development. 
(2)  The administrative officer will forward the application materials to the planning commission for its recommendations. The planning commission will thoroughly study the materials and make written recommendations to the Lamar County Board of Commissioners, stating the reasons for its recommendations (according to procedures contained in sections 410 and 2302). 
(3)  The power to approve an amendment creating a P-M district rests with the Lamar County Board of Commissioners. After conducting the public hearing and considering recommendations from the planning commission (section 410), the Lamar County Board of Commissioners will then make an official decision on the proposed P-M development. The Lamar County Board of Commissioners may approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve the development plan. 
(4)  If the development plan is approved as submitted, the official map will be changed to indicate P-M district (section 2302). If the plan is approved with modifications, the applicant must file with the administrative officer the following: 
a.  Written notice of consent to the modifications. 
b.  A properly revised site plan. 
(5)  The official map will then be changed (section 2302). The site plan and supporting information of any approved plan will be properly identified and permanently filed with the administrative officer. 
(6)  No building permits will be issued by the administrative officer until the development plan has been approved by the Lamar County Board of Commissioners. 
(d)  Issuance of building permits: The administrative officer will issue building permits for buildings and structures in the area covered by the approved development plan if the proposed buildings and structures are in conformity with the approved development plan, the development schedule, and all other applicable regulations. (See section 404) 
(e)  Revision of development plan after approval of plan: 
(1)  Minor extensions, alterations, or modifications of existing buildings or structures may be permitted after review and approval by the planning commission: Such changes must be consistent with the purposes and intent of the development plan. 
(2)  Any major or substantial change in the approved development plan which affects the intent and character of the development, the density of land use pattern, the location or dimensions of streets, or similar substantial changes must be reviewed and approved by the Lamar County Board of Commissioners after receipt of recommendations from the planning commission. A request for a revision of the development plan must be supported by a written statement indicating the nature of the revision and the reasons it is considered necessary or desirable to revise the development. 
(f)  Approval of P-M revoked if construction not begun: Construction of the planned development must begin within one (1) year of the approval of the P-M. If no construction has begun by then, or if the applicant fails to maintain the approved development schedule, approval of the development plan will lapse. At its discretion and for good cause, the Lamar County Board of Commissioners may extend the period for beginning construction of any phase of the project for one (1) additional year. If approval of the development plan lapses under this provision, the subject P-M district will be removed from the official map (see section 2302) and the zoning districts and regulations which were in effect prior to the approval of the development plan will be reinstated. It is not necessary to follow section 410 amendatory procedures for this action, since its purpose is to correct an illegal situation caused by the failure of the applicant to fulfill the conditions upon which the approval of the P-M development was granted. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 1206. - Development standards for P-M districts. 
In addition to the development standards contained in article 4 of these regulations, the following standards are required within P-M districts: 
(a)  Development plan: Approved development plan must be carried out (see section 1205). P.M. districts must have public water and sewer services available for all lots and structures within the planned community. 
(b)  Density controls: The maximum number of dwelling units per acre in residential areas of a planned development must not exceed 5.5 dwelling units per net acre of residential development within the P-M. (Net residential acreage refers only to land devoted primarily to residential purposes, exclusive of other uses, such as common open space, streets, and lakes. Gross acreage of residential development refers to land devoted primarily to residential purposes as well as open spaces, including private lakes within the P-M held under individual, common, or collective ownership for the use of residents of the residential development. Gross acreage for residential development does not include areas reserved or dedicated for street rights-of-way). 
(c)  Deviation from required densities: 
(1)  The Lamar County Board of Commissioners may allow higher net or gross residential densities, as well as a higher density of a particular residential use, as long as the applicant can show that such a higher density will not be detrimental to the surrounding neighborhood. 
(2)  The Lamar County Board of Commissioners will consider a deviation from the specified maximum density only upon a favorable recommendation from the planning commission. 
(d)  Dimensional and bulk regulations: The location of all proposed buildings and structures must be shown on the approved development plan; minimum lot sizes, setback lines, lot coverages, and floor areas shown on the development plan must be adhered to. The proposed location and arrangement of structures must not be detrimental to existing or proposed adjacent dwellings or to the development of the neighborhood. 
(e)  Perimeter requirements: The Lamar County Board of Commissioners, upon recommendation of the planning commission, may impose one or both of the following requirements to protect the privacy of existing adjoining uses; structures or buildings located at the perimeter of the P-M development must be: 
(1)  Setback a distance of fifty (50) feet from the boundary of the P-M development. 
(2)  Permanently screened in a manner which protects the privacy of existing adjoining uses. 
(f)  Control of area after completion: After completion of a planned development, the use of land and the construction, modification, or alteration of any buildings or structures within the P-M district must conform to the approved development plan. If community needs are found to be changing in the future and a revision of the approved development plan is thought to be needed, procedures contained in paragraph (e) of section 1205 must be followed. 
(g)  Reserved. 
(h)—(x)  Development standards common to most districts are listed under subsections 505(h)—(x). 
(y)  Development standards shown in approved development plan: Other development standards shown in an approved development plan apply only to the development shown on the specific development plan. Such development standards must be maintained. (See section 1205 for related details.) 
(z)  Design standards for all P-M developments: 
(1)  General: Condition of soil, ground water level, drainage, and ground slope must not create hazards to the property, or to the health or safety of residents. The site must not be exposed to objectionable smoke, noise, odors, or other adverse conditions; and no part subject to flooding or erosion can be used for any purpose that would expose people or property to danger. 
(2)  Soil and ground cover: Exposed ground surfaces throughout the development must be protected with a vegetative growth that prevents soil erosion, standing puddles and dust. If this is not possible, such areas may be covered with a solid material such as stone, or other permeable surfaces. 
(3)  Site drainage: The ground surfaces throughout the development must be equipped to drain surface waters in a safe, efficient manner, either through grading or installation of drains. Low impact development (LID) and integrated management practices (IMP) techniques must be part of the P-M development design. 
(4)  Required buffer: A buffer (see definition in article 2) is required along all lot lines of the development. This is in addition to common open space.

ARTICLE 14. - O-1 OFFICE RESIDENTIAL 

Sec. 1401. - Purpose. 
O-1 (office-residential) zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve districts for lower density office activities, with a mix of certain compatible residential activities also permitted. In many cases this district may be appropriate to provide a transition from residential uses where it is elected not to use a buffer for such purposes and where adequate space exists for such a transition area. O-1 development standards require adequate yard space and off-street parking and service facilities. Permitted uses are restricted and protected from encroachment by uses capable of adversely affecting the limited character of the district. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 1402. - Determining if an area is suitable for inclusion within an O-1 district. 
The factors contained in section 410 of these regulations must be thoroughly considered by the planning commission as well as the Lamar County Board of Commissioners when determining in which zoning district an area of land is to be placed. This will assure that rational comprehensive planning principles are the basis upon which the decision is made.

ARTICLE 18. - M-1 MANUFACTURING—LIGHT 

Sec. 1801. - Purpose. 
M-1 (manufacturing—light) zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve physically and aesthetically desirable areas in which clean, low-intensity manufacturing activities may locate and be protected from the intrusion of incompatible land uses. By having such areas available, both new and existing industries may operate and undertake expansion of facilities with the least possible adverse effect on other types of activities which might be incompatible with manufacturing. The elimination of non-manufacturing activities from M-1 districts benefits manufacturing activities by removing some possible obstacles to their smooth operation and expansion.

ARTICLE 19. - M-2 MANUFACTURING—GENERAL 

Sec. 1901. - Purpose. 
M-2 (manufacturing—general) zoning districts are intended to establish and preserve physically and aesthetically desirable areas in which clean, higher intensity manufacturing activities may locate and be protected from the intrusion of incompatible land uses. By having such areas available, both new and existing industries may operate and undertake expansion of facilities with the least possible adverse effect on other types of activities which might be incompatible with manufacturing. The elimination of non-manufacturing activities from an M-2 district benefits manufacturing activities by removing some possible obstacles to their smooth operation and expansion.

ARTICLE 21. - WATERSHED DISTRICTS 

Sec. 2101. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  Findings of fact. In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate with Lamar County and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter storm water runoff can be threatened by unrestricted urban and suburban development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, storm water runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicants, nutrients, and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of Lamar County; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This section shall apply to the portions of watersheds which occur within the jurisdiction of Lamar County and are hereinafter identified as water supply watersheds.

Sec. 2111. - Stormwater management. 
(a)  Stormwater treatment. To the extent any project or development receives a variance under the requirement of this article, the preparation of a stormwater best management practices (BMP) plan and treatment of stormwater may be required. 
If it is determined by the county that the proposed variance or the development may result in the degradation of water quality, a stormwater best management practices (BMP) plan will be required. The BMP plan shall be prepared by a professional engineer and shall be designed to provide water quality treatment for the first inch of water runoff from all proposed impervious areas disturbed by the proposed project. This plan must be approved by the county and the Authority prior to approval of the request for variance. 
Elements of the BMP plan may include, but are not limited to: 
*  Check dams. Dams constructed across a drainage swale or ditch to minimize erosion by reducing stormwater velocity. 
*  Energy-dissipation devices. Paved or riprapped channel sections placed below storm drain outlets to reduce flow velocity. 
*  Water-quality inlets. Specially constructed stormwater inlets designed to remove sediment, debris, oils, and greases from stormwater. 
*  (Other facilities). Such other water treatment facilities that are deemed necessary to treat the runoff water before said water enters the streams of the drainage district. 
*  Buffer zones. Strips of undisturbed, original land or vegetation surrounding the land-disturbed site to reduce stormwater velocities and filter pollutants. 
* Grass swales and filter strips. Vegetative drainage conveyances, used in lieu of storm drains, designed to reduce flow rates and provide filtering/infiltration of stormwater. 
*  Dry detention ponds. Dry surface storage areas designed to collect and store stormwater runoff and to provide settling of pollutants. 
*  Wet detention ponds. Wet storage ponds designed to collect and store stormwater runoff and to provide settling of pollutants. 
*  Wetland plantings. Areas designed to collect, store, and treat stormwater runoff using appropriate wetland vegetation. 
The BMP plan shall be submitted to the county and the authority for its review. The authority's report shall determine whether or not the BMP plan meets the requirements of this article. No development or building permit shall be issued until the BMP plan has been approved by the county. If, during the course of the development, the county finds that the developer is in violation of the BMP plan, the county shall issue a "stop work" order, at which time all development and construction on the project shall immediately cease until the developer is in full compliance with the terms of this article.

Sec. 2303. - Reserved. 
Sec. 2304. - Zoning district designation for additional land annexed to Lamar County. 
(a)  When additional land is annexed to Lamar County, the Lamar County Board of Commissioners will receive a "request for annexation" as provided by O.C.G.A. ch. 36, "Annexation of Territory". The applicant for annexation will also apply for an amendment to these regulations assigning a zoning designation under these regulations for the subject property should it be annexed. 
(b)  All applications for annexation/zoning amendments must first be reviewed by the planning commission. The planning commission will study the proposed annexation/amendment and determine if it meets the requirements of these regulations, as well as other applicable ordinances of Lamar County. At this time, the administrative officer may review the proposed annexation/amendment and make written recommendations to the planning commission. 
(c)  Approving a zoning district designation for annexed property and adding the subject property to the official map involves amendment to the Lamar County Zoning Ordinance and alteration of the official map. The procedures contained in sections 410 and 2302 must be followed in handling such an amendment request. 
(d)  The administrative officer must post a sign at least two (2) feet by three (3) feet in size in a conspicuous place on the property at least fifteen (15) days, but not more than forty-five (45) days prior to the date of the scheduled public hearing. The sign must set forth the fact that it is a "public hearing." It must show the present zoning classification, the proposed zoning classification, date, time, and place of the scheduled public hearing. A notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Lamar County at least fifteen (15) days, but not more than forty-five (45) days before the hearing. Contents of the notice shall include the following: location of the property, present zoning classification, the proposed zoning classification, and the date, time, and place of the public hearing, and it must inform the public that additional information may be obtained from the administrative officer. (Note: This public hearing will be conducted by the Lamar County Board of Commissioners.) 
(e)  All applications for amendment must first be reviewed by the planning commission. The planning commission will study the proposed amendment and determine if it meets the requirements of these regulations, as well as other applicable ordinances of Lamar County. At this time, the administrative officer may review the proposed amendment and make written recommendations to the planning commission. 
(f)  The policies and procedures set forth in section 410 of these regulations must be followed in conduct of the public hearing on the amendment. 
(g)  The planning commission will formulate its recommendations to the Lamar County Board of Commissioners on the amendment and the annexation request, recording them in the minutes for that meeting. The planning commission will send the written record of comments received at the meeting on the amendment request along with its recommendations on the proposed amendment and annexation in writing to the Lamar County Board of Commissioners within thirty (30) days of the close of the public hearing, stating reasons for its recommendations. If the planning commission fails to send its recommendations to the Lamar County Board of Commissioners within thirty (30) days of the close of the public hearing, the Lamar County Board of Commissioners will assume that the planning commission approves. 
(h)  After reviewing the record of the public hearing and considering recommendations from the planning commission, the Lamar County Board of Commissioners will then make an official decision on the proposed amendment. The decision may or may not concur with the recommendations of the planning commission. This decision will be recorded in the official minutes of the meeting. 
(i)  If the application for amendment to set a zoning designation for the subject property is not approved by the Lamar County Board of Commissioners, then no action on the application for annexation will be taken, since the zoning designation of property proposed to be annexed must first be set according to minimum required policies and procedures before property may be annexed. The applicant may then reapply for another zoning district amendment for an alternative zoning designation if he so desires. 
(j)  If the Lamar County Board of Commissioners approves the amendment for zoning designation of the subject property, they will then make a decision on the annexation request. The decision may or may not concur with the recommendations of the planning commission. This decision will be recorded in the official minutes of the meeting. 
(k)  If the Lamar County Board of Commissioners denies the annexation request, the approval of the amendment for zoning designation of the subject property becomes void. A minimum period of twelve (12) months must pass before the same amendment/annexation proposal is again submitted for consideration. 
(l)  If the annexation request is approved, the official map will be changed. Procedures specified in section 2302 must be followed in doing this. 
(m)  Decisions of the Lamar County Board of Commissioners may be appealed on points of law to the Lamar County Superior Court. Findings of fact, however, may not be appealed. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 2305. - Zoning district boundaries. 
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the exact location of the boundary of a zoning district shown on the official map, the following guidelines will be used in establishing the exact location of the boundary: 
(a)  Where a zoning district boundary line as appearing on the official map divides a single lot that was a single lot at the time of the enactment of these regulations, the requirements for the zoning district in which the greater portion of the lot lies must be extended to the balance of the lot. 
(b)  Where a zoning district boundary is indicated as approximately following the corporate limit line of the city, the corporate limit line is the boundary. 
(c)  Where a zoning district boundary is indicated as approximately following a property line or such line extended, the line or lines extended is/are the boundary. 
(d)  Where a zoning district boundary is indicated as approximately following the center line of a stream bed, such a center line is the boundary. 
(e)  Where a zoning district boundary is indicated as approximately parallel to the center line of the street, road, railroad, or the right-of-way of such a facility, the zoning district boundary is parallel to the line and at a distance from it as indicated by scale on the official map. 
(Ord. No. 2010-16, 11-16-10) 
Sec. 2306. - Relationship between official map and Lamar County Land Use Plan. 
(a)  The Lamar County Land Use Plan was prepared by the planning commission and adopted by the Lamar County Board of Commissioners. It should provide the best possible indication of desirable land use patterns that will meet projected future demand for land uses of various types. The Lamar County Land Use Plan supplies a body of information on which decisions on future development may be made that are guided by sound planning principles. The plan does not legally regulate land uses. It contains a land use map, which shows suitable areas for various types of land uses. Actual land uses may not necessarily conform to the land use map. 
(b)  The zoning districts contained on the official map carry standards which must be met by all new development and construction in the county. The arrangements of zoning districts are based on land use information contained in the Lamar County Land Use Plan. Establishment and amendment of zoning district boundaries must be in conformance with the Lamar County Land Use Plan. (This does not necessarily mean a one-to-one correspondence.) This assures that such amendments to the official map are based on defensible findings of fact as well as sound comprehensive planning principles.

ARTICLE 4. - GENERAL PROCEDURES 

Sec. 401. - Generally. 
Within the territorial limits of the county, no person shall subdivide or rearrange a lot line of any lot or parcel of land or grade, install streets, utilities, or make any improvements to a parcel(s) of land without complying with the provisions of this article.

(Ord. No. 2010-04, 3-9-10) 
Sec. 402. - General overview of subdivision plat review and approval procedures. 
A.  Introduction: The procedure for the formal review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of one (1) recommended stage and four (4) required stages. These are as follows: 
1.  Preapplication review (recommended). 
2.  Preliminary plat acceptance by the planning commission (required). 
3.  Construction plan approval by the administrative officer (required). 
4.  Final plat acceptance by the planning commission and board of commissioners (required). 
5.  Recording and dedication (required). 
B.  Exception for minor subdivisions: Subdivisions which do not involve the platting, construction, or opening of new streets, sewers, or water facilities, and subdivisions which do not involve improvement to existing streets are defined as minor subdivisions. They are subject only to the requirements of the final plat stage and the recording and dedication stage. Subdivisions so defined will be accepted by [the] planning commission and Lamar County Board of Commissioners in the form of a final plat, and the final plat must comply in all respects with the requirements of these regulations. 
C.  Pre-application review stage: Whenever the subdivision of a tract of land is proposed, the subdivider is urged to consult early and informally with the administrative officer. The subdivider may submit sketch plans and data showing existing conditions within the site and in its vicinity, and the proposed development layout of the subdivision. The purpose of the pre-application review stage is to facilitate the subsequent preparation of plans and plats by clarifying matters relating to the proposed subdivision, and the development ordinance. Also at this stage, if the proposed subdivision abuts a state highway, the plat must be submitted to the Georgia Department of Transportation (DOT) district office for its review and approval, as required by Georgia Law. 
D.  Preliminary plat stage: The subdivider must submit to the planning commission for approval a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision prepared in accordance with the provisions of these regulations. If the proposed subdivision abuts a state highway, a certificate of approval by the Georgia Department of Transportation must accompany the preliminary plat submission. The subdivider must also furnish copies of such a preliminary plat to all utility companies serving the area. Approval of the planning commission will be indicated on the face of the preliminary plat. 
E.  Construction plan stage: Prior to making any street improvements or installing any utilities or other improvements, the subdivider must submit to the administrative officer construction plans of the proposed subdivision prepared in accordance with the provisions of these regulations. The design presented in the construction plans must be in conformance with the general design information presented in the preliminary plat that was approved by the planning commission. The construction plans must show all street design profiles, topographic information, utility construction plans, sediment and erosion control plans, and other information as may be requested by the administrative officer. The construction plan stage requires the review and approval of the administrative officer in conjunction with the development review committee, as detailed in the Lamar County Land Development Regulations. 
F.  Final plat stage: After completion of the physical development, or arrangements for physical development acceptable to the planning commission, of all or part of the area shown on the preliminary plat as approved by the planning commission, and before selling any lots, a final plat together with the required certificates must be submitted to the planning commission for approval. The subdivider must also furnish copies of the approved final plat to all utility companies serving the area. 
G.  Recording and dedication: After the final plat is approved by the planning commission and the board of commissioners, the final plat and appropriate documents become the instrument to be recorded in the office of the Clerk of the Superior Court of Lamar County, Georgia. After recording, the appropriate deeds and documents must be presented to the appropriate local government agency for dedication and acceptance. 
H.  Road, right-of-way requirements: No approval will be granted for a subdivision or subsequent phase or addition to an existing subdivision unless the property is served by a paved county road, with right-of-way sufficient to meet the requirements of the Lamar County Development Ordinance. The county may, in its sole discretion, accept from the developer a bond or letter or credit from a banking institution located within the State of Georgia in an amount sufficient to provide for the costs of paving the road to the county's specifications as satisfaction of the requirements of this paragraph. 
(Ord. No. 2010-04, 3-9-10) 
Sec. 403. - Pre-application conference and conceptual plan. 
A.  Purpose of conference: Every subdivider/developer should consult with the administrative officer for advice and assistance prior to preparation of a preliminary plat/plan and submittal of an application for approval, as well as inquire as to the necessary documents and materials needed for a plan submittal. 
The purpose of the conference is to familiarize applicants with the development process of the county and the applicable ordinances and regulations necessary to guide a development appropriately. 
For developments requesting access onto state highways, the applicant shall consult with and get confirmation from the state department of transportation. All projects affecting state, county, or any city infrastructure (public streets, utilities, etc.) will need to be coordinated with the affected state, county, or city departments and/or authorities. 
If the property is not in the correct zoning district for the proposed development, in order to continue with the development, the developer/subdivider will be required to apply for the appropriate zoning that is applicable to their request. The rezoning request may be submitted in conjunction with the subdivision application. 
B.  Conceptual plan: The subdivider/developer should prepare and present a preliminary plan after the pre-application conference. The preliminary plan shall be a general design of the proposed subdivision including boundaries of the proposed subdivision and all lots, topographic contours, layout of lots and roads — (including public roads adjacent to the subdivision), size and dimensions of the property and proposed lots (including lot area), delineation of creeks, streams, and all other bodies of water, open space and other planned improvements, and such other information as may be deemed necessary by the building and zoning department. 
The administrative officer shall review the conceptual plan and provide the applicant with the following items within ten (10) working days: 
*Verification of either compliance or non-compliance with the zoning ordinance. 
*Recommendations for improvement of the request with current ordinances and policies. 
*Compliance with the county's land use plan. 
*Recommendations or comments from other county departments, the county health department, and the authority. 
*Recommendations for improvements to the proposed development, its design, layout, zoning adjustments, etc.

Tree replacement, ground cover replacement, or buffer replacement shall be the responsibility of the developer/subdivider in addition to the required landscape plan provided for in the zoning ordinance. The additional amount of the bond/letter of credit shall be set by the administrative officer or, in his absence, by the county administrator. Additional costs to the county outside of the amount of the bond shall be charged to the developer/subdivider and shall constitute a lien upon the property. 
vii.  Duration of bond/letter of credit: The maintenance bond/letter of credit required by this section shall have an initial duration of two (2) years and shall be renewed, in the sole discretion of the board of commissioners, for additional terms of two (2) years. Except as otherwise provided in this section, upon final inspection and certification from the county that all infrastructure work covered under the bond is satisfactorily completed, in good condition, and in compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules regulations, and construction standards, the maintenance bond/letter of credit shall be released. For developments with multiple phases of construction, separate maintenance bonds/letters of credit may be accepted by the administrative officer for each phase. However, where improvements in one (1) phase of a development connect or are integrated into another phase, the maintenance bond(s)/letter(s) of credit given on one (1), multiple, or all phases of development may be renewed, when in the sole discretion of the administrative officer and/or the board of commissioners it is deemed necessary, until certification from the county that all infrastructure work within the development as a whole is satisfactorily completed, in good condition, and in compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and construction standards.

Sec. 412. - Administrative variances. 
The administrative officer may grant the following types of variances, without jeopardizing the intent and integrity of this ordinance and all applicable or related ordinances to a development. The administrative officer shall have the authority to approve a ten (10) percent variance in regards to front, side, and rear setbacks. A ten (10) percent variance on dimensions of a lot or lots may also be granted on no more than twenty (20) percent of all the lots of a development, exclusive of any amenity area dimensions. Variances on open space or other dedicated space shall require approval of the board of commissioners. Variances shall be granted upon the following principles: 
A.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same district. 
B.  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties within the county or within a similar zoning or overlay district. 
C.  Granting the variance requested will not confer upon the property of the applicant any special privileges that are denied to other properties within the county or within a similar zoning or overlay district. 
D.  The requested variance will be in harmony with the purpose and intent of this article, the specific zoning of the property, and the land use plan, and will not be injurious to the general welfare of the community. 
E.  The special circumstances or justifications for the variance are not the result or cause of the self imposed actions or misfortunes of the applicant. 
F.  The variance is not a request to permit a use of land, buildings, or structures which is not permitted by right in the overlaying zoning district or scheme of the land use plan. 
G.  The variance requested is the minimum reasonable variance that will make possible the legal use of the land, building, or structure. 
Minor variances may be authorized by the administrative officer, county administrator, or designated civil engineer of the county concerning the layout of streets, lots, and blocks in situations where physical characteristics of the property create practical difficulty of hardship by strict compliance of the regulations of this article. A consultation with at least two (2) of these individuals, the developer, and appropriate inspectors shall be required as part of the review process of granting a deviation in street, lot, and block standards. A written report shall be followed detailing the reasons why the variance was needed and why it was or was not granted. Such report shall be filed with the preliminary and final plat of the development. 
All other variance requests above and beyond those mentioned in this section shall require approval from the board of commissioners at a public hearing, in accordance with the public hearing procedures as listed in the Lamar County Zoning Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2010-04, 3-9-10) 
ARTICLE 5. - REQUIRED DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 

Sec. 501. - Development standards in general. 
A.  Suitability of land: Land on which there is a danger to health, safety, or property must not be platted for residential use or other use that will continue or increase such danger, unless such hazards can be and are corrected, and a plan to correct such hazard is submitted by the developer and approved by the administrative officer. Examples of such conditions are as follows: 
1.  Land subject to flooding, improper drainage, or erosion. 
2.  Land with excessive slope or other physical constraints which make it unsuitable for development. 
3.  Soil conditions that are not suitable for conventional septic systems. For purposes of this section, conventional septic system means a traditionally used system that is composed of perforated pipe surrounded by gravel or stone masking for the infiltration of effluent into adjoining bottom or side soil areas, but does not include alternative or experimental systems as defined in chapter 290-5-26 of the rules of the department of human resources, on-site sewage management systems. Non-conventional septic systems may be allowed in such a case where feasible, where lot size permits, and only when approved by the county health department and the administrative officer. 
a.  A suitable lot must contain enough useable soil for a primary conventional septic system and a replacement conventional septic system. 
b.  Septic systems shall not cross platted lot lines. 
B.  Name of subdivision: The name of the subdivision must have the approval of the building and zoning department. The name must not duplicate or closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision. 
C.  Access: Access to every subdivision must be provided over a public street, and every lot within a subdivision must be served by a publicly dedicated street or a private street meeting the standards of a public street and approved by the building and zoning department and the road department. 
D.  Conformance with adopted land use plan: Proposed subdivisions must conform with the adopted Lamar County Land Use Plan and development policies in effect at the time of submission to the building and zoning department. When features of the Lamar County Land Use Plan such as sites for schools, public buildings, parks, major streets, or other public uses are located in whole or in part in a proposed subdivision, such features must be either dedicated or reserved by the subdivider for acquisition within a reasonable time by the appropriate public agency. 
E.  Planned developments: A planned development — including large-scale construction of housing units, streets, and off-street parking facilities—may be approved by the building and zoning department, although the design of the project does not include standard streets, lots, or subdivision arrangements, if departures from the normal requirements of this ordinance are consistent with the intent of this ordinance. The developer of such a proposal is urged to consult early with the building and zoning department to coordinate, plan, and plat properly. 
F.  Community assets: In all subdivisions, due regard must be shown for all natural features such as large trees, water courses, historical sites, and similar community assets which will add attractiveness and value to the property, if preserved. In subdivisions of ten (10) or more lots, a community common area or areas with a cumulative total of at least one (1) acre must be provided for use by all residents of the subdivision. No subdivision subject to this section shall contain any less community common area unless the developer has applied for and received a variance from the board of commissioners, as provided in section 412 and/or 703 of this appendix. 
G.  Minimum house sizes: In subdivisions of ten (10) or more lots, at least twenty-five (25) percent of the lots must be reserved for homes of at least two thousand (2,000) square feet of conditioned air space, an additional twenty-five (25) percent (accumulative total of fifty (50) or more percent) must be reserved for homes of at least one thousand eight hundred (1,800) square feet. The third twenty-five (25) percent must be at least one thousand six hundred (1,600) square feet. The remainder must be at least equal to or greater than the minimum allowed in that applicable zoning district. No subdivision subject to this section shall vary from this calculation unless the developer has applied for and received a variance from the board of commissioners as provided in section 412 and/or section 703 of this appendix. 
(Ord. No. 2010-04, 3-9-10) 
Sec. 502. - Development standards for streets. 
All streets established in the county after the effective date of this ordinance must comply with the following development standards: 
A.  Continuation of existing streets: Wherever slope will permit, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision must provide for the alignment and continuation or projection of existing streets into adjoining areas. Existing streets must be continued at the same or greater width, but in no case less than the required width. 
B.  Street names: Streets or roads that are extensions of or obviously in alignment with existing streets should have the same name as the existing street. The names of new streets and roads are subject to the approval of the building and zoning department and must not duplicate or be similar in sound to existing names — even if the suffix street, avenue, drive, etc. is different. 
C.  Development along arterial streets: Where a subdivision abuts or contains an arterial street (See Lamar County Land Use Plan for street-classification plan), the building and zoning department may require a street approximately parallel to and on either side of the right-of-way of the arterial street to provide access to lots along the arterial street, while avoiding direct driveway curb cuts on the arterial street. Such a street may either abut the arterial street or railroad right-of-way, or be located a suitable distance away to allow an appropriate use of the intervening land with a non-access reservation along the arterial street and a buffer. In such cases, lots must have access only from the access street. 
D.  Intersections: The centerlines of no more than two (2) streets may intersect at any one (1) point. Streets must be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. No street may intersect at any other street at an angle of less than sixty (60) degrees. The angle of intersection is to be measured at the intersection of the street centerlines. 
E.  Offset intersections (street jogs): Offset intersections with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet are not permitted. 
F.  Dead-end streets (cul-de-sacs): Local streets designed to have one end permanently closed and not connected with any existing street, proposed future street, or not intended to extend to the property line of an adjacent tract, shall be no longer than one thousand fifty (1,050) feet, unless necessary due to the topography or other physical conditions of the property. 
1.  Permanent dead-end streets: Permanent dead-end streets shall be joined by a cul-de-sac with a paved turn-around having an outside diameter of ninety (90) feet (40-foot radius), and a right-of-way of at least one hundred ten (110) feet diameter. Dead-end streets designed to be permanent and that exceed more than eight hundred (800) feet in length may be required to have a cul-de-sac turn-around midway between the entrance intersection and the end of the street to provide maneuvering for emergency vehicles, when the dead-end street is the only street in a subdivision. 
2.  Temporary dead-end streets: Stub streets which are intended to provide for future development within a tract of land or adjacent tracts shall be required to have a temporary turn-around area having a diameter of at least eighty (80) feet, consisting of six (6) inches graded aggregate base. 
For developments with a temporary turn-around, it shall be required of the subdivider to provide a bond or letter of credit equal to the cost of permanent cul-de-sac construction, in accordance with standards of this section for a period of two (2) years. Failure of the subdivider to extend the street or to construct a permanent cul-de-sac shall result in the county using the bond or letter of credit funds to complete the cul-de-sac construction. 
In his sole discretion, the zoning administrator may require streets within a development to connect. 
G.  Half streets: Half streets are prohibited. Whenever a street is planned adjacent to the proposed subdivision tract boundary, the entire street right-of-way must be platted within the proposed subdivision. 
H.  Split-level streets: Streets which are constructed so as to have two (2) traffic ways — each at a different level within the same right-of-way—must provide any additional right-of-way required by this ordinance when cut and fill techniques have been used in the construction of the street. 
I.  Alleys: Alleys or service drives may be required at the rear of all lots used for multi-family, commercial, or industrial developments, but must not be provided in one- or two-family residential developments unless the alley or service drive is to provide secondary access to a lot whose natural grade is more than six (6) feet above the finished street grade, or unless the subdivider shows the need for an alley or service drive to the satisfaction of the building and zoning department. 
J.  Marginal access streets: These are streets which are constructed so as to provide secondary access only. No more than six (6) lots may abut any such street, and no such street may exceed one thousand (1,000) feet in length. Such streets may not be used as through-streets and should be permitted only when lots abut an arterial or collector street. 
K.  Minimum required street right-of-way width: The right-of-way is the perpendicular distance across a street from property line to property line. Minimum required street right-of-way is as follows: 
1.  Arterial street: *One hundred (100) feet. 
2.  Collector street: *Sixty (60) feet. 
3.  Local street: *Sixty (60) feet. 
4.  Marginal access: *Twenty-eight (28) feet. 
5.  Alley/service: *Twenty-eight (28) feet. 
6.  Cul-de-sac: *One hundred ten (110) feet diameter. 
*See Lamar County Land Use Plan for street classification system and map. 
L.  Minimum required street pavement width with curb and gutter: Curb and gutter shall be installed on all new subdivision roads in accordance with the standards of this appendix. Pavement width with curb and gutter is measured from back of curb to back of curb. Minimum required street pavement width with curb and gutter is as follows: 
1.  Arterial street: *Twelve (12) feet per lane + four (4) feet for curb and gutter. 
2.  Collector street: *Twenty-eight (28) feet. 
3.  Local street: *Twenty-eight (28) feet. 
4.  Marginal access: Twenty (20) feet. 
5.  Alley/service: Twenty (20) feet. 
6.  Cul-de-sac: Ninety-foot diameter. 
*See Lamar County Land Use Plan for street classification system and map. 
M.  Additional right-of-way for cut and fill: Where cut-and-fill techniques are to be used in the construction of a street, the right-of-way width must be increased above the required minimum two (2) feet for each one (1) foot of material removed for the cut or added for the fill. This additional right-of-way must be added to the side or sides where the cut or fill takes place. The maximum allowable degree of slope on a back slope is one and one-half to one (1.5:1), and on a fill slope the maximum allowable degree of slope is two to one (2:1). 
N.  Additional right-of-way on existing streets: In subdivisions that adjoin existing streets, the subdivider must dedicate additional right-of-way to meet stated minimum right-of-way requirements as follows: 
1.  Where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the street, the entire right-of-way must be provided. 
2.  When the subdivision is located on one (1) side of an existing street, one-half (½) of the required right-of-way measured from the centerline of the existing roadway must be provided. 
O.  Construction standards for streets: All streets, alleys, and service drives must be prepared and paved according to the following methods or by equivalent methods that are acceptable to the public works department. 
1.  Base: The base must consist either of select topsoil, sand clay, or other approved material having a minimum thickness of five (5) inches after being thoroughly compacted. The base must be constructed on a prepared subgrade in accordance with these specifications and in conformity with the lines, grades, and typical cross section as shown in the approved construction plans. Special standards for the base are as follows: 
a.  All materials must be of an approved type. 
b.  All materials must be mixed to the extent necessary to produce a thoroughly pulverized and homogeneous mixture. 
c.  As soon as the base material has been spread and mixed, the base must be brought to the approximate line, grade, and cross section, and then rolled with a sheepsfoot roller until the roller walks out. Then the base material must be rolled with a pneumatic tire or general purpose roller until full thickness of the base course has been compacted thoroughly. Defects must be remedied as soon as they are discovered. 
d.  The base course must be maintained under traffic and kept free from ruts, ridges, and dustings. It must be kept true to the approved cross section until it is primed. 
e.  Base material must not be deposited or shaped when subgrade conditions are freezing, thawing, or otherwise unfavorable for stability. 
2.  Pavement: Wearing surface must conform to mixes found suitable by the Georgia Department of Transportation or an independent testing laboratory. Wearing surface must be applied after a prime coat. Unless otherwise approved by the administrative officer and road department, pavement must be constructed as follows: 
a.  The prime coat must be cut-back asphalt or cut-back asphalt emulsion applied on a clean, slightly damp surface in an amount of one-tenth (0.10) to three-tenths (0.30) gallons per square yard, depending upon the nature and condition of the surface. 
b.  The wearing surface must consist of either an approved plant mix prepared in a central plant and composed of aggregate and bituminous materials having an in-place minimum compacted thickness of one and one-half (1.5) inches; or a triple surface treatment consisting of the following materials: 
A first application of AC-10 (three-tenths) (0.30) to four-tenths (0.40) gallons, second spreading of aggregate (forty-five one-hundredths (0.45) to fifty-five one-hundredths (0.55) cubic feet, size M-5), second application of AC-10 (thirty-five one-hundredths (0.35) to four-tenths (0.40) gallons), second spreading of aggregate (thirteen one-hundredths (0.13) cubic feet, size seven (7), third application of AC-10 (fifteen one-hundredths (0.15) to two-tenths (0.20) gallons), and third spreading of aggregate (fourteen one hundredths (0.14) cubic feet, size eight (8). 
3.  Seals: Care and caution must be taken that all points between such structures as manholes and curbs, and the surface mixture are well sealed. 
P.  Reserve strips: Reserve strips designed as non-access reservations to control access to streets or other areas must be dedicated to Lamar County. 
Q.  Buffers: Buffers designed to separate incompatible land uses, as required in certain cases by the Lamar County Zoning Ordinance, must be maintained by the property owner to the specification of Lamar County.

2.  Collector streets: Must conform to standards for class V roads. 
3.  Local streets and others: Must conform to standards for class VI roads. 
U.  Vertical alignment: Vertical alignment (stopping sight distance), measured between points four and one-half (4½) feet above the centerline of the street, must conform to the Georgia Department of Transportation Geometric Design Standards for each class of street as follows: 
1.  Arterial streets: Must conform to standards for class IV roads. 
2.  Collector streets: Must conform to standards for class V roads. 
3.  Local streets and others: Must conform to standards for class VI roads. 
V.  Curb-line radii: At street intersections, property lines must be rounded with a curb radius of twenty (20) feet. However, in situations where the angle of intersection of two (2) streets is less than ninety (90) degrees, the building and zoning department may permit comparable cut-offs or chords in place of rounded corners. 
W.  Right-of-way radius: The right-of-way radius at street intersections must parallel the curb line radius. 
X.  Steep slope development: Street design and construction in areas of steep slopes are subject to variance from the development standards contained in this ordinance if deemed by the building and zoning department to be necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of this ordinance and if so ordered by the building and zoning department. If such a variance is ordered, the administrative officer will establish appropriate design and construction standards on an individual basis. 
Y.  Grading: All streets, roads, and alleys must be graded by the developer in such a manner that pavements and other improvements (sidewalks and curb and gutter, if provided or required) can be constructed to the required cross section. The minimum width of grading must be the pavement width as specified in this ordinance, plus six (6) feet on each side measured from the back of curb or pavement edge: Deviation from the above will be allowed only when due to special topographical (slope) conditions. 
1.  Preparation: Before grading is started, the entire right-of-way area must be first cleared of all stumps, roots, brush, other objectionable materials, and trees not intended for preservation. 
2.  Cuts: All tree stumps, boulders, and other obstructions must be removed to a depth of two (2) feet below the subgrade. Rock, when encountered, must be scarified (broken up and loosened) to a depth of twelve (12) inches below the subgrade. 
3.  Fill: All suitable material from roadway cuts may be used in the construction of fills, approaches, or at other places as needed. Excess materials, including organic materials, soft clay, etc., must be removed from the road-way. The fill must be spread in layers no more than twelve (12) inches thick and compacted. The filling of utility trenches and other places not accessible to the roller must be mechanically tamped. 
4.  Subgrade: The subgrade must be properly shaped, rolled, and uniformly compacted to conform with the lines, grades, and typical cross sections as shown on required drawings and approved by the administrative officer. Unsuitable material must be excavated and replaced with acceptable compacted material. 
5.  Excess dirt: Excess dirt, whether removed during construction of the road or otherwise, shall not be stored on any lot within the subdivision in such a way as to interfere with any easement, right-of-way, utility installation, road grade, or other existing or proposed improvements. 
Z.  Sidewalks: Sidewalks may be required by the building and zoning department on one (1) side of the road in all subdivisions. In any subdivision where lots are less than one (1) acre, sidewalks are required on both sides of the road. Where required, sidewalks must meet the following development standards: 
1.  They must be at least three (3) feet wide. 
2.  They must not be placed immediately adjacent to street curbs. 
3.  They must otherwise be installed according to required construction plans as approved by the administrative officer. 
AA.  Street name signs: Street name signs must be installed at intersections within a subdivision. The location and design of such signs must be approved by the public works director. 
BB.  Street trees: The planting of street trees is desired. The subdivider should plant trees along the street to enhance the appearance of the subdivision.

G.  Commercial and industrial lots: Size, shape, and arrangement of commercial and industrial lots, where platted and classified as a subdivision, are subject to the approval of the building and zoning department. Where public water and/or sewage are not available, minimum lot size and minimum coverage will be based on lot area needed for proper sewage disposal and/or water supply. However, the building setback must be at least fifteen (15) feet from the front property line of the lot, regardless of the classification of the street. Within this setback, no permanent surface structures or facilities are allowed to be constructed.

A.  When allowed: Instead of completing required improvements in a subdivision before seeking approval of the final plat, the subdivider may provide surety for completion of such improvements and proceed with submitting a final plat to the building and zoning department for approval. The subdivider must then complete the required improvements within the period of performance specified by the government authority or forfeit the surety. 
B.  Requirements: To assure the construction and installation of required improvements, the subdivider must deliver to the appropriate government authority a certified check, letter of credit, cash escrow, bond (as defined in section 408), or other acceptable surety — whichever is specified by the government authority — in the amount estimated by the government authority to be the total cost of the construction and installation of the required improvements which are the responsibility of the subdivider.

E.  Default: The subdivider will be in default of the bond if the construction or installation of any improvements or facilities by the subdivider, for which the bond is posted or other surety is provided, is not completed within the period performance specified by the public entity at the time the surety is provided or is not completed in accordance with applicable specifications and requirements of the appropriate entity. In such an event, the entity shall notify the subdivider of the default as provided for in the bond giving it the required time to cure the default. If, after such time to cure, the subdivider is still determined to be in default, the entity shall notify the surety in the manner provided for in the bond and have all rights and remedies afforded to it thereto. 
F.  Certification of receipt for surety for required improvements: A certificate or statement of receipt of surety by the government authority having jurisdiction will be inscribed on or attached to the final plat and executed by the appropriate government authority for the required improvement(s) for which separate surety is provided.

B.  The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship;

ARTICLE I. - GENERAL 

Sec. 101. - Short title. 
This document is entitled "The Sign Ordinance of Lamar County, Georgia." It may also be known by and cited by the short title of "Lamar County Sign Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 2015-14, 12-15-15) 
Sec. 102. - Authority. 
The power of a local government to enact an ordinance such as this, which is intended to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, is provided by the Home Rule provisions of the Constitution and Laws of the State of Georgia. 
(Ord. No. 2015-14, 12-15-15) 
Sec. 103. - Jurisdiction. 
These regulations apply to all land within the unincorporated area of Lamar County, Georgia. 
(Ord. No. 2015-14, 12-15-15) 
Sec. 104. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  Lamar County finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression, and are a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of signs tends to proliferate, with property owners desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises. 
(b)  Regulation of the size, height, number, and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety, to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the county, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the County's citizens. To the extent regulation of signs affects speech protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Art. 1, Sec. 1, Par. 5 of the 1983 Constitution of Georgia, the regulation should be content-neutral on its face; otherwise, the need to regulate must be justified by a compelling government interest and narrowly tailored to be the least intrusive imposition on free speech. 
(c)  The county further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected on public rights of way for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public. 
(Ord. No. 2015-14, 12-15-15) 
Sec. 105. - Content. 
These regulations provide for the following: 
(a)  Establish standards for the location, size, lighting, erection, maintenance, and quality of materials of all signs and outdoor advertising structures. 
(b)  Define certain terms used in these regulations. 
(c)  Provide procedures for administering and amending the ordinance. 
(d)  Provide penalties for violation of these regulations. 
(e)  Define the powers and duties, as they relate to these regulations, of the Lamar County Board of Commissioners, as well as such administrative officers, bodies, and agencies as the Lamar County Board of Commissioners may establish for the efficient exercise of the zoning powers of Lamar County under the provisions specified in the Zoning Procedures Law (O.C.G.A. § 36-66-1, enacted by Ga. L. 1985, p. 1139, Sec. 1.), paragraph 2-(b)-(1). This includes at a minimum the administrative officer, the planning commission, and the board of appeals. 
(f)  Repeal conflicting ordinances.

Sec. 401. - Initial information. 
(a)  Article IV outlines the procedures to be followed in order to comply with the requirements of these regulations. The developer (see definition of "developer" in article II), who initially may not be familiar with these regulations, first visits the administrative officer to get information concerning ordinances affecting his proposed development. 
(b)  The administrative officer will show the developer a copy of these regulations. The developer may either review the document in the office or he may purchase a copy for his own use. 
(Ord. No. 2015-14, 12-15-15) 
Sec. 402. - Compliance with sign ordinance required. 
(a)  No sign is to be erected, used, moved, or altered in a manner that does not conform to the requirements specified in these regulations. 
(b)  The only exception to this requirement is that all signs which lawfully existed at a particular location at the time these regulations were adopted may be continued as "nonconforming signs." 
(Ord. No. 2015-14, 12-15-15) 
Sec. 403. - Continuance of nonconforming signs. 
Invariably, at the time a sign ordinance is adopted or amended, certain signs which lawfully existed prior to the adoption or amendment will not conform to specified regulations and development standards. These are known as nonconforming signs, and in order to feasibly adopt the ordinance and so as not to cause undue economic hardship on owners of nonconforming signs, these signs are allowed to continue under special conditions as outlined in the following parts of this section: 
(a)  Where a nonconforming sign has ceased to be used for more than six (6) months or has changed to a permitted or conforming sign, further use of the sign must be in conformance with the standards and requirements of these regulations. 
(b)  A nonconforming sign must not be extended or altered unless the extension or alteration is in conformance with the requirements of the ordinance. 
(c)  A nonconforming sign which is altered or extended must meet applicable Lamar County building codes and development regulations. When an applicant seeks a sign permit for the extension or alteration of a nonconforming sign, the administrative officer will inspect the sign and determine what (if anything) is needed to bring the sign into conformance with applicable building codes and development regulations. Upon determining that the sign meets applicable building codes and development regulations, he will issue the sign permit for the nonconforming sign. 
(d)  If a nonconforming sign suffers damage which does not exceed fifty (50) percent of its assessed valuation, the sign may be reconstructed and reused as before if done within twelve (12) months from the time such damage occurred. If such damage is greater than fifty (50) percent of its assessed valuation, such a sign may only be reconstructed and used in conformity with the standards and requirements of these regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2015-14, 12-15-15) 
Sec. 404. - Sign permit required. 
(a)  The developer or other person wishing to do any of the following must first apply to the administrative officer for a sign permit: 
(1)  Excavation or filling of a lot for the construction of a sign. 
(2)  Erection, movement, extension, or enlargement of a sign. 
(3)  Work on an existing sign which increases the assessed value of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or more. 
(b)  No public utility hookup will be made available to the site of a proposed sign until a sign permit is secured. 
(c)  The sign permit must be applied for either by the owner of the land upon which the proposed sign or alteration is to be located, or by the contractor doing the work. 
(d)  The applicant may obtain a sign permit application from the administrative officer. He should submit the following information to the administrative officer in application for a sign permit: 
(1)  Completed application form. 
(2)  Plans and drawings showing the area of the sign, size of supports, height, method of attachment intended for use, vertical and horizontal distances between the sign and the finished grade at the site of location, and horizontal distances between the sign and controlling right-of-way lines. 
(3)  A photograph or line drawing of the sign, depicting precisely what is to be portrayed on the sign. 
(4)  Any other documentation which the administrative officer may specify. 
(e)  No application will be accepted from any person who is in violation of the sign ordinance. If an applicant for a sign permit is, at the time of such an application, determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of the sign ordinance, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant does one (1) of the following: 
(1)  He must voluntarily remove or change the cause of the violation and cease to be in violation. The applicant must notify the administrative officer that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation. 
(2)  He must be tried before a court of competent jurisdiction and acquitted of charges and present a certified copy of the court order to the administrative officer within thirty (30) days of the final order of the court. 
(3)  When the applicant has ceased to be in violation by either [subsection] (1) or (2) above, the administrative officer will then accept the application for sign permit. 
(f)  An existing sign which is altered or extended must meet applicable Lamar County building codes and development regulations. When an applicant seeks a sign permit for the extension or alteration of an existing sign, the administrative officer will inspect the sign and determine what (if anything) is needed to bring the sign into conformance with applicable building codes and development regulations before a sign permit may be issued. 
(g)  The administrative officer is in charge of issuing sign permits. The administrative officer will contact the applicant at the address shown on the application. The sign permit will be issued if, upon review of the application and inspection of the site, the administrative officer is satisfied that the proposed sign will meet the requirements of these regulations and all other applicable ordinances. The administrative officer may require the submission of additional materials if he feels additional information is needed in order to determine if the proposed sign meets the requirements of these regulations. 
(h)  If the administrative officer believes that the proposed sign as presented in the sign permit application will not satisfy the requirements of these regulations for size, shape, location or safety, he will not issue a sign permit. He will notify the applicant in writing within ten (10) days of the submission of the application, stating reasons for the refusal. The applicant will then need to confer with the administrative officer to determine what he needs to do in order to comply with the ordinance and be eligible for a sign permit. 
(i)  Construction on an approved sign must start within six (6) months from the date of issue of the sign permit, or the permit will become invalid and a new one must be applied for if construction of the sign is desired at a future date. If construction is begun on an approved sign and then ceases before the sign is completed, construction must be restarted within six (6) months from the time that it was stopped, or the permit will become invalid and a new one must be applied for if construction of the sign is desired to resume at a future date. Records of sign permit applications and supporting materials will be maintained by the administrative officer. 
(j)  All newly constructed signs, as well as additions, alterations, extensions, or enlargements of signs must comply with all building codes in effect in Lamar County. The administrative officer will explain the procedures and timing of inspections to determine if work meets applicable codes. 
(Ord. No. 2015-14, 12-15-15) 
Sec. 405. - Certificate of final sign approval of finished sign required. 
(a)  A certificate of final sign approval is required before a sign for which a sign permit has been issued may be used or maintained. The sign permit becomes the certificate of final sign approval when the administrative officer or building inspector signs it in the appropriate space, certifying that to the best of his knowledge all requirements of these regulations have been met. The owner/contractor will then receive the certificate of final approval to be used as confirmation that he has complied with the provisions of these regulations. 
(b)  The administrative officer will issue the certificate of final sign approval within ten (10) days of receiving notification from the applicant that construction of the sign has been completed, if he finds that all requirements of these regulations and all other applicable ordinances have been met. However, if he finds that all requirements of such ordinances have not yet been met when the owner/contractor seeks a certificate of final sign approval, the administrative officer will not issue the certificate of final sign approval. He will notify the owner/contractor within ten (10) days, stating reasons for the refusal. The owner/contractor will then need to confer with the administrative officer to determine what he needs to do in order to comply with the ordinance and be eligible for a certificate of final sign approval. After the sign is constructed and in place, the applicant must notify the administrative officer within two (2) working days that the sign is ready for final inspection. 
(Ord. No. 2015-14, 12-15-15) 
Sec. 406. - Appealing an action of the administrative officer or planning commission. 
(a)  If the administrative officer or planning commission executes an action which the developer or other aggrieved party believes to be contrary to law, that action may be appealed. Findings of fact, however, may not be appealed. Such an appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days of the date on which the action by the administrative officer or planning commission was taken. 
(b)  The board of appeals has jurisdiction for hearing appeals concerning actions of the administrative officer or planning commission related to these regulations. Applications for appeal may be obtained from and submitted to the administrative officer, who will transmit them to the board of appeals for its consideration. 
(c)  When an action of the administrative officer or planning commission is appealed, all construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action must be stopped immediately. In certain cases, however, the administrative officer may feel that the stopping of such construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action will cause imminent peril to life or property. Then, the administrative officer may certify to the board of appeals that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, the halting of construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, the construction or other activity authorized by the appealed action is allowed to continue unless a restraining order is granted by either the board of appeals or a court of appropriate jurisdiction. 
(d)  When an application for appeal of an action of the administrative officer or planning commission is received, the board of appeals will set a time and place for a public hearing on the appeal. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Lamar County at least fifteen (15) days before the hearing. In addition, the parties to the appeal will be notified of the date of the hearing by the board of appeals by U.S. mail at least fifteen (15) days before the hearing. Any person may appear at the hearing, or have a representative attend instead. 
(e)  The board of appeals will make a decision concerning the appeal and record the decision in the minutes for that meeting. Further appeal on points of law may be made to the Lamar County Superior Court. 
(Ord. No. 2015-14, 12-15-15) 
Sec. 407. - Variances. 
(a)  A variance is a permit, issued by the board of appeals, which allows use of a sign in a way that does not meet certain requirements of these regulations. A variance may be granted only in an individual case where an extreme hardship would result if all of the requirements of these regulations were applied stringently to a particular sign. The hardship must be proven by showing beyond a doubt that reasonable use of the sign is not possible if all of the requirements of these regulations are to be met. The hardship cannot be self-created such as: 
(1)  A sign purchased with knowledge of an existing restriction. 
(2)  A claim of hardship in terms of prospective sales of the sign. 
(3)  An expressed economic need requiring a variance, when such a need can be met in other ways which would not require a variance. 
(b)  Relief from the hardship—the variance—must not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes of these regulations. 
(c)  When a variance is issued, the spirit of these regulations must be observed and the public safety and welfare secured. A variance may be granted only for permitted signs in the zoning district in which the sign or proposed sign in question is located. (For example, a type of sign which is not permitted in an R-1 zoning district would not be allowed to be placed in an R-1 district under a variance.) 
(d)  The developer or owner wishing to request a variance must have at least fifty-one (51) percent ownership of the subject sign or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing under the owner's signature. The planning commission or the Lamar County Board of Commissioners may also propose a variance. However, the power to approve a variance rests with the board of appeals. 
(e)  Application for a variance may be made with the administrative officer. The administrative officer will take the required information and transmit it to the board of appeals for its consideration. No application will be accepted from any person who is in violation of the sign ordinance. If an applicant for a variance or any other action by the board of appeals is, at the time of such an application, determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of the sign ordinance, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant does one (1) of the following: 
(1)  He must voluntarily remove or change the cause of the violation and cease to be in violation. The applicant must notify the administrative officer that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation. 
(2)  He must be tried before a court of competent jurisdiction and acquitted of charges and present a certified copy of the court order to the administrative officer within thirty (30) days of the final order of the court. 
(3)  When the applicant has ceased to be in violation by either [subsection] (1) or (2) above, the administrative officer will then accept the application for variance or other action by the board of appeals and submit it to the board in the manner prescribed. 
(f)  When an application for a variance is received, the board of appeals will set a time and place for a public hearing on the variance. Notice of the hearing must be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Lamar County at least fifteen (15) days before the hearing. Such a notice will state the application number, owner's name, sign location, its area, time, place, and subject of the hearing. At least fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing, notice of the time, place, and subject of the hearing will be sent to the appellant or petitioner in writing by U.S. mail to his last known address. Copies of all such letters will be maintained in the applicant's file for permanent record. 
(g)  The board of appeals will make a decision concerning the variance and record the decision in the minutes for that meeting. 
(h)  The variance issued by the board of appeals must specify which requirements are to be varied from. It must specify alternative requirements to be met, replacing the requirements varied from. 
(i)  The board of appeals may establish performance bonds to assure compliance with any requirements it has set for granting a variance. Where a variance is granted for a construction activity requiring a sign permit, the sign permit must be obtained and construction begun within six (6) months of the issuance of the variance. Otherwise, the variance expires after six (6) months. 
(j)  The decision of the board of appeals on the application for variance may be appealed on points of law to the Lamar County Superior Court.

Secs. 408, 409. - Reserved. 
Sec. 410. - Amendments. 
(a)  If a developer or sign owner finds that a proposed new sign does not meet the requirements of these regulations, he may request that these regulations be amended to permit his proposed sign. The developer or owner wishing to request an amendment to the official map must have at least fifty-one (51) percent ownership of the subject property or be the duly authorized agent of such a person, possessing notarized authorization in writing under the owner's signature. The planning commission or the Lamar County Board of Commissioners may also propose an amendment. However, the power to approve and enact an amendment rests with the Lamar County Board of Commissioners. 
(b)  Application for an amendment may be made with the administrative officer. The administrative officer will take the required information and transmit it to the planning commission for its consideration. No application will be accepted from any person who is in violation of the sign ordinance. If an applicant for an amendment or any other action by the planning commission is, at the time of such an application, determined by the administrative officer to be in violation of the sign ordinance, then the administrative officer will be prohibited from accepting or processing any application from that applicant until the applicant does one (1) of the following: 
(1)  He must voluntarily remove or change the cause of the violation and cease to be in violation. The applicant must notify the administrative officer that he has ceased the violation and obtain a release from the administrative officer as to the violation.

(c)  All applications for amendment must first be reviewed by the planning commission. The planning commission will study the proposed amendment and determine if it meets the requirements of these regulations, as well as other applicable ordinances of Lamar County. At this time, the administrative officer may review the proposed amendment and make written recommendations to the planning commission. 
(d)  The planning commission must then conduct a public hearing on the amendment. The responsibility of conducting the public hearing is delegated by the Lamar County Board of Commissioners to the planning commission under provisions specified in the Zoning Procedures Law (O.C.G.A. § 36-66-1, enacted by Ga. L. 1985, p. 1139, Sec. 1.), paragraph 2-(b)-(1). (See section 105, paragraph F of these regulations for additional details).

After the public hearing, and at an official meeting of the planning commission, the planning commission will formulate its recommendations to the Lamar County Board of Commissioners, recording them in the minutes for that meeting. The planning commission will send the written record of comments received at the public hearing along with its recommendations on the proposed amendment in writing to the Lamar County Board of Commissioners within thirty (30) days of the close of the public hearing, stating reasons for its recommendations. If the planning commission fails to send its recommendations to the Lamar County Board of Commissioners within thirty (30) days of the close of the public hearing, the Lamar County Board of Commissioners will assume that the planning commission approves. 
(g)  After reviewing the record of the public hearing and considering recommendations from the planning commission, the Lamar County Board of Commissioners will then make an official decision on the proposed amendment. The decision may or may not concur with the recommendations of the planning commission. 
(h)  If the Lamar County Board of Commissioners denies a proposed amendment, a minimum period of twelve (12) months must pass before the same amendment proposal is again submitted for consideration.

(2)  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and boundaries of residential districts; 
(3)  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
(4)  Surrounding topography; 
(5)  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
(6)  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
(7)  Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures, as discussed in subsection 502(d) herein; 
(8)  The public goal of rapid private sector development of advanced telecommunications and information technologies, as stated in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 
(d)  Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the zoning appeals board that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's antenna might consist of any of the following: 
(1)  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements; or 
(2)  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height, diameter or design to meet applicant's engineering requirements; or 
(3)  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment; or 
(4)  Applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna(s) on the existing towers or structures, or an antenna on the existing tower or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna; or 
(5)  The fees or cost required to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable (Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable.); or 
(6)  Owners of existing towers or structures are unwilling to accommodate the applicant's needs within reason; or 
(7)  Applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
(e)  Setbacks and separations. The following setbacks and separation requirements shall apply to all towers and antennas; provided that the zoning appeals board may reduce the standard setback and separation requirements if the goals of these regulations would be better served thereby. 
(1)  Towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site occupied residential structure. 
(2)  Towers, guy and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district yard setback requirements. 
(3)  In an AR zoning district, towers over ninety (90) feet in height shall not be located within one-quarter mile from any existing tower that is over ninety (90) feet in height. 
(f)  Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six (6) feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, that the zoning appeals board may waive such requirement if the goals of these regulations would be better served. 
(g)  Landscaping. The following guidelines shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers, provided that the zoning appeals board may waive such requirements if the goals of these regulations would be better served. 
(1)  Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plants that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent residential property. For purposes of these regulations, the standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least four (4) feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound. 
(2)  In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived. 
(3)  Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In the event the tower is located on a large tract, the wooded lot and natural growth around the property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer.
