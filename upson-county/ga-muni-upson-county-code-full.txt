PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Upson County, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Palmer Carr, Senior Code Attorney, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Ed Crews, Chairman, Board of Commissioners, Mr. Truitt A. Mallory, County Attorney and Mr. John Edward Trice, Jr., County Attorney for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

Section 11. - Negotiability, exemption from taxation. 
All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall have and are declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable instrument law of the state. Such bonds are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and the said bonds, their transfer, and the income thereof shall be exempt from all taxation within the state. 
Section 12. - Sale, price. 
The authority may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the authority. 
Section 13. - Proceeds of bonds. 
The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, and unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of any deficit for the cost of the project or projects which, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purposes. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into a sinking fund or used for additional construction as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture.

In the discretion of the authority, revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of any particular project. Any resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this Act shall become effective immediately upon its passage and need not be published or posted, and any such resolution may be passed at any regular or special or adjourned meeting of the authority by a majority of the quorum as in this Act provided. 
Section 17. - Credit not pledged. 
Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of either the City of Thomaston or Upson County, or any municipality therein, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the said city or county, or any municipality therein, to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for such payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. 
Section 18. - Trust indenture as security. 
In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority, including the proceeds derived from the sale from time to time of any surplus property of the authority, both real and personal. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insuring of the property, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys, including the proceeds derived from the sale or lease of property of the authority, both real and personal, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues or other moneys be satisfactory to such purchasers, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
Section 19. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
The authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank, or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds to hold and apply the same to the purposes thereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolutions or trust indentures may provide. 
Section 20. - Sinking fund. 
The revenues, fees, tolls, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued and any moneys derived from the sale or lease of any properties, both real and personal, of the authority, unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on such revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust instrument may provide, and such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture into a sinking fund, which said sinking fund shall be pledged to, and charged with, the payment of (1) the interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary charges of a paying agent or agents for paying interest and principal, (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as hereinabove provided, and (5) any other reasonable or necessary costs or expenses relating to such bond issue. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, however, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and shall not again be issued. 
Section 21. - Remedies of bondholders. 
Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished.

Section 23. - Validation.

Section 24. - Venue and jurisdiction. 
Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any suit or action against such authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Upson County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall likewise be brought in said court. 
Section 25. - Interest of bondholders protected. 
While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of said authority or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency, or authority shall be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds and, upon the issuance of bonds hereunder, the provisions hereof shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds. 
Section 26. - Moneys received considered trust funds.

In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose signature shall appear on any coupon shall cease to be such officer before delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. 
Section 8. - Revenue bonds; negotiability; exemption from taxation. 
All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall have and are declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under laws of this state.

Section 13. - Credit not pledged. 
Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not constitute a debt of Upson County or any municipality in Upson County, nor a pledge of the faith and credit of said county or any such municipality, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund provided for in this Act and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate said county or any such municipality to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment, and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. 
Section 14. - Trust indenture as security. 
In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company inside or outside of the state. Such trust indenture may pledge or assign fees, tolls, revenues, and earnings to be received by the authority. Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the project affected by such indenture.

The authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who or any agency, bank, or trust company which shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes provided for in this Act, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. 
Section 16. - Sinking fund. 
The revenues, fees, tolls, and earnings derived from any particular project or projects, regardless of whether or not such fees, earnings, and revenues were produced by a particular project for which bonds have been issued unless otherwise pledged and allocated, may be pledged and allocated by the authority to the payment of the principal and interest on revenue bonds of the authority as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust instrument may provide, and such funds so pledged from whatever source received, which said pledge may include funds received from one or more or all sources, shall be set aside at regular intervals as may be provided in the resolution or trust indenture into a sinking fund, which said sinking fund shall be pledged to and charged with the payment of: 
(1)	The interest upon which revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due; 
(2)	The principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due; 
(3)	Any premium upon bonds acquired by redemption, payment, or otherwise;

The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, any surplus moneys in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be canceled and shall not be reissued, printed, and delivered. 
Section 17. - Remedies of bondholders. 
Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights given by this Act may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted by this Act or under such resolution or trust indenture, and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture, to be performed by the authority, or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging, and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls, fines, and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished.

The issuance of such funding or refunding bonds, the maturities and all other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the duties of the authority in respect to the same shall be governed by the foregoing provisions of this Act insofar as the same may be applicable. 
Section 19. - Venue and jurisdiction. 
Any action to protect or enforce any rights under the provisions of this Act or any suit or action against such authority shall be brought in the Superior Court of Upson County, Georgia, and any action pertaining to validation of any bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall likewise be brought in said court which shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction of such actions.

Section 21. - Interest of bondholders protected. 
(a)	While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties, or existence of said authority or of its officers, employees, or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, and no other entity, department, agency, or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds, nor will the state itself so compete with the authority. 
(b)	The provisions of this Act shall be for the benefit of the authority and the holders of any such bonds and, upon the issuance of bonds under the provisions of this Act, shall constitute a contract with the holders of such bonds.

The tax commissioner shall provide affidavit forms for this purpose. The exemption granted to the homestead within this section shall extend to and shall apply to those properties the legal title to which is vested in one or more titleholders, if actually occupied by one or more such owners as a residence and one or more such titleholders possesses the qualifications provided for in this section. In such instances, such exemptions shall be granted to such properties if claimed in the manner provided in this section by one or more of the owners actually residing on such property.

--- (7) --- 
Editor's note— Printed herein is 1988 Ga. Laws, page 3821, which grants a homestead exemption for residents who are disabled and whose income does not exceed $10,000.00. Amendments to the Act are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original Act. Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines and citations to state statutes has been used. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 

Section 1. - Exemption from ad valorem taxes granted; exceptions. 
(a)	In addition to any other homestead exemption authorized by law, each resident of Upson County who is disabled is granted an exemption from all Upson County ad valorem taxes, including taxes to retire bonded indebtedness but excluding ad valorem taxes for the Upson County School District, in the amount of $10,000.00 on a homestead owned and occupied by him as a residence if his adjusted gross income, together with the adjusted gross income of his spouse who also occupies and resides at such homestead, does not exceed $10,000.00 for the immediately preceding taxable year. For the purposes of this section, the term "adjusted gross income" shall have the same meaning as that term is defined in the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as now or hereafter amended. The value of the residence in excess of the above-exempted amount shall remain subject to taxation. In order to qualify for the exemption provided for in this section as being disabled, the person claiming such exemption shall be required to obtain a certificate from not more than two physicians licensed to practice medicine under the laws of Georgia, as now or hereafter amended, certifying that in the opinion of such physician or physicians such person is mentally or physically incapacitated to the extent that such person is unable to be gainfully employed and that such incapacity is likely to be permanent. Any such owner shall not receive the benefits of such homestead exemption unless he or his agent files an affidavit with the tax commissioner of Upson County, giving the certificate or certificates provided for in this section, the amount of income which he and his spouse received during the last taxable year for income tax purposes, and such additional information relative to receiving the benefits of such exemption as will enable the tax commissioner to make a determination as to whether such owner is entitled to such exemption. The tax commissioner shall provide affidavit forms for this purpose. Such applications shall be processed in the same manner as other applications for homestead exemption, and the provisions of law applicable to the processing of homestead exemptions, as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, shall apply thereto, provided that, after any such owner has filed the proper certificate or certificates as provided above and has been allowed the exemption provided in this section, it shall not be necessary that he make application and file the said affidavit and certificate thereafter for any year and the said exemption shall continue to be allowed to such owner. It shall be the duty of any such owner, however, to notify the tax commissioner in the event he becomes ineligible for any reason for the exemption provided in this section. 
(b)	The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to disabled veterans who shall be entitled to the homestead exemption granted especially to disabled veterans. 
Section 2. - Applicability. 
This Act shall apply to all tax years beginning on or after January 1, 1989.

Section 1. - Exemption from ad valorem taxes for educational purposes granted to disabled residents; exceptions. 
(a)	In addition to any other homestead exemption authorized by law, each resident of the Upson County School District who is disabled is granted an exemption from all ad valorem taxes for educational purposes, including taxes to retire bonded indebtedness, in the amount of $10,000.00 on a homestead owned and occupied by him as a residence if his adjusted gross income, together with the adjusted gross income of his spouse who also occupies and resides at such homestead, does not exceed $10,000.00 for the immediately preceding taxable year. For the purposes of this section, the term "adjusted gross income" shall have the same meaning as that term is defined in the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as now or hereafter amended. The value of the residence in excess of the above-exempted amount shall remain subject to taxation. In order to qualify for the exemption provided for in this section as being disabled, the person claiming such exemption shall be required to obtain a certificate from not more than two physicians licensed to practice medicine under the laws of Georgia, as now or hereafter amended, certifying that in the opinion of such physician or physicians such person is mentally or physically incapacitated to the extent that such person is unable to be gainfully employed and that such incapacity is likely to be permanent. Any such owner shall not receive the benefits of such homestead exemption unless he or his agent files an affidavit with the tax commissioner of Upson County, giving the certificate or certificates provided for in this section, the amount of income which he and his spouse received during the last taxable year for income tax purposes, and such additional information relative to receiving the benefits of such exemption as will enable the tax commissioner to make a determination as to whether such owner is entitled to such exemption. The tax commissioner shall provide affidavit forms for this purpose. Such applications shall be processed in the same manner as other applications for homestead exemption, and the provisions of law applicable to the processing of homestead exemptions, as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, shall apply thereto, provided that, after any such owner has filed the proper certificate or certificates as provided above and has been allowed the exemption provided in this section, it shall not be necessary that he make application and file the said affidavit and certificate thereafter for any year and the said exemption shall continue to be allowed to such owner. It shall be the duty of any such owner, however, to notify the tax commissioner in the event he becomes ineligible for any reason for the exemption provided in this section. 
(b)	The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to disabled veterans who shall be entitled to the homestead exemption granted especially to disabled veterans. 
Section 2. - Applicability. 
This Act shall apply to all tax years beginning on or after January 1, 1989.

Section 1. - Constitutional amendment. 
Article VII, Section I, Paragraph IV of the Constitution [Ga. Const. art. VII, § I, ¶ IV] is hereby amended by adding at the end thereof the following paragraph: 
"The homestead of each resident of the Upson County School District who is sixty-two years of age or over and who does not have a gross income from all sources, including the gross income of all members of the family residing within said homestead, exceeding $8,000.00 per annum, is hereby exempt from all ad valorem taxation for educational purposes levied for and in behalf of such school system, including taxes to retire school bond indebtedness, which exemption shall be in the same amount as may now or hereafter be exempted by general law enacted pursuant to the provisions of this Paragraph IV of Section I of Article VII of the Constitution relating to the homestead of county school district residents who are sixty-two years of age or older with income below certain limits. The exemption granted by this Paragraph shall be in the same amount as the exemption granted by said general law and shall be in lieu of, and not in addition to, said exemption granted by general law. The value of the homestead in excess of the above exempted amount shall remain subject to taxation. No such exemption shall be granted unless an affidavit of the owner of the homestead is filed with the Tax Commissioner of Upson County giving his age, the amount of gross income which he received for the immediately preceding calendar year, the gross income which the members of his family residing within the homestead received for such period, and such other additional information relative to receiving the benefits of the exemption granted by this Paragraph as will enable the tax commissioner to make a determination as to whether such owner is entitled to said exemption. The tax commissioner shall provide affidavit forms for this purpose. The exemption granted to the homestead within this Paragraph shall extend to and shall apply to those properties, the legal title to which is vested in one or more titleholders, if actually occupied by one or more such owners as a residence, and one or more such titleholders possesses the qualifications provided for in this Paragraph. In such instances, such exemptions shall be granted to such properties, if claimed in the manner herein provided by one or more of the owners actually residing on such property. Such exemptions shall also extend to those homesteads, the title to which is vested in an administrator, executor, or trustee, if one or more of the heirs or cestui que uses residing on such property shall possess the qualifications provided for herein and shall claim the exemptions granted by this Paragraph in the manner herein provided. The exemption provided for herein shall apply to all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1980. The General Assembly may provide by law for the proper administration of this exemption including penalties necessary therefor."

Laws, page 360), as amended, that occur within the boundaries of the County of Upson.

Laws, page 360), as amended, and enforcement of this Act shall be by the same procedures as are set forth for the enforcement of the Georgia Retailers' and Consumers' Sales and Use Tax Act, approved February 20, 1951 (1951 Ga. Laws, page 360), as amended.

Laws, page 360), as amended; provided, however, that all moneys collected from each taxpayer by the State Revenue Commissioner shall be first applied to such taxpayer's liability for taxes owed to the State of Georgia.

During the year 1979, which is the initial year that the tax imposed by this Act shall be effective, the governing authority of the County of Upson shall adjust the mill rate for county ad valorem taxation, which adjustment shall be equal in portions of Upson County which are inside the boundaries of any municipality and in portions of the county that are outside the boundaries of any municipality. The adjustment in the mill rate shall be made in the following manner: 
(a)	The governing authority of the County of Upson shall first determine from the State Revenue Commissioner the total amount of the tax collected on all items, transactions and uses in the County of Upson under the Georgia Retailers' and Consumers' Sales and Use Tax Act, approved February 20, 1951 (1951 Ga. Laws, page 360), as amended, during the calendar year 1978. The tax collected during 1978, as aforesaid, shall then be divided by three. The resulting quotient shall equal the anticipated proceeds of the tax established by this Act, for the calendar year 1979. 
(b)	The governing authority of the County of Upson shall next determine a mill rate on tangible property in the County of Upson that, if levied, would produce sufficient funds for county operations and maintenance, taking into account all other fines, forfeitures, fees, taxes and revenues of every kind collected or anticipated by the county during the year in which the tax is to be imposed, but in the absence of the anticipated proceeds of the tax imposed by this Act. 
(c)	The governing authority of the County of Upson shall next determine a mill rate on tangible property in the County of Upson that would, if levied, produce funds in an amount equal to the anticipated proceeds of the tax imposed by this Act for the year 1979. 
(d)	The mill rate levied by the governing authority of the County of Upson for the year 1979 shall be the mill rate that results by subtracting the mill rate that, if levied, would produce funds in an amount equal to the anticipated proceeds of the tax imposed by this Act for the year 1979, from the mill rate that, if levied, would produce sufficient funds for county operations and maintenance, taking into account additional county funds as set forth in Section 4(b) herein, but in the absence of the anticipated proceeds of the tax imposed by this Act. 
Section 5. - Adjustment of mill rate after 1979. 
For the years following 1979 the governing authority of Upson County shall adjust the mill rate for county ad valorem taxation, which adjustment shall be equal both inside the boundaries of any municipality and outside the boundaries of any municipality, in the following manner: 
(a)	The governing authority of Upson County shall determine a mill rate on tangible property in Upson County that, if levied, would produce sufficient funds for county operations and maintenance, taking into account all other fines, forfeitures, fees, taxes and revenues of every kind collected or anticipated by the county for the year for which the mill rate is fixed, but in the absence of the proceeds of the tax imposed by this Act. 
(b)	The governing authority of Upson County shall next determine a mill rate on tangible property in the County of Upson that, if levied, would produce funds in an amount equal to the portion of the proceeds of the tax imposed by this Act, that were disbursed by the State Revenue Commissioner to the governing authority of the County of Upson for the preceding year. 
(c)	The mill rate levied by the governing authority of Upson County for all years following 1979, which mill rate shall be equal both as to property inside the boundaries of any municipality and outside the boundaries of any municipality, shall be that mill rate that results from subtracting the mill rate that, if levied, would produce funds in an amount equal to the county's portion of the proceeds of the tax received under this Act for the preceding year, from the mill rate that the governing authority shall have determined to be necessary to produce sufficient funds for the county's operations and maintenance, taking into account all other fines, forfeitures, fees, taxes and revenues of every kind collected or anticipated by the county for the year for which the mill rate is fixed, but in the absence of the county's portion of the proceeds of the tax imposed by this Act. 
Section 6. - Effect of mill rate reduction to zero. 
If as a result of Sections 4 and 5 of this Act, the mill rate levied for county operations and maintenance on tangible property shall be reduced to zero, then any funds derived from the tax imposed by this Act which remain in the county general fund may be expended by the governing authority of the County of Upson for any lawful governmental purpose, including the retirement of bonded indebtedness. In the event that the tax imposed by this Act should cause the mill rate to be reduced to zero, then said county shall continue to maintain the offices of tax assessor and tax commissioner and all other functions of tax assessment and tax collection in the same manner as if ad valorem taxes were to be paid to the county. 
Section 7. - Statement of reduction of county ad valorem property taxes on tax bill. 
The taxing authority of the County of Upson shall show in a prominent manner on the tax bill of each ad valorem taxpayer the dollar amount of the reduction of county ad valorem property taxes which such taxpayer has received as a result of the tax imposed by this Act. 
Section 8. - Payment of tax on tangible personal property in another jurisdiction. 
Where a local sales or use tax has been paid with respect to tangible personal property by the purchaser thereof, either in another local taxing jurisdiction within the State or in a taxing jurisdiction outside the State, where the purpose of the tax is similar in purpose and intent to the tax authorized to be imposed by this Act, said tax may be credited against the tax authorized to be imposed by this Act, upon the same property. If the amount of sales or use tax so paid is less than the amount of the use tax due as authorized to be imposed by this Act, the purchaser shall pay an amount equal to the difference between the amount so paid in the other taxing jurisdiction and the amount due as authorized to be imposed by this Act. The State Revenue Commissioner may require such proof of payment in another local taxing jurisdiction as is deemed to be necessary and proper. 
Section 9. - Exemptions. 
No tax shall be imposed upon the sale of tangible personal property which is ordered by and delivered to the purchaser at a point outside the boundaries of Upson County, regardless of the point at which title passes, if such delivery is made by the seller's vehicle, U. S. mail, common carrier or by private contract carrier licensed by the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Georgia Public Service Commission. 
Section 10. - Contents of return. 
Each sales tax return remitting taxes collected hereunder shall separately identify the location of each retail establishment at which establishment any of the taxes remitted were collected and shall specify the amount of sales and the amount of taxes collected at each such establishment for the period concerned by the return so as to thereby facilitate determination by the Revenue Commissioner that all taxes imposed by this Act are collected and distributed according to situs of sale. 
Section 11. - Legislative authority; effective date. 
The Act is enacted pursuant to the terms and provisions of a certain amendment to the Constitution of Georgia, as amended, proposed by the General Assembly of Georgia of 1978 and submitted as is provided in Article XII, Section I, Paragraph I of the Constitution of the State of Georgia of 1976 [Ga. Const. art. XII, § I, ¶ I] for vote thereon at the general election of 1978, which amendment gives to the General Assembly the power and authority to enact such legislation and this Act shall become effective only if said amendment shall be ratified and adopted at said general election of 1978 as provided by law, and if so ratified and adopted, this Act shall become effective January 1, 1979. 
Section 12. - Effect of statewide increase in tax. 
In the event that the State of Georgia, during the year 1978, or in any subsequent year, shall impose a statewide increase in the sales and use tax, so that the tax imposed by the State of Georgia throughout the State shall be greater than three percent, then, at such time as the statewide increase shall become effective, the sales and use tax of one percent in and for the County of Upson, imposed by this Act, shall be ineffective, and no tax imposed by this Act shall thereafter be collected. 
Section 13. - Conflicting laws. 
All laws and parts of laws in conflict herewith are hereby repealed; provided, however, should this Act be held to be unconstitutional then the repeal of existing laws shall not be effective and all such laws shall remain of force as though this Act had not been passed. For as long as this Act shall be in effect, Section 26A of the Georgia Retailers' and Consumers' Sales and Use Tax Act (1975 Ga. Laws, page 984) shall not be effective in the County of Upson.

(1)	Establish guidelines for ethical standards of conduct for all county officials; 
(2)	Establish guidelines for the conduct that is to be expected of county officials at meetings, events, and appearances sponsored by Upson County; 
(3)	Require disclosure of all conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, by county officials in matters concerning or affecting Upson County; and

(b)	The provisions of this code of ethics shall be applicable to the following county officials: the chairman and members of the board of commissioners; members of the planning commission, water and sewer authority, the board of tax assessors, and any additional board(s) that may be established and duly appointed by the board of commissioners. The provisions of this code of ethics are also applicable to the county's appointees to the recreation commission, airport authority, industrial authority, and any other board or authority to which the board of commissioners makes appointments. 
(c)	No county official shall: 
(1)	Provide reason by his or her conduct for the impression that any person can improperly influence him or her or unduly enjoy his or her favor in the performance of official acts; 
(2)	Use his or her official position to secure or attempt to secure privileges that are not available to the general public; 
(3)	Perform any activity or engage in any transaction that is prohibited by law now existing or hereafter enacted which is applicable to him or her by virtue of being a county official; 
(4)	Directly or indirectly request, exact, receive, or agree to receive a loan, gift, favor, promise, or thing of value for himself or herself or another person if it could reasonably be considered to influence the county official in the discharge of official duties.

(6)	Engage in, or accept employment with, or render services for any private business or professional activity when such employment or rendering of services is adverse to and incompatible with the proper discharge of official duties. This shall not apply to a county official who is a licensed professional and appears on behalf of any applicant in such professional capacity so long as disclosures required by subsection (d) are made to the board of commissioners 30 days prior to any action being taken, and the member is associated with the project at the time the initial application is filed;

(d)	An appointed county official (i.e., members of the planning commission and other boards appointed by the board of commissioners) who has a financial interest that he or she has reason to believe may be affected by his or her official acts or actions shall disclose the precise nature of such financial interest by written or verbal statement 30 days prior to the board of commissioners taking official action on a matter affecting such interest, and shall abstain from discussion and voting. An elected county official (i.e., the chairman and members of the board of commissioners) shall disclose the nature of any financial interest he or she has at the time such matter is presented to the board of commissioners for discussion. Such written or verbal statements shall be recorded into the minutes of the meeting and thus become part of the public record.

(e)	The board of commissioners shall not enter into any contract involving services or property with a member of the board of commissioners or with a business in which a member of the board of commissioners has a significant financial interest. This shall not apply in the case of the designation of a bank or trust company as a depository of county funds; the borrowing of funds from any bank or lending institution which offers the lowest available rate of interest in the community for such loan; contracts entered into in accordance with the Official Code of Georgia Annotated; or contracts entered into under circumstances that constitute an emergency situation, provided that the county manager or his designee prepares a written record explaining the emergency.

(1)	Be found guilty of the county's policy prohibiting the possession or consumption by employees of alcohol or illegal substance in any county facility, vehicle or work site;

(3)	Intentionally and/or repeatedly violate Robert's Rules of Order, the general guidelines by which the board of commissioners and appointed boards of the county conduct their meetings. 
(g)	This code section is not intended to apply in the following circumstances: 
(1)	County officials are also members of society and, therefore, share the same general personal and economic interests in the decisions and policies of government as all members of the community do; 
(2)	County officials retain their rights to publicly express their views on matters of general public interest, and to express their opinions on the effect of public actions on their personal or economic interests or rights; 
(3)	It is sound public policy for standards of ethical conduct for county officials to distinguish between those minor and inconsequential conflicts that are unavoidable in a free society, and those conflicts which are personal, material, and avoidable; 
(4)	County officials are entitled to engage in employment, professional or business activities, other than official duties, in order to support themselves and their families and to maintain a continuity of professional or business activity, and are entitled to maintain their investments; and 
(5)	It is possible and reasonable to require county officials to engage in employment, professional or business activities and to maintain investments which do not impede or undermine the integrity of their service to the community. 
(h)	Upon the sworn complaint of any person alleging facts that, if proven to be true, would constitute a violation of this Code section as determined by the county manager and the county attorney, the board of commissioners shall conduct a public hearing at which the accused county official shall be given an opportunity to be heard, either personally or through counsel. At the conclusion of the hearing, the board of commissioners shall, in written findings of fact and conclusions based thereon, make a determination concerning the propriety of the conduct of the county official in question. The primary actions available to the board of commissioners concerning a determined instance of violation by a county official of this Code section are: 
(1)	Written and oral reprimand or similar public censure by the board of commissioners; and 
(2)	Request for resignation by the board of commissioners.

(Ord. No. 56, § IV, 9-21-1990) 
Sec. 18-32. - Land use restrictions. 
No use shall be proposed or developed within the 65 Ldn contour of the Thomaston-Upson County Airport Hazard Zoning Map unless compliance is compatible and consistent with noise exposures for the various land uses in section 18-36. 
(Ord. No. 56, § V, 9-21-1990) 
Sec. 18-33. - Electronic and visual use restrictions. 
Notwithstanding any other section of this article, no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this article in such a manner as to: 
(1)	Create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft; 
(2)	Make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others; 
(3)	Result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport; 
(4)	Impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport; or 
(5)	Otherwise in any way create a hazard or endanger the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport. 
(Ord. No. 56, § VI, 9-21-1990) 
Sec. 18-34. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)	Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other changes or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nothing contained in this article shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives and is diligently prosecuted. 
(b)	Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the building official to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport hazards. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the county commission. 
(Ord. No. 56, § VII, 9-21-1990) 
Sec. 18-35. - Permits. 
(a)	Future uses. No material change shall be made in the use of land and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted, or otherwise established in any zone created by this article unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. However, a permit for a tree or structure of less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground shall not be required in the horizontal and conical zones or in any approach and transitional zones beyond a horizontal distance of 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for the respective zone. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired with sufficient particulars to determine whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations prescribed in this article. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. 
(b)	Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives or any amendments to this article or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(c)	Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the building official determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
(d)	Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure or permit the growth of any tree or use his property not in accordance with this article may apply to the board of adjustments and appeals for a variance from this article.

(e)	Right to be heard. The parties in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing. 
(f)	Order. If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the property in question meets one or more of the standards enumerated in subsection (b) so as to constitute a public nuisance, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order which does one of the following: 
(1)	If the repair of the said property can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to its present value, the order shall require the owner, within a specified time, to repair such property so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to effect a closing of any structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
(2)	If the repair of the said property in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value thereof, the order shall require the owner, within a specified time, to demolish and remove the noncompliant dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
For purposes of this section, in cases in which the nuisance complained of is a dwelling, building, or structure of any kind, the court shall make its determination of 'reasonable cost in relation to the present value' without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, the costs of the preparation necessary to repair a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. tit. 43, ch. 39A, qualified building contractors with a current business license to do work in Upson County, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations 
(g)	Remedies of public officer in the event of noncompliance with order. 
(1)	The order entered under subsection (f) shall further provide that, if the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, demolish, or close the property within the specified time, the public officer may cause such property to be repaired, demolished, or closed, whichever the order required upon approval of the board of commissioners. The public officer is also authorized to file a motion for attachment for contempt against the owner with the court which issued the order as an alternate or additional remedy. 
(2)	If the public officer chooses to have the work done as ordered, he or she shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful. Removal of this notice shall constitute a crime. 
(3)	It shall be unlawful for any person to remove any such posted notice, and anyone who does shall upon conviction be punished as provided by ordinance. The code enforcement officer shall have the authority to cite persons for such unlawful removal. 
(h)	Salvage. If the public officer has a structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. Neither the public officer nor Upson County shall have any liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
(i)	Lien for costs. The order shall provide that the amount of all costs associated with the abatement action shall be a lien against the real property upon which such costs was incurred. Such costs shall include but not be limited to the cost of demolition, reasonable attorneys' fees and all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, restoration to grade of the real property should it be demolished, and title examination costs. The order should recite the amount of costs incurred by the county as of the date of the order. Upon preparing a final statement of costs, the public officer shall prepare a "lien for costs of abatement" detailing any and all such costs. Such lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition, in the office of the clerk of superior court, and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under section 23-8. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien for costs of abatement on the general execution docket. Such lien should cross-reference the order and include the original caption and case number from the nuisance abatement action. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid in full. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the tax commissioner. 
(j)	Enforcement of lien. It shall be the duty of the tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property; however, the tax commissioner shall be authorized to bill the amount of the lien as it comes due separately from the annual ad valorem tax bill in order to ensure prompt notice of the amount of the lien and so as to not interfere with the regular billing cycle of the annual ad valorem taxes. The tax commissioner shall have the full authority to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the general fund of the county. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
(k)	Waiver of lien. The board of commissioners may waive and release any such lien imposed on property of the owner for costs incurred by the county up to the time of the entry of the order and any additional costs incurred subsequent thereto in attempting to bring the property into compliance by entering into a contract with the owner in which the owner agrees to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrates the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
(l)	Appellate procedure. Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a property shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
(m)	Alternate remedies. Nothing in this section shall be construed as to limit or impair the authority of public officers or other county employees under existing and future ordinances to issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and to seek to enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this chapter. The issuance of a citation for a violation of any such codes shall not be required as a prerequisite to issuing a complaint in rem under this section.

(Ord. No. 213, § III, 4-27-2010) 
Sec. 38-29. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)	General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of sections 38-29(b) and 38-29(c). of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
(b)	Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)	Best management practices as set forth in sections 38-29(b) and 38-29(c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)	A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)	Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)	The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
(5)	The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (c)(16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)	The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)	Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)	Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)	Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
(4)	Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)	The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)	Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)	Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)	Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)	To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)	Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)	Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)	Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)	Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)	Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 38-29(b)(2) of this article; 
(15)	Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)	There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(d)	Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in sections 38-29(b) and 38-29(c) of this article. 
(e)	The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 213, § IV, 4-27-2010) 
Sec. 38-30. - Application/permit process. 
(a)	General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, the ordinance from which this article is derived, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)	Application requirements. 
(1)	No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of Upson County without first obtaining a permit from the Upson County Zoning Administrator to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)	The application for a permit shall be submitted to the Upson County Zoning Administrator and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 38-30(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of sections 38-29(b) and 38-29(c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
(3)	In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(4)	Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by sections 38-29(c)(15) and 38-29(c)(16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 38-30(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(5)	If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(6)	The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)	Plan requirements. 
(1)	Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in sections 38-29(b) and 38-29(c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and State laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the Stakeholder Advisory Board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(2)	Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
(d)	Permits. 
(1)	Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)	No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 38-29(c)(15) and 38-29(c)(16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per section 38-30(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)	Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of the ordinance from which this article is derived, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(4)	If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(5)	The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(6)	The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
(Ord. No. 213, § V, 4-27-2010) 
Sec. 38-31. - Inspection and enforcement. 
(a)	The Upson County Zoning Administrator will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
(b)	The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975.

(Ord. No. 210, art. 1, § A, 9-22-2009) 
Sec. 42-22. - Findings of fact. 
(a)	The flood hazard areas of Upson County, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)	These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 210, art. 1, § B, 9-22-2009) 
Sec. 42-23. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;

(10)	Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not compliant with the provisions of this article, shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
(Ord. No. 210, art. 4, § A, 9-22-2009) 
Sec. 42-62. - Specific standards. 
In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(1)	New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should said foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of division 4, section 42-61(4), "elevated buildings." 
a.	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
(2)	Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in division 3, section 52-53(6). 
(3)	Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.	All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: 
1.	Individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
b.	Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
1.	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
2.	The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
c.	All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. section 42-61(6) above.) 
d.	All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.	Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. 
2.	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions), or 
3.	The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of division 4, section 42-62(3)c., above. 
(4)	Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in division 2, section 42-32, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.	Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
b.	Only if section 42-62(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4. 
(Ord. No. 210, art. 4, § B, 9-22-2009) 
Sec. 42-63. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in division 2, section 42-32, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
(1)	When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 42-32, then the administrative officer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 4. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions ((2) and (3)) shall apply; 
(2)	No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)	In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed.) Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of division 4, section 42-61(4) "elevated buildings." 
a.	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.

(b)	The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the administrative officer in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)	Any person aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Upson County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § article. 
(d)	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)	Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this division are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)	In reviewing such requests, the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(h)	Conditions for variances: 
(1)	A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.	A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)	The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)	The administrative officer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(i)	Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after May 17, 1989, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after May 17, 1989, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after May 17, 1989.

(1)	Built on a single chassis; 
(2)	Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(3)	Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and 
(4)	Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the county's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
