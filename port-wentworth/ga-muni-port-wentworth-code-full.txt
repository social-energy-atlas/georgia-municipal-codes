PREFACE 
This Code is a codification of the ordinances of Port Wentworth of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included therein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
This 2008 republication includes all amendatory legislation through Ord. No. 06-17, adopted June 22, 2006, and was accomplished under the supervision of Diana Ossi, Editor. 
The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations setting forth their location within the Code volume is included at the back of this volume. The source of each section is indicated by the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Table also appearing in the back of the volume, any ordinance included herein can be readily found in the Code. 
Numbering System 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the second section of Chapter 3 is 3-2. 
Under this system each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 4-4 and 4-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2, 4-4.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13 it will be designated as Chapter 12.1. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Code with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in Section 4 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
The 1978 publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of George R. Langford, President and Roger D. Merriam, Editor of Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.

Sec. 2-53. - Statement of purpose. 
The purpose of this article, to be known as "The Fiscal Control Ordinance of the City of Port Wentworth," is to provide for a system of financial administration, accounting, fiscal and budgetary control which conforms to generally accepted accounting practices.

Sec. 2-54. - Definitions. 
Accrual basis.

Appropriation balance. Unencumbered balance of appropriation or allotment, and unexpended balance of appropriation or allotment.

Audit. The examination of records, documents, reports, systems or internal control, accounting and financial procedures, and other evidence for one (1) or more of the following purposes:

(b)	To determine the propriety, legality, and mathematical accuracy of a government unit's financial transactions; 
(c)	To ascertain whether all financial transactions have been properly recorded; and 
(d)	To ascertain the stewardship of public officials who handle and are responsible for the financial resources of a governmental unit.

Contingent account. An appropriation to provide for unforeseen expenditures. 
Current surplus. The excess of the current assets of a fund over its current liabilities and reserves. 
Debit and credit. Terms commonly used to indicate the manner in which a transaction is to be recorded. Every entry on the left side of the ledger sheet is called a "debit." Every entry on the right side of the ledger sheet is called a "credit." We debit in order to record: 
(1)	An increase in expenditure or a decrease in revenue; 
(2)	A decrease in an asset; 
(3)	An increase in a liability. 
Debt service. The amount of money necessary annually to pay the interest on the outstanding debt and the principal of maturing bonded debt not payable from a sinking fund and to provide a fund for the redemption of bonds payable from a sinking fund. 
Delinquent taxes. Taxes remaining unpaid on and after the date on which a penalty for nonpayment is attached.

Liabilities. Liabilities are debts owed. 
Millage. A term used to express the property tax rate and derived from the term "mill," which is one-tenth of a cent ($0.001). Thus, ten (10) mills equal one cent ($0.01) or one (1) per cent. 
0.001 = 1 mill or 1/10 cent  0.010 = 10 mills or 1 cent = 1%  0.100 = 100 mills or 10 cents = 10%

(Ord. No. 01-03, 3-8-01) 
Sec. 2-70. - Investment policies and procedures. 
(1)	Scope. This investment policy applies to activities of the City of Port Wentworth with regards to investing the financial assets of its funds (the city does not manage its own pension trust fund). These funds are accounted for in the city's annual financial report and include: 
•	General Fund 
•	Special Revenue Funds 
•	Capital Projects Funds 
•	Propriety Funds 
•	Other funds which may be created from time to time 
(2)	Objectives. The City of Port Wentworth's investment objectives in order of priority are: 
(a)	Safety of principal. Each investment transaction will be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. The objective will be to mitigate credit risk and interest rate risk. The City of Port Wentworth will minimize credit risk, the risk of loss due to the failure of the security issuer or backer, by: 
1.	Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in subsection (6) of this investment policy; and 
2.	Diversifying the investment portfolio so that the losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the remainder of the portfolio. 
Interest rate risk, the risk that the market value of securities in the portfolio will decrease due to changes in market interest rates, will be minimized by: 
1.	Structuring the investment portfolio so that securities mature to meet cash requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the need to sell securities prior to maturity; and 
2.	Investing operating funds primarily in shorter-term securities, money market mutual funds, or similar investment pools and limiting the average maturity of the portfolio in accordance with this policy. 
(b)	Maintenance of adequate liquidity. The investment portfolio must be structured in such a manner that it provides sufficient liquidity to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. This is accomplished by structuring the portfolio so that securities mature concurrent with cash needs to meet anticipated demands. 
(c)	Return on investment. The city seeks to attain market rates of return on its investments consistent with constraints imposed by its safety objectives, cash flow considerations and state laws that restrict the placement of certain public funds. Return on investment is of secondary importance compared to the safety and liquidity objectives described above. The core of investment is limited to relatively low risk securities in anticipation of earning a fair return relative to the risk being assumed. Securities shall generally be held until maturity with the following exceptions: 
•	A security with declining credit may be sold early to minimize loss of principal. 
•	A security swap would improve the quality, yield, or target duration in the portfolio. 
•	Liquidity needs of the portfolio require that the security be sold. 
(d)	Legality. The City of Port Wentworth's funds will be invested in compliance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 36-83-4 and in accordance with these policies and written administrative procedures. 
(3)	Standards of care. 
(a)	Prudence. The standard of prudence to be used by investment officials shall be the "prudent person" standard and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. Investment officers acting in accordance with written procedures and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in a timely fashion and the liquidity and the sale of securities are carried out in accordance with the terms of this policy. 
The "prudent person" standard states that, "Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived." 
(b)	Ethics and conflicts of interest. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution and management of the investment program, or that could impair their ability to make impartial decisions. Employees and investment officials shall disclose any material interests in financial institutions with which they conduct business. They shall further disclose any personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the investment portfolio. Employees and officers shall refrain from undertaking personal investment transactions with the same individual with whom business is conducted on behalf of the City of Port Wentworth. 
(c)	Delegation of authority. The Port Wentworth City Council shall establish the overall investment policies, the management and implementation of which is delegated to the assistant city administrator, who shall establish procedures for the operation of the investment program. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and the procedures established by the assistant city administrator. The assistant city administrator shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials. 
(4)	Authorized financial institutions, depositories, and broker/dealers. It is the policy of the City of Port Wentworth to purchase securities only from those broker-dealers and banks that are included on the city's bid list as approved by the assistant city administrator. The approved list will be developed in accordance with these investment policies. 
Repurchase agreements will be conducted only with those banks and broker-dealers who have executed a master repurchase agreement with the city. All repurchase agreements must be in written form using the Public Securities Association master repurchase agreement as a guide. Annex I of the guide shall materially conform to the recommendations by the Government Finance Officers Association. Agreements not substantially conforming to the master [repurchase agreement] and Annex I are not acceptable. 
Broker/dealers will be required to sign a broker-dealer questionnaire certification. 
(5)	Safekeeping and custody. 
(a)	Delivery vs. payment. All trades of marketable securities will be executed by delivery vs. payment (DVP) to ensure that securities are deposited in an eligible financial institution prior to the release of funds. 
(b)	Safekeeping. Securities will be held by an independent third-party custodian selected by the entity as evidenced by safekeeping receipts in the City of Port Wentworth's name. 
(c)	Internal controls. The assistant city administrator is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that the assets of the City of Port Wentworth are protected from loss, theft or misuse. The internal controls shall address the following points: 
1.	Control of collusion. Collusion is a situation where two (2) or more employees are working in conjunction to defraud their employer. 
2.	Separation of functions. By separating key functions and having different people perform each function, each person can perform a "check and balance" review of the other people in the same area. 
3.	Separation of transaction authority from accounting and recordkeeping. By separating the person who authorizes or performs the transaction from the people who record or otherwise account for the transaction, a good separation of duties is achieved. 
4.	Custodial safekeeping. Securities purchased from any bank or dealer, including appropriate collateral, should be placed into a third party bank for custodial safekeeping. 
5.	Avoidance of bearer-form securities. Bearer-form securities are much easier to convert to personal use than securities that are registered in the name of the City of Port Wentworth. 
6.	Avoidance of physical delivery securities. Book entry securities are much easier to transfer and account for since actual delivery is never taken. Physical delivery securities must be properly safeguarded as are any valuable documents. The potential of fraud and loss increases with physical delivery securities. 
7.	Clear delegation of authority to subordinate staff members. Subordinate staff members must have a clear understanding of their authority and responsibilities to avoid any improper actions. Clear delegation of authority also preserves the internal control structure that is built around the various staff positions and their respective responsibilities. 
8.	Written confirmation of telephone transactions for investments and wire transfers. Due to the potential for errors and improprieties arising from telephone transactions, all telephone transactions should be supported by written communications and approved by the appropriate person. 
9.	Documentation of transactions and strategies. 
10.	Development of a wire transfer agreement with the city's lead bank. This agreement should outline the various controls and security provisions for making and receiving wire transfers. 
(6)	Suitable and authorized investments. The following investments will be permitted by this policy as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 36-83-4: 
•	Obligations of the State of Georgia or of other states. 
•	U.S. Treasury obligations (bills, notes and bonds). 
•	Obligations fully insured or guaranteed by the United States government or a United States government agency. 
•	Obligations of the following United States government agencies: 
-	Federal Farm Credit Banks (FFCB) 
-	Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) 
-	Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) or its banks 
-	Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) 
-	Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) participation certificates or debentures 
-	Student Loan Marketing Association 
•	Repurchase agreements backed by the United States government or a government agency. 
•	The local government investment pool. 
•	Obligations of other political subdivisions of the State of Georgia. 
•	Time deposits and savings deposits of banks organized under the laws of Georgia or the United States government and operating in Georgia. 
-	Savings accounts 
-	Money market accounts 
-	Certificates of deposits (nonnegotiable type) 
(7)	Investment parameters. 
(a)	Diversification. The investments shall be diversified by: 
1.	Limiting investments to avoid over concentration in securities from a specific issuer or business sector (excluding U.S. Treasury securities); 
2.	Limiting investment in securities that have higher credit risks; 
3.	Investing in securities with varying maturities; and 
4.	Continuously investing a portion of the portfolio in readily available funds such as local government investment pools (LGIPs), money market funds or overnight repurchase agreements to ensure that appropriate liquidity is maintained in order to meet ongoing obligations. 
5.	No more than forty (40) per cent of the entire invested portfolio may be placed with any one (1) bank or security dealer. 
(b)	Maximum maturities. The longer the maturity of a particular investment, the greater its susceptibility to market price and credit losses. The city seeks to eliminate such risk by maintaining conservative maturities that are within guidelines recommended by the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA). These guidelines generally recommend avoiding securities with maturities beyond five (5) years unless the investment is matched and held to a specific maturity. Investment maturities shall be scheduled to coincide with projected cash flow needs, taking into consideration large routine expenditures (i.e. payroll and bond payments) as well as anticipated revenues (i.e. property tax collections). 
(c)	Active secondary markets. Although many securities are acceptable for investing using the legal authorized list, some are not very desirable from a liquidity standpoint. Accordingly, although investments may be on the authorized list, only those securities with an active secondary market may be purchased from that list. 
(8)	Policy considerations. 
(a)	Exemption. Any investment currently held that does not meet the guidelines of this policy shall be exempted from the requirements of this policy. At maturity or liquidation, such monies shall be reinvested only as provided by this policy. 
(b)	Amendments. This policy shall be reviewed on an annual basis. Any changes must be approved by the assistant city administrator and the city council. 
(9)	Approval of investment policy. The investment policy shall be formally approved and adopted by the Port Wentworth City Council and reviewed annually. 
(Ord. No. 05-14, § 1(I—IX), 9-22-05) 
Sec. 2-71. - Homestead exemption. 
(1)	The mayor and council hereby increase the homestead exemption from ad valorem real property taxes levied by the City of Port Wentworth to forty thousand dollars ($40,000.00), notwithstanding the existence of any law or ordinance establishing a homestead exemption from municipal ad valorem taxes in a lesser amount. This exemption is in lieu of, and not in addition to, any other homestead exemption from municipal taxation. 
(2)	"Homestead" means the real property owned by and in possession of the applicant on January 1 of the taxable year and upon which the applicant resides including, but not limited to, the land immediately surrounding the residence to which the applicant has a right of possession under a bona fide claim of ownership. The term "homestead" includes the following qualifications: 
(a)	The actual permanent place of residence of an individual who is the applicant and which constitutes the home of the family; 
(b)	Where the person who is the applicant holds the bona fide fee title (although subject to mortgage or debt deed), an estate for life, or under any bona fide contract of purchase providing for the conveyance of title to the applicant upon performance of the contract; 
(c)	Where the building is occupied primarily as a dwelling; 
(d)	Where the children of deceased or incapacitated parents occupy the homestead of their parents and one (1) of the children stands in the relation of applicant. This subparagraph shall apply whether or not the estate is distributed; 
(e)	Where a husband or wife occupies a dwelling and the title of the homestead is in the name of the wife; 
(f)	In the event a dwelling house which is classed as a homestead is destroyed by fire, flood, storm, or other unavoidable accident or is demolished or repaired so that the owner is compelled to reside temporarily in another place, the dwelling house shall continue to be classed as a homestead for a period of one (1) year after the occurrence; 
(g)	In the event an individual who is the applicant owns two (2) or more dwelling houses, he shall be allowed the exemption granted by law on only one (1) of the houses. Only one (1) homestead shall be allowed to one (1) immediate family group; 
(h)	Where property is owned and occupied jointly by two (2) or more individuals all of whom occupy the property as a home and if the property is otherwise entitled to a homestead exemption, the homestead may be claimed in the names of the joint owners residing in the home. Where the property on which a homestead exemption is claimed is jointly owned by the occupant and others, the occupant or occupants shall be entitled to claim the full amount of the homestead exemption; 
(i)	The permanent place of residence of an individual in the armed forces. Any such residence shall be construed to be actually occupied as the place of abode of such individual when the family of the individual resides in the residence or when the family is forced to live elsewhere because of the individual's service in the armed forces; 
(j)	Absence of an individual from his residence because of duty in the armed forces shall not be considered as a waiver upon the part of the individual in applying for a homestead exemption. Any member of the immediate family of the individual or a friend of the individual may notify the tax receiver or the tax commissioner of the individual's absence. Upon receipt of this notice, the tax receiver or tax commissioner shall grant the homestead exemption to the individual who is absent in the armed forces; 
(k)	The homestead exempted must be actually occupied as the permanent residence and place of abode by the applicant awarded the exemption, and the homestead shall be the legal residence and domicile of the applicant for all purposes whatever; 
(l)	In all counties having a population of not less than nineteen thousand two hundred (19,200) nor more than nineteen thousand seven hundred fifty (19,750), according to the United States decennial census of 2000 or any future such census, where the person who is the applicant holds real property subject to a written lease; the applicant has held the property subject to such a lease for not less than three (3) years prior to the year for which application is made; and the applicant is the owner of all improvements located on the real property; 
(m)	The deed reflecting the actual ownership of the property for which the applicant seeks to receive a homestead exemption must be recorded in the deed records of the county prior to the filing of the application for the homestead exemption; and 
(n)	Absence of an individual from such individual's residence because of health reasons shall not in and of itself be considered as a waiver upon the part of the individual in applying for a homestead exemption if all other qualifications are otherwise met. Any member of the immediate family of the individual or a friend of the individual may notify the tax receiver or the tax commissioner of the individual's absence. Upon receipt of this notice, the tax receiver or tax commissioner shall grant the homestead exemption to the individual who is absent for health reasons. 
(3)	The owner requesting a homestead exemption shall file an application with the city for determination of whether the owner is entitled to such exemption. The city shall provide the application forms. The exemption shall be automatically renewed from year to year as long as the owner of the property occupies the residence as a homestead. This exemption shall be in addition to other exemptions granted by the state or county. This ordinance may be amended at any time following the procedures for such amendment. 
(4)	The exemption established herein shall apply only to municipal ad valorem taxes.

DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 7-14. - Statutory authorization. 
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and council of the City of Port Wentworth, Georgia does ordain that the following provisions will constitute its regulations for flood hazard protection. 
(Ord. No. 13-17, § 1, 8-22-13) 
Sec. 7-15. - Findings of fact. 
(a)	The flood hazard areas of the City of Port Wentworth are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)	These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 13-17, § 1, 8-22-13) 
Sec. 7-16. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
(5)	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(Ord. No. 13-17, § 1, 8-22-13) 
Sec. 7-17. - Objectives. 
The objectives of this article are: 
(1)	To protect human life and health; 
(2)	To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)	To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, 
(4)	To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)	To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)	To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
(7)	To insure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term does not, however, include: 
(1)	Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the structure commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. 
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(b)	The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building inspector in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)	Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the state inventory of historic places without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section, except for the subsections (G)(1) and (4) below and provided the proposed reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration will not result in the structure losing its historical designation. 
(d)	Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(e)	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(f)	In reviewing such requests, the zoning board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, all standards specified in this and other sections of this article, and: 
(1)	The danger that the materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)	The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)	The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)	The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)	The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility; 
(6)	The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)	The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)	The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)	The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)	The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and other effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(11)	The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(g)	Conditions for variances: 
(1)	A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.	A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
b.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; 
c.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)	The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)	The clerk of council shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(h)	Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the zoning board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

DIVISION 2. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE PROHIBITION 

Sec. 7-72. - General provisions. 
(a)	Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that: 
(1)	Discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
(2)	These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping, and improper connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. 
(3)	These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. 
(4)	The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values, and other uses of lands and waters. 
(5)	These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping, and discharges into the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
(6)	Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations, and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
Therefore, the City of Port Wentworth adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping, and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment. 
(b)	Purpose. The purpose of this article is to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Port Wentworth through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent practicable. The objectives of this article are: 
(1)	To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) by stormwater discharges by any user; 
(2)	To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the MS4; and 
(3)	To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection; surveillance and monitoring; and enforcement procedures as necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
(c)	Applicability. This article shall apply to all non-stormwater discharges entering the storm drain system generated on any developed or undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by the City of Port Wentworth under section 7-79(d) of this article. 
(Ord. No. 09-20, Div. 7(7.66), 10-22-09) 
Sec. 7-73. - Discharge prohibitions. 
(a)	Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the MS4 or watercourses any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. 
The commencement, conduct, or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows: 
(1)	The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this article: water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated—typically less than one (1) PPM chlorine), fire fighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants. 
(2)	Discharges specified in writing by the City of Port Wentworth as being necessary to protect public health and safety. 
(3)	Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the City of Port Wentworth twenty-four (24) hours prior to the time of the test followed by written notice within ten (10) days. 
(4)	Any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the City of Port Wentworth prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
(5)	Any stormwater discharge regulated under an NPDES stormwater discharge permit for industrial activities provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the City of Port Wentworth prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.

DIVISION 3. - POST CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER RUNOFF 

Sec. 7-79. - General provisions. 
(a)	Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that: 
(1)	Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads, and increase flooding, channel erosion, and pollutant transport and deposition in rivers and streams; 
(2)	Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads, and, consequently, alter water levels and fluctuations and increase pollutant transport and deposition in wetlands; 
(3)	Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads, and alter salinity concentrations and fluctuations and increase productivity and pollutant transport and deposition in estuaries; 
(4)	Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads, and increase bacteria transport and deposition in near coastal waters, which leads to beach contamination and closure and poses a serious threat to human health; 
(5)	Land development activities alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds, increasing stormwater runoff rates and volumes, and, consequently, decreasing the amount of rainfall that is available to recharge shallow groundwater aquifers; 
(6)	The negative impacts of land development activities on these important local aquatic resources can adversely affect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public; 
(7)	The negative impacts of land development can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads on development and redevelopment sites; 
(8)	Communities within the coastal nonpoint source management area are required to comply with specific state and federal regulations that require the adverse impacts of increased stormwater runoff rates, volumes, and pollutant loads to be controlled and minimized. 
Therefore, the City of Port Wentworth has determined that it is in the public interest to control and minimize the adverse impacts of land development activities and has established this set of stormwater management provisions to regulate post-construction stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads on development and redevelopment sites. 
(b)	Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect and maintain the integrity of local aquatic resources, and, consequently, the health, safety, and welfare of the general public, by establishing minimum stormwater management provisions that control and minimize the adverse impacts of land development activities. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)	Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of local aquatic resources; 
(2)	Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria that will reduce flooding, channel erosion, and pollutant transport and deposition in local aquatic resources; 
(3)	Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria that will help preserve existing hydrologic conditions and development and redevelopment sites; 
(4)	Establish design criteria for structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria; 
(5)	Encourage the use of better site planning, better site design and low impact development practices, such as those found in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM) and the coastal stormwater supplement (CSS) to the maximum extent practical at development and redevelopment sites to mimic the pre-development hydrologic function of the site by encouraging natural processes that detain and filter stormwater runoff pollutants; 
(6)	Establish provisions for the long-term upkeep and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed and pose a minimal threat to public safety; 
(7)	Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans and for the inspection of approved land development projects; 
(8)	Identify and protect existing natural systems from potential adverse impacts resulting from land development activities and post construction stormwater runoff; and 
(9)	Balance development demands and natural resource protection through the implementation of low impact planning, design and development strategies. 
(c)	Applicability. This article shall be applicable to all land development activities, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection (d) below. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment activity within City of Port Wentworth that meets one (1) or more of the following criteria: 
(1)	New development that involves the creation of (five thousand (5,000) square feet or more) of impervious cover or that involves other land development activities of (one (1) acre or more); 
(2)	Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition, or replacement of (five thousand (5,000) square feet or more) of impervious cover or that involves other land development activities of (one (1) acre or more); 
(3)	Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the City of Port Wentworth to be a hotspot land use; or, 
(4)	Development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate, and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules; 
(5)	For development of a project in phases, a stormwater master plan is required to conceptually indicate how the minimum requirements of this article will be met. This does not preclude the requirements of a SWMP for each phase as it is being developed. The master plan of multi-phased developments shall consolidate stormwater management facilities to as much as practical. 
(d)	Exempt activities. The following activities are exempt from this article: 
(1)	Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project that is otherwise subject to this article; 
(2)	Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
(3)	Projects that are exclusively for agricultural or silvicultural activities within areas zoned for these agricultural and silvicultural use; 
(4)	Maintenance and repairs of any stormwater facility deemed necessary by the director or their designee; 
(5)	Any part of a land development project that was approved by the director or their designee prior to the adoption of this article; and, 
(6)	Redevelopment that constitutes the replacement of the original square footage of impervious cover and original acreage of other land development activity when the original development is wholly or partially lost due to natural disaster or other acts of God occurring after October 22, 2009. 
(e)	Stormwater management manual. The City of Port Wentworth will utilize the standards, criteria, and information presented in the latest edition of the coastal stormwater supplement (CSS), the GSMM, local design and construction standards, and any relevant local addenda, for the proper implementation of this article. These references may be updated and expanded periodically, based on improvements in science, engineering, monitoring, and local experience. 
(f)	Development of local stormwater design criteria. The City of Port Wentworth may furnish additional policy, criteria, and information including specifications and standards, for the proper implementation of the requirements of this article. This information will serve to supplement and/or clarify information set forth in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and Coastal Stormwater Supplement. 
This information may include a list of acceptable stormwater treatment practices, including the specific design criteria and operation and maintenance requirements for each stormwater practice. This information may be updated and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the City of Port Wentworth, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring and local maintenance experience. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed and constructed in accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards during the design and permitting phase of a land development project.

(a)	Variances for providing stormwater management every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required by this article, unless a written request is filed for a variance from this requirement. Requests for variances from the stormwater management plan requirements shall be submitted to the City of Port Wentworth for approval. A written request for a variance shall be required and shall state the specific variance sought and the reasons, with supporting data, a variance should be granted. The request shall include all information necessary to evaluate the proposed variance. The director will conduct a review of the request for a variance within ten (10) working days of receiving the request. 
The minimum requirements for stormwater management may be waived in whole or in part upon written request of the applicant, provided that at least one (1) of the following conditions apply or the applicant presents sufficient engineering data and analysis to support their request for a variance as determined by the local jurisdiction: 
(1)	It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this article. 
(2)	Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater management plan that has been approved by the director and local ordinance (or some other legally enforceable document) that requires the implementation of the plan. 
(3)	Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility. The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the stormwater practice. 
(4)	The director finds that meeting the minimum on-site management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical characteristics of a site. 
(5)	Non-structural practices will be used on the site that reduce: 1) the generation of stormwater from the site; 2) the size and cost of stormwater storage; and 3) the pollutants generated at the site. These non-structural practices shall be explained in detail in the local or state design manual and the amount of credit available for using such practices shall be determined by the City of Port Wentworth. 
(b)	Conditions of variance. In instances where one (1) of the conditions above applies, the City of Port Wentworth may grant a variance from strict compliance with these stormwater management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a variance, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the variance will not result in the following impacts to downstream waterways: 
(1)	Increase in rate, volume, or concentration of runoff to the existing downstream storm sewer system; 
(2)	Impact base flood elevation upstream or downstream; 
(3)	Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, and property; 
(4)	Have a negative impact on any wetland, watercourse, or water body; 
(5)	Contribute to degradation of water quality; 
(6)	Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures; 
(7)	Degradation of biological functions or habitat; or 
(8)	Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion or siltation. 
(c)	Mitigation requirements for variances. Where compliance with minimum requirements for stormwater management is waived and a variance is issued, the applicant will satisfy the minimum requirements by meeting one (1) of the mitigation measures selected by the director. Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)	The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. These lands should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat. 
(2)	The creation of a stormwater management facility or other drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public or private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed in accordance with the purposes and standards of this article. 
(3)	Monetary contributions (fee-in-lieu) to fund stormwater management activities such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland delineation studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and macroinvertebrates, stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species studies, hydrologic studies, and monitoring of stormwater management practices, etc.). 
(d)	Fee in lieu of stormwater management practices. Where the City of Port Wentworth issues a variances from all or part of the minimum stormwater management requirements, or where the variance is based on the provision of adequate stormwater facilities provided downstream of the proposed development, the applicant may be required to pay a fee in an amount as determined by the city. 
When an applicant obtains a waiver of the required stormwater management, the monetary contribution required shall be in accordance with a fee schedule (unless the developer and the City of Port Wentworth agree on a greater alternate contribution) established by the City of Port Wentworth Council. All of the monetary contributions shall be credited to an appropriate capital improvements program project, and shall be made by the developer prior to the issuance of any development permits. 
(e)	Dedication of land. In lieu of a monetary contribution, an applicant may obtain a variance from the required stormwater management by entering into an agreement with the City of Port Wentworth for the granting of an easement or the dedication of land by the applicant, to be used for the construction of an off-site stormwater management facility. The agreement shall be entered into by the applicant and the City of Port Wentworth prior to the recording of plats or, if no record plat is required, prior to the issuance of the development permits. 
(Ord. No. 09-20, Div. 8(7.75), 10-22-09) 
Sec. 7-82. - Post-construction stormwater management criteria. 
All development and redevelopment sites shall utilize structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices to control and minimize the increased stormwater runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads caused by land development in accordance with the criteria presented below. Better site planning and design techniques and low impact development practices and nonstructural stormwater controls should be used to the maximum extent practical to reduce runoff rates, velocities, volumes, and pollutant loads and the site's impact on the watershed. Such techniques and practices include, but are not limited to, conservation and/or restoration of natural areas, such as forests, wetlands, and riparian buffers, minimization and/or disconnection of impervious surfaces, and small-scale distributed stormwater management practices, such as rain gardens, pervious pavement, and stormwater planters, that intercept and treat or otherwise manage stormwater runoff close to its source. 
For structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices not included in the CSS or GSMM, or for which pollutant removal and runoff reduction rates have not been provided, the effectiveness of the structural or nonstructural stormwater management practice must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the director before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the post-construction stormwater management criteria, the director may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or due to increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the development or redevelopment site in question. 
The following criteria shall apply to all land development activities and stormwater management design plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article: 
(a)	Natural resources inventory. A graphic illustration of the natural resources at the development or redevelopment site, as they exist prior to the start of land development activities, shall be prepared during the site planning process. The natural resources inventory shall include, at a minimum: existing topography; natural drainage features; perennial and intermittent streams; wetlands; riparian buffers; floodplains; steep slopes; soil types; groundwater recharge areas; areas with high groundwater; conservation areas; stands of trees and/or other vegetation; and areas with significant habitat value. Protection, conservation and/or restoration of a site's natural resources through the use of better site planning techniques may, at the discretion of the director, allow for a reduction in stormwater runoff volume as a means of complying with the post-construction stormwater management criteria outlined in subsections 7-82(b) through (g). The better site planning techniques that qualify for this credit, and the procedures for calculating the runoff reduction provided by these nonstructural stormwater management practices, is provided in the latest edition of the coastal stormwater supplement. 
(b)	Runoff reduction. Some portion of the stormwater runoff generated on a development or redevelopment site shall be captured and retained, reused, or otherwise reduced in order to preserve and/or replicate pre-development site hydrology, recharge shallow groundwater aquifers with treated stormwater runoff, promote baseflow to on-site and downstream aquatic resources, and minimize the water quality impacts of land development. A stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
(1)	It is designed to capture and retain, reuse, or otherwise reduce the prescribed runoff reduction volume from the site, as defined in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and the local stormwater design manual; 
(2)	Appropriate structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices that provide for the interception, evaporation, transpiration, passive infiltration, active (engineered) infiltration, extended filtration, and capture and reuse of stormwater runoff have been selected, designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the standards, criteria, and information presented in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and the local stormwater design manual; and, 
(3)	Stormwater runoff from any development or redevelopment site that is designated by the director or in the local stormwater management criteria as a stormwater hotspot is not managed through the use of structural or nonstructural stormwater management practices that provide for passive or active (engineered) infiltration of stormwater runoff, unless adequate pre-treatment is provided, as defined by the City of Port Wentworth. 
Green infrastructure, which includes better site planning and design techniques and low impact development practices as outlined in the GSMM and other approved design references, shall be used to the maximum extent practical during the site planning and design process to capture and retain, reuse, or otherwise reduce the prescribed runoff reduction volume on a development or redevelopment site. 
The director may reduce or waive the runoff reduction requirements on a development or redevelopment site with high groundwater, groundwater recharge areas, tight or contaminated soils, or other site constraints that prevent the use of one (1) or more runoff reduction processes provided appropriate stormwater quality and quantity management activities are undertaken as outlined in this article. When seeking a reduction in or waiver from runoff reduction requirements, the applicant shall demonstrate that structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices that provide for the interception, evaporation, transpiration, passive infiltration, active (engineered) infiltration, extended filtration, and capture and reuse of stormwater runoff have been used to the maximum extent practical and that no additional runoff reduction can be provided on the site. Any of the prescribed runoff reduction volume that is not captured and retained, reused, or otherwise reduced on the site, shall be captured and treated in an appropriate structural stormwater management practice that has been selected, designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the standards, criteria, and information presented in the latest edition of the GSMM, the CSS and any local stormwater design criteria. 
(c)	Aquatic resource protection.

Sec. 7-94. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
(a)	General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 7-94(b) and (c) of this article. The application measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollutions during all stages of any land-disturbing activity. 
(b)	Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)	Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be requires for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)	A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such discharge results in turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
(3)	Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)	The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
(c)	Minimum protections required. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)	Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)	Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)	Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
(4)	Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)	The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)	Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)	Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)	Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)	To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)	Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)	Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)	Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)	Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)	Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 7-94(b)(2) of this article; 
(15)	Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.	Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.	Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)	There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirements for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.	No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.	The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, proved that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.	Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.	Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(d)	Adoption of provisions which exceed minimum requirements. Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 7-94(b) and (c) of this article. 
(e)	Presumption of violation. The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 04-02, 2-12-04) 
Sec. 7-95. - Application/permit process. 
(a)	General. The property owner, developer or designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans and detailed plans of the local issuing authority that affect the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall review the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and other ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the operator is the only party who may obtain a permit.

(1)	No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Port Wentworth without first obtaining a permit from the local issuing authority to perform such activity. 
(2)	The application for a permit shall be submitted to the local issuing authority and must include the applicant's erosion and sedimentation control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 7-95(c) of this article. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans shall conform to the provisions of subsections 7-94(b) and (c) of this article. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by six (6) copies of the applicant's soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan or that such a visit was not required in accordance with rules and regulations established by the board. 
(3)	A fee, in the amount of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
(4)	In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) one-half (½) of such fees levied shall be permitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) and (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(5)	Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval and disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. A district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan.

The measure of all sound levels shall be made as close to the property line of the receiving land use as is practical.

This provision shall not apply to sounds made by animals kept in animal shelters, veterinary hospitals, commercial pet kennels, or pet shops.

Sec. 19.1-1. - Purpose and findings. 
Be it ordained by the city council of the City of Port Wentworth, Georgia, that: 
(a)	The mayor and council find that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages. However, left completely unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to property values and the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. See, e.g., Scenic America, Billboards and Sign Control available at http://www.scenic.org; Jerry Weitz, Ph.D., AICP, The Public Purpose of Roswell's Sign Ordinance and the Implications of Doing Without It: A Position Paper (December 7, 1999) available at http://roswellgov.com; Street Graphics and the Law, 2004 Revised Edition, Daniel Mandelker, Andrew Bertucci, and William Ewald. The City of Port Wentworth's population has grown substantially since the year 2000 census, most significantly in the area of the city to the north of the intersection of State Route 21 and Crossgate Road, as evidenced by the number of building permits issued for residential construction. At the same time the City of Port Wentworth has experienced significant commercial growth, particularly in the vicinity of the I-95 interchange at State Route 21, in the form of hotels, grocery stores, restaurants, and other businesses that serve the residents of the City of Port Wentworth and the motoring public. With the increase in residential and commercial growth has come a drastic and dramatic increase in the volume of traffic in the city. In order to promote public safety, uniform regulation of signs providing directional, commercial, and noncommercial information to the motoring public is essential. Based on the above facts, cited materials and the studies referenced therein, the city finds that unregulated signs may: 
(1)	Be a safety hazard to drivers and pedestrians; 
(2)	Create unsafe, cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares throughout the city; 
(3)	Hamper economic growth; 
(4)	Lower property values; 
(5)	Adversely impact public investments; 
(6)	Degrade the utility of public safety signs; and 
(7)	Adversely impact the aesthetic quality of the community and surrounding environment. 
(b)	Various and diverse businesses are located within the City of Port Wentworth. The need to advertise products and services must be balanced by the city's obligation to restrict clutter, maintain an aesthetically pleasing environment, protect property values, and enhance public safety. 
(c)	Regulation of the location, size, placement, and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods, services, and facilities in the city without difficulty and confusion, to improve the general attractiveness of the community, to take advantage of the community's natural environment, and to protect property values therein. Such regulation is also necessary to facilitate and aid in the identification and location of businesses in the city in the event of police, fire, or other emergencies and to avoid confusion and delay in response to such emergencies. Accordingly, it is the intention of the city to establish regulations governing the display of signs which will: 
(1)	Balance the rights of individuals to convey their messages through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
(2)	Promote and protect the public health, safety and general welfare; 
(3)	Enhance the economy and the business and industry of the city by promoting the reasonable, orderly and effective display of signs; 
(4)	Restrict signs and lights which increase clutter or which increase the probability of traffic accidents by obstructing vision or distracting motorists; 
(5)	Protect property values by minimizing the possible adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
(6)	Promote signs which are compatible with their surroundings; 
(7)	Afford the business community equal and fair opportunity to advertise and promote its products and services without discrimination; 
(8)	Improve traffic and pedestrian safety; 
(9)	Maintain and enhance the visual environment, and preserve the right of citizens and visitors to enjoy the city's scenic beauty; 
(10)	Promote economic development; 
(11)	Promote the purposes stated in this section by regulating signs based on objective standards, including, but not limited to height and size, and without regard to the content of the sign message; 
(12)	Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations. 
(d)	It is also the purpose of this article to insure proper maintenance, for safety and structural soundness, as well as the appearance and attractiveness of signs. 
(Ord. No. 09-06A, § 1, 5-28-09)

Sec. 21-103. - General provisions. 
(a)	Purpose. Establish additional rules and regulations for the direct or indirect discharge of nondomestic wastewaters into the wastewater systems of the City of Port Wentworth. 
(b)	Enumerated. The purposes of this section are to: 
(1)	Implement the National Pretreatment Standards; 
(2)	Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater system which will pass through or interfere with the treatment processes of city's wastewater treatment plants or which may contaminate sewage sludge; 
(3)	Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater treatment system which will not be compatible with the treatment process and cause city's treatment plant facility(ties) violation under its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit and the applicable rules of all governmental authorities with the jurisdiction over such discharges; 
(4)	Protect health and safety of the personnel and the general public; 
(5)	Authorize the issuance of wastewater discharge permits; provide for monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities; establish administrative review procedures; and require industrial user reporting. 
(Ord. No. 05-03, 4-14-05) 
Sec. 21-104. - Limitations on wastewater discharges. 
(a)	Local limits. The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass through and interference at each of the city facilities. No user shall discharge wastewater in excess of the concentrations set forth below unless alternative limits are granted in a valid permit to discharge industrial wastewater. 

 
In addition, the administrator may limit the discharge of other specific substances not listed above on a case-by-case basis, if the discharge of that substance is shown to interfere with the operation or performance of the receiving POTW or would violate any receiving stream water quality standards upon discharge. All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metals. The administrator may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the concentration-based limitations above. 
(b)	Right of revision. The city reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the wastewater system. 
(c)	Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or pretreatment requirement. The administrator may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or pretreatment requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(d)	Installation of control manhole. When required by the administrator, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole, together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be constructed in accordance with the plans approved by the city engineer, the manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
(e)	State pretreatment standards. State pretreatment standards located in the Rules of Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division, Chapters 391-3-6, are hereby incorporated. 
(f)	National categorical standards. Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the city from imposing on industries national categorical standards, as they are promulgated. The National Categorical Pretreatment Standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405—471, are hereby incorporated. 
(g)	Equivalent concentration or mass limits. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the administrator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
(h)	Alternate limits. When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the administrator shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
(i)	Variances. An industrial user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(j)	Net gross adjustments. An industrial user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.

(1)	The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 
(2)	No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months; 
(3)	The industrial user shall submit a progress report to the administrator no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the established schedule; and 
(4)	In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the administrator. 
(c)	Categorical pretreatment standard deadline reports. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the administrator a report containing the information described in subsection 21-107(a)(2)d.—f. of this article. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the industrial user's long-term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the industrial user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 21-106(a)(6) of this article. 
(d)	Periodic compliance reports. 
(1)	All permitted industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by the administrator, but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are controlled by the industrial users permit. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 21-106(a)(6) of this article. 
(2)	All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(3)	If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the administrator, using the procedures prescribed in subsection 21-107(k) of this article, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(e)	Reports of changed conditions. Each industrial user must notify the administrator of any planned significant changes to the industrial user's operations or system which may alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least ninety (90) days before the change. 
(1)	The administrator may require the industrial user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under subsection 21-106(a)(5) of this article. 
(2)	The administrator may issue a wastewater discharge permit under subsection 21-106(a)(4) of this article or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under subsection 21-106(a)(3) of this article in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(3)	For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increase or decrease of twenty (20) per cent or greater, or the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
(f)	Reports of potential problems. 
(1)	In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the industrial user shall immediately telephone and notify the administrator of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the industrial user. 
(2)	Within five (5) days following such discharge, the industrial user shall, unless waived by the administrator, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
(3)	A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph (1), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(g)	Reports from unpermitted industrial users. All industrial users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the administrator as the administrator may require. 
(h)	Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user must notify the administrator within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the administrator within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user is not required to resample if the administrator monitors at the industrial user's facility at least once a month, or if the administrator samples between the industrial user's initial sampling and when the industrial user receives the results of this sampling. 
(i)	Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(1)	Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection 21-107(e) of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections 21-107(a), (c), and (d) of this article. 
(2)	Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (1), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharges of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)	In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying any additional characteristics of hazardous wastes or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the administrator, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)	In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5)	This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(j)	Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. 
(k)	Sample collection. 
(1)	Except as indicated in paragraph (2), below, the industrial user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the administrator may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four (4) grab samples where the industrial user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with maximum daily limits. 
(2)	Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. Actual sample type requirements shall be included in the wastewater discharge permit. 
(l)	Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(m)	Record keeping. Industrial users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the industrial user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the industrial user or the city, or where the industrial user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the administrator.

P-D-N Planned Development for Nonconforming Use. 
a.	Intent. The purpose of this district shall be to create an area where nonconforming uses exist in other defined districts and are found by the Planning Commission to be likely to continue indefinitely. It is intended to make possible rezoning of such non-conforming uses to P-D-N status as a means for encouraging improvements and controlling further development or redevelopment. 
b.	Initiation and Processing of Planned Development for Rezoning for Certain Nonconforming Uses. Planned development rezoning of nonconforming uses of the kind described above may be initiated by the owner of the property or his authorized agent, or by the governing body, or by the Planning Commission. Such amendments shall be processed as provided generally in Article IX of these Regulations. Except in zones created for residential use, such nonconforming use(s) shall not be changed to another nonconforming use. Changes in uses within a residential zone may occur only upon a review by the Planning Commission and approval of Mayor and Council that the new use(s) does not create any greater negative impacts on the adjacent properties and street network than did the original or previous nonconforming use(s). 
c.	Materials to Accompany Amendment Proposals for Certain Nonconforming Uses. Materials to be submitted shall be provided in Article IX and shall include specifically a plan showing existing structures and uses as located on the premises and as related to structures and uses within fifty (50) feet on immediately adjoining premises not separated from the property by a street or alley, and on premises immediately across streets or alleys to the front, side, or rear of property.

Buffering and Screening Required When Adjoining Property is Residential: Where a surface off-street parking lot and off-street loading and service facility abut a side or rear property line of any lot, or is across a public right-of-way from a lot upon which there exists as a principal use a one-family or two-family dwelling structure permitted in the zoning district in which located, there shall be provided along the lot line, excluding approved driveways, a continuous visual buffer with a minimum height of three (3) feet. The buffer may be a compact evergreen hedge or other type of dense foliage screening, or may be brick, masonry, or other decorative wood wall. No such buffer shall be required along a public lane. 
7.	Other Considerations: In addition to matters covered above, the recommendations and actions shall give due consideration to the relation of the nonconforming use to existing and potential future surrounding development, and shall establish such additional conditions and safeguards as are necessary in the circumstances of the case. Such conditions and safeguards may include, among other things, outdoor storage, operational activity, provisions for seclusion of garbage and trash, and limitations on number of vehicles parked on the premises and the number of employees working on the site for a given time period. 
MPO Master Plan Overlay. The purpose of this district shall be to assure continuity of development with the Port Wentworth Master Plan, as envisioned by the Port Wentworth citizens and City Council. This overlay district shall provide for review of all developments within this district. 
1.	Intent. The intent of this section in establishing the overlay districts is to promote orderly development which implements the urban design concepts of the City of Port Wentworth Master Plan; promote human-scale development and mixed but compatible land uses; promote economic development of the city, promote high quality development; minimize safety hazards to vehicles and pedestrians; and enhance the quality of life for Port Wentworth's citizens. 
1.1	Definition of Districts. These districts shall be collectively referred to as the Master Plan Design Districts, as amended, and defined as specified below. 
A.	Phase 1. The area bordered by Highway 21 to the east, Highway 30 to the south, the western Norfolk Southern rail line to the west, and the Chatham/Effingham County line to the north.

Features include a wide variety of housing types to promote diverse neighborhoods and mixed land uses to allow educational, civic and office buildings, and retail establishments within walking distance of private homes. The transportation network is an interconnected system of streets and paths designed to be suitable for pedestrians and bicycles as well as automobiles. Equal attention is given to the public and private spaces creating a balanced community that services a wide range of homes and business owners. The addition of civic buildings and the reservation of open space in a TND enhance community identity and value. 
L.	Yard. The open space on a lot situated between the principal building on the lot and the lot line.

2.	General Considerations. 
2.1	Background. The City of Port Wentworth is undergoing a revitalization effort to reverse the trends of declining population that have occurred over the past ten years. The current heart of Port Wentworth is being impacted by activities of the neighboring Georgia Ports Authority, related private sector industries, and other impacts that are unsuitable for a residential area. These activities have resulted in acquisition of private homes and increased truck traffic on South Coastal Highway, which was once the city's commercial center. The City of Port Wentworth offers little to new businesses, other than industrial uses, or residents in the proximity of the core city. For this reason, the City is looking at the areas addressed through this overlay district as the focus of future development for Port Wentworth. These areas are largely undeveloped, with the exception of small pockets of residential development. Current expansion of water and sewer infrastructure will help foster development in this area. 
2.2	Guiding Principles. In order to foster growth that will lead to the type of community desired by the citizens of Port Wentworth, the City is preparing a master plan for development. This master plan is being developed based on the principles of traditional neighborhood development (TND). Over the past several decades, traditional zoning has promoted segregated land uses, excessive minimum lot sizes, and disconnected street patterns. These characteristics have largely contributed to traffic congestion, excessive reliance on automobile ownership, social inequity, and inefficient land use. Through the use of TND principles, the master plan will result in a community of connected neighborhoods with a distinct town center, rather than a series of isolated subdivisions and strip shopping centers. Certain areas will encourage residential units above retail shops, while other areas will allow a neighborhood store in close proximity to single-family housing. Neighborhoods will be connected through a grid street pattern and a multi-purpose trail system. 
2.3	Application Procedure. Projects in the Master Plan Design Districts that require subdivision must first prepare a master plan to be reviewed by the City. All master plans require review and approval by the Port Wentworth Planning Commission and City Council. The Port Wentworth Planning Commission has primary responsibility for review of proposed projects in the Master Plan Design Districts. It is strongly recommended that the property owners or developers submit the master plan of the proposed project to the Port Wentworth Planning Commission for informal staff review prior to their submittal of the final Master Plan and application. Staff is available to meet with property owners or developers. Conceptual designs may take the form of dimensioned sketches, or may be more refined. However, the graphics should enable staff to determine if there are obvious conflicts with applicable codes and regulations. 
Standard applications for zoning changes, ground disturbance permits, sign permits, and building permits shall be utilized for proposed projects in the Master Plan Design Districts. All applications within the boundaries of these districts shall clearly state that the project is located within the (appropriate name) Master Plan Design Districts. Procedures mandated in the City of Port Wentworth Zoning Ordinance, City of Port Wentworth Subdivision Ordinance, Section 5, and the Standard Building Code (SBCC) shall be followed. 
2.3.1	Approval. Approval by the Mayor and Council of the City of Port Wentworth of the Master Plan for a parcel submitted by an applicant shall establish the basic right of use and design for that parcel. Subsequent submittals of site plans, preliminary plats, and final plats shall be reviewed on the basis of consistency with the Master Plan. Street layout and location may vary from the approved Master Plan provided that street types comply with Section 3. 
2.4	Determination of applicable code requirements. Whenever a conflict exists between the requirements of the Master Plan Overlay District and any other section of the City of Port Wentworth Zoning and Subdivision Ordinance, the requirements of the Master Plan Overlay District apply. 
2.5	Reserved.

ARTICLE XIII. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT FACILITIES 

Section 13.1 - Findings; Public Purpose. 
Based on experiences of other urban counties and municipalities, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by Port Wentworth, Georgia, we take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attended to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. Moreover, it is the finding of the Mayor and Council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity are disorderly conduct, prostitution, drug trafficking, and drug use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas. Accordingly, it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety, and morals of the community to reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment facilities by avoiding the concentration of such uses, so as to reduce the negative impacts of adult entertainment facilities or adult uses upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semi-public uses; to insure that adult uses and adult entertainment facilities do not impede development, redevelopment, and neighborhood revitalization efforts; and so as to avoid allowing adult entertainment and adult uses in heavily used public pedestrian areas. Therefore, the limitation of adult uses and adult entertainment to certain prescribed areas of Port Wentworth is in the welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment or adult uses. To the end, this ordinance is hereby adopted. 
At the time of adoption of this Article, some of the behavior regulated herein is prohibited by Sections 15-2 and 15-4 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Port Wentworth. Nothing herein shall be construed to repeal or invalidate these provisions and it is the intent of the Mayor and Council that such conduct remain prohibited. However, in the event that the enforcement of Sections 15-2 and 15-4 are enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction, these provisions shall apply to all establishments falling within its restrictions during the continuation of such judicial intervention. During such a period, each such business must apply for a license. If they would qualify for such a business, the license and fee therefor shall be held by the City Clerk until resolution of the Judicial Intervention. If such person does not meet the minimum restrictions of this ordinance, then no license shall be issued and the applicant will cease such activity until such time as the minimum qualifications can be met. If the restrictions of Sections 15-2 and 15-4 are invalidated or repealed, these restrictions shall continue to apply to all such businesses.

15.5-3.1	Action on Preliminary Plat. If the Planning Commission finds that the proposed design of the subdivision shown on the preliminary plat complies with the design requirements of these regulations, it shall recommend approval of such preliminary plat to the Mayor and Council. If the Planning Commission finds that the proposed design of the subdivision shown on the preliminary plat does not comply with the design requirements of these regulations, then the Planning Commission shall either recommend disapproval of such plat or shall recommend approval of such plat on the condition that specified violations are corrected prior to the submittal of the final plat.

Such construction shall conform to the design of the preliminary plat as submitted to and approved by the mayor and council. 
15.5-3.3	Time Limit on Preliminary Plat Approval. The Mayor and Council's approval of a preliminary plat shall be valid for one (1) year. If work has not started on a subdivision which has been granted preliminary plat approval on or before the end of this one-year period, then the plat of such subdivision shall be resubmitted for preliminary approval; provided, however, that this time may be extended unless changes have occurred in this ordinance, or in the character of the property surrounding the property of the proposed subdivision, which make it necessary to revise the design of the proposed subdivision as determined by the Mayor and Council. 
15.5-4	Final Plat. Before a plat of a subdivision is recorded with the Clerk of the Superior Court of Chatham County and the lots thereon offered for sale, an original and four (4) prints of a final plat showing the final design of the subdivision shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for review. Until a final plat of a subdivision has been submitted to and reviewed by the Planning Commission and approved and signed by the Mayor and Clerk of the City, the Clerk of Superior Court of Chatham County shall not record the plat of such subdivision, nor shall the owner or agent of such subdivision be authorized to transfer or sell any of the land within such subdivision by reference to a plat. For large subdivisions the final plat may be submitted for approval progressively in contiguous sections satisfactory to the Planning Commission.

If lots are not to be served by either public sewers or public water, or both, then the final plat shall be accompanied by a certificate from the Chatham County Health Department certifying health department approval of the water supply system and/or waste disposal system to be used and health department approval of lot sizes and lot widths established in such subdivision. 
15.5-4.3	Certificate from Engineer. At the time the final plat is submitted, it shall be accompanied by a certificate from the developer's engineer certifying that the subdivider has complied with the following conditions: 
(a)	All improvements have been installed in accord with the requirements of this ordinance and the Flood Damage and Prevention Ordinance for the City of Port Wentworth and in accord with the design approved by the Mayor and Council on the preliminary plat; and 
(b)	Developer will provide a cash security payable to the City, in the amount of twenty-five percent 25%) of the total public infrastructure construction costs for roadways, drainage facilities, and appurtenances and ten percent (10%) of the total public infrastructure construction costs for water and sewage systems, with no security less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). The amount must be sufficient to cover all possible repairs required during the warranty/maintenance period. The developer must maintain the public infrastructure for the periods outlined below: 
(1)	Roadways, drainage facilities and appurtenances will be maintained by the developer for a period of two (2) years from the date of acceptance of the final plat. The two (2) year period shall not begin until after all infrastructure and inspections are completed with all deficiencies corrected. The date of the beginning of the maintenance period shall be set by Mayor and Council upon acceptance of the final plat. The developer must request in writing that the City take the roadways, drainage facilities, and appurtenances for maintenance at the end of the two (2) year period. The request may be filed with the City no sooner than forty-five (45) business days prior to the end of the period. The City must notify the developer of deficiencies or needed repairs within thirty (30) business days of the request. A notice of needed repairs or deficiencies will require that the developer extend the bond for a period of six months to allow for time to correct such deficiencies or needed repairs. If the needed repairs or deficiencies continue to exist at the expiration of the extended maintenance period, the bond will be extended by such a period as identified by the Mayor and Council. The developer may request in writing that the City accept the roadways, drainage facilities, and appurtenances prior to the end of the extended maintenance period, if all deficiencies and needed repairs have been satisfactorily corrected. The Mayor and Council shall determine whether to accept the infrastructure within forty-five (45) business days after all needed repairs and deficiencies have been satisfactorily corrected. 
(2)	Water and sewage systems will be maintained by the developer for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of acceptance of the final plat. The twelve month period shall not begin until after all water and sewer infrastructure and inspections are complete with all deficiencies corrected. The date of the beginning of the twelve (12) month period shall be set by the Mayor and Council upon acceptance of the final plat. The developer must request in writing that the City take the water and sewerage systems for maintenance at the end of the twelve (12) month period. The request may be filed with the City no sooner than forty-five (45) business days prior to the end of the period. The City must notify the developer of deficiencies or needed repairs within thirty (30) business days of the request. A notice of needed repairs or deficiencies will require that the developer extend the bond for a period of six months to allow for time to correct such deficiencies or needed repairs. If the needed repairs or deficiencies continue to exist at the expiration of the extended maintenance period, the bond will be extended by such a period as identified by the Mayor and Council. The developer may request in writing that the City accept the water and sewerage systems prior to the end of the extended maintenance period, if all deficiencies and needed repairs have been satisfactorily corrected. The Mayor and Council shall determine whether to accept the infrastructure within forty-five (45) business days after all needed repairs and deficiencies have been satisfactorily corrected. 
(3)	The developer shall post separate bonds for (1) the water and sewerage systems and (2) roadways, drainage facilities, and appurtenances. 
(4)	Should the developer construct and install water and sewage infrastructure that serves or is intended to serve multiple phases of a project (i.e. beyond a 60-lot maximum initial phase), the developer may request that the portion of the required security derived from the construction cost of that infrastructure be prorated across each proposed phase of the project. Proration of any part of the required cash security will be at the sole discretion of Mayor and Council. 
(c)	The security shall only be released at the request of the developer. In no event will the security be released prior to forty-five (45) business days before the maintenance period ends. Release of the security shall be by formal action of the Mayor and Council. 
(d)	The security will be forfeited to the City after a period of ten (10) years from the date of the approval of the final plat for the initial phase of the subdivision by the Mayor and Council, should the public infrastructure be incomplete and unaccepted by the City at the end of the ten (10) year period. 
(e)	The developer shall execute a maintenance agreement suitable in form to the city attorney prior to the approval of the final plat. 
(f)	Subdivisions shall be developed in phases of no more than sixty (60) lots each.

15.5-4.4	Filing the Final Plat. The final plat shall be filed with the planning commission not less than twenty (20) business days prior to a regular meeting of the planning commission at which such plat is to be heard. 
15.5-4.5	If the Planning Commission finds that all the requirements of this ordinance have been met, it shall recommend approval of the final plat and submit such plat to the Mayor and Council. If the Planning Commission finds that all the requirements of this ordinance have not been met, and after deficiencies have been discussed and reviewed with the developer, and the developer given a period of time which shall not exceed ninety (90) business days to take corrective action, then the Planning Commission shall recommend disapproval of the final plat to the Mayor and Council and shall set forth its reasons for such recommendation in writing. Except where an extension of time is authorized by the applicant for final plat review, the Planning Commission shall have thirty (30) business days from the date of the submittal of a final plat to the Mayor and Council to approve or disapprove the final plat. Unless such action is taken within such thirty-day period, then such plat shall be deemed to have received a recommendation for approval from the Planning Commission and the Mayor and Council may take final action on such plat without waiting further for the recommendations of the Planning Commission. 
(a)	When the final plat has been approved, the Planning Commission shall present the final plat to the Clerk of the Superior Court of Chatham County to be recorded. The Planning Commission shall provide the subdivider with the subdivision map book number and page number in which the subdivision has been recorded by the Clerk of the Superior Court. The cost of such recording shall be paid by the subdivider and shall be deposited with the City Clerk prior to such recording. 
(b)	After the final plat of the subdivision has been recorded, then all lots shown on such subdivision may be made available for sale and such subdivision shall be entitled to all privileges and services available to other subdivisions within the City. 
15.5-5	Revisions to Recorded Plat. 
(a)	Major Revisions: The subdivider shall file with the Planning Commission copies of the proposed revision to a recorded plat together with all supporting information as required by these regulations. Proposed revisions to a recorded plat which alter or change in any way the street and/or utility layout of said plat shall be submitted and processed as a preliminary plat. 
(b)	Minor Revisions: Proposed revisions to a recorded plat which do not alter or change in any way the street and/or utility layout of said plat shall be submitted as follows: 
The subdivider shall file with the Planning Commission four (4) copies of the original plat with all minor revisions shown in red. The plats shall be accompanied by a statement signed by all affected property owners acknowledging their awareness and approval of the revisions. Proposed revisions shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission. Upon a finding that revisions comply with all applicable regulations, the revised plats shall be submitted to the Mayor and Council for approval. One (1) copy of the approved plat shall be recorded and one (1) copy shall be attached to the originally recorded plat as part of the public record. 
15.5-6	Minor Subdivision. Minor subdivisions may be submitted as final plats, and shall comply with the requirements of these regulations, including minimum finished floor elevation requirements, with the following exceptions: 
(a)	Minor subdivisions shall be processed as major subdivisions if requested by either the Planning Commission or the Mayor and Council. 
(b)	Topographic information shall not be required unless specifically requested by the Planning Commission or the Mayor and Council.

(d)	The developer shall submit a drainage plan for approval if requested by the Planning Commission or the Mayor and Council. 
(e)	Provided that where a series of minor subdivisions are developed or proposed immediately adjacent to one another, the Planning Commission or Mayor and Council may require the developer to comply with the procedures for major subdivisions. 
(f)	Residential lots having peculiar shape or topography may be approved utilizing private driveway access easements, provided the purpose and intent of these regulations are met. However, it is not the intent to approve under this provision a subdivision where a lot is to be served with a private driveway access easement and such lot or remaining tract of land can be further subdivided under the provisions of the ordinance. Such easements shall have a minimum width of twenty-two (22) feet and shall serve no more than two (2) additional lots. The following notation shall be placed on the subdivision plat and shall be in capital letters in pica size type: 
"The private driveway access easement is hereby dedicated perpetually for use by the owners and residents of all lots within this subdivision and will not be maintained by the City. Port Wentworth shall have no responsibility for the drainage of the lots nor for the furnishing or maintenance of services or utilities to the lots within the subdivision fronting on said private driveway. All utilities within the private driveway shall remain the responsibility of the owner or owners and not Port Wentworth." 
This provision will only be applicable to minor subdivision for the purposes of single-family use.

ARTICLE VI. - GENERAL PURPOSE 

Section 6-1. - Airspace zoning map adopted. 
There are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying within the primary zone, precision instrument approach zones, nonprecision instrument approach zones, transition zones, horizontal zones and conical zones. Such areas and zones are shown on the Savannah International Airport Airspace Zoning Map dated June 1, 1985. Said map is made a part of this ordinance to the same extent as if the information set forth on such map was fully designed and incorporated herein, and may be amended subsequent to the adoption thereof. Said map shall be kept on file in the office of the clerk of council of the city. The various zones established are shown in Illustration Number 1 and are defined as follows. 
Section 6-2. - Primary zone. 
An area longitudinally centered on a runway and extending two hundred (200) feet each end of that runway. The width of the primary zone is one thousand (1,000) feet for a nonprecision instrument runway having a nonprecision instrument approach with visibility minimum as low as three-fourths (¾) of a statute mile, and for precision instrument runways. No structure or obstruction will be permitted within the primary zone that is not part of the landing and take off facilities and is of a greater height than the nearest point on the runway center line. 
Section 6-3. - Approach zones. 
An area longitudinal centered on the extended runway center line and extending outward from each end of the primary zone. An approach zone is designed for each runway based upon the type of approach available or planned for that runway end. 
(a)	Precision instrument approach zone. An instrument approach zone is established at each end of precision instrument runways. The inner edge of the precision instrument approach zone shall have a width of one thousand (1,000) feet at a distance of two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of the runway. The inner edge shall then widen uniformly to a width of sixteen thousand (16,000) feet at a distance of fifty thousand two hundred (50,200) feet beyond each end of the runway. 
(b)	Nonprecision instrument approach zones. Nonprecision instrument approach zones are established at each end of the nonprecision runways. The inner edge of the nonprecision instrument approach zone shall have a width of one thousand (1,000) feet at a distance of two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of the runway. The inner edge shall then widen uniformly to a width of four thousand (4,000) feet for that end of a nonprecision instrument runway having a nonprecision instrument approach with visibility minimums as low as three-fourths statute mile. This type of approach zone extends to a horizontal distance of ten thousand two hundred (10,200) feet beyond each end of the runway. 
Section 6-4. - Transitional zones. 
Transitional zones are established adjacent to each precision and nonprecision instrument runway. They extend outward from the sides of the primary and approach zones and connect to the horizontal and conical zones. Transitional zones are further established adjacent to the precision instrument approach zone which projects through and beyond the limits of the conical zone, extending a distance of five thousand (5,000) feet measured horizontally from the edge of the precision instrument approach zone perpendicular to the extended center line of the runway. 
Section 6-5. - Horizontal zone. 
(a)	A horizontal zone is the area within the perimeter of a horizontal plane that is constructed by swinging arcs of specified radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway of each airport and connecting the adjacent arcs by lines tangent to those arcs. The radius of each arc is ten thousand (10,000) feet for all runways at the airport. 
(b)	The radius of the arc specified for each end of a runway will have the same arithmetical value. That value will be the highest composite value determined for either end of the runway. When a five thousand-foot arc is encompassed by tangents connecting two (2) adjacent ten thousand-foot arcs, the five thousand-foot arc shall be disregarded on the construction of the perimeter of the horizontal plane. The horizontal zone does not include the precision and nonprecision approach zones, and the transition zones. 
Section 6-6. - Conical zone. 
A conical zone is established as the area that begins at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of four thousand (4,000) feet. The conical zone does not include the approach zones and transition zones. 
ARTICLE VII. - HEIGHT LIMIT 

Section 7-1. - Limitation on structures and trees. 
Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in any zone to a height in excess of the height limit herein established for such zone. If any structure or tree is erected, altered, allowed to grow, or maintained in an area located in more than one (1) zone, then that structure or tree will be considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows. 
Section 7-2. - Precision instrument approach zone. 
One foot in height for each fifty (50) feet in horizontal distance, beginning at a point two hundred (200) feet from and at the center line elevation of the end of the instrument runway and extending to a distance of ten thousand two hundred (10,200) feet from the end of the runway; thence one (1) foot in height for each forty (40) feet in horizontal distance to a point fifty thousand two hundred (50,200) feet from the end of the runway. 
Section 7-3. - Nonprecision instrument approach zone. 
One foot vertically for each thirty-four (34) feet in horizontal distance, beginning at a point two hundred (200) feet from and at the center line elevation of the nonprecision instrument runway and extending to a point ten thousand two hundred (10,200) feet from the end of the runway. 
Section 7-4. - Transitional zone. 
This area extending outward from the sides of the primary zone and approach zones connecting them to the horizontal and conical zones. Height limits within the transitional zone are the same as the primary zone or approach zone at the boundary line where it adjoins and increases at a rate of one (1) foot vertically for every seven (7) feet horizontally, with the horizontal distance measured at right angles to the runway center line and extended center line, until the height matches the height of the horizontal zone or conical zone, or for a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet from the side of the part of the precision approach zone that extends beyond the conical zone. 
Section 7-5. - Horizontal zone. 
One hundred fifty (150) feet above established airport elevation. 
Section 7-6. - Conical zone. 
The area extending outward from the periphery of the horizontal zone for a distance of four thousand (4,000) feet. Height limitations for structures in the conical zone are one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport height at the inner boundary with permitted height increasing one (1) foot vertically every twenty (20) feet to a height of three hundred fifty (350) feet above the airport elevation. 
ARTICLE VIII. - NONCONFORMING OBSTRUCTIONS 
The regulations prescribed by this ordinance shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations when adopted or amended, or to otherwise interfere with the continuance of any nonconforming use. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in the construction or alteration of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the adoption of or to any amendments to this ordinance and is diligently prosecuted and completed within six (6) months thereof. 
ARTICLE IX. - PERMITS 

Section 9-1. - Permit required for nonconforming structures. 
No nonconforming structures or trees may be erected, replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher or replanted in any zone created in this ordinance unless a permit is secured from the zoning administrator authorizing such replacement, change or repair, except as follows: 
(a)	No permit shall be required for any structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when because of terrain, land contour or topographic features such structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for the following areas: 
(1)	Within the entire limits of the horizontal, conical or transitional zones. 
(2)	Within the limits of the precision instrument approach zones. 
Section 9-2. - Application indicating purpose. 
Each application shall indicate the purpose for which it is desired, with sufficient particularity to determine whether the resulting use or structure would conform to the regulations prescribed in this ordinance. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit applied for shall be granted. 
Section 9-3. - Permit restrictions. 
No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming use, structure or tree to be made or become higher, or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the effective date of this ordinance, or than it is when the application for a permit is made. 
Section 9-4. - Abandonment, destroyed or decayed structure. 
Whenever the zoning administrator determines that a nonconforming use, or nonconforming structure or tree, has been abandoned or is more than seventy (70) per cent torn down, destroyed, deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow said structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limits or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
ARTICLE X. - HAZARD MARKING AND LIGHTING REQUIRED 
Any permit granted under Article IX of this ordinance may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purposes of this ordinance and reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the airport commission, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard. 
ARTICLE XI. - REMOVAL OF NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES 
The airport commission may negotiate with owners of nonconforming structures for removal, lighting or marking of existing nonconforming structures, to be installed, operated and maintained at the commission's expense. 
ARTICLE XII. - VARIANCES PROHIBITED 
No variances, special exceptions or any other appeal within any zone created by this ordinance shall be considered or granted which would violate any restrictions imposed by this ordinance. 
ARTICLE XIII. - ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY 
The zoning administrator is hereby designated the administrative agency charged with the duty of administering and enforcing the regulations prescribed by this ordinance. The duties of the zoning administrator shall include that of hearing and deciding all applications for permits. 
ARTICLE XIV. - PENALTIES 
Any person convicted of violating any provision of this ordinance shall be subject to a fine not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) or imprisonment not to exceed thirty (30) days, or both, and shall be required to remove the subject obstruction.
