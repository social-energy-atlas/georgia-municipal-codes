PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of LaGrange of a general and permanent nature. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1972 Code, as supplemented through August 14, 1984, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1972 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in topical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of three component parts separated by dashes, the first referring to the title number, the second figure referring to the chapter number and the third figure referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 30-1 is numbered 30-1-1 and the third section of Chapter 5-1 is 5-1-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its title and chapter and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 1-1-7 and 1-1-8 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 1-1-7.1, 1-1-7.2 and 1-1-7.3, respectively. New titles or chapters may be included by the use of numbers reserved for such purpose. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way as new sections or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments

(c)  Also within seven (7) calendar days of the filing of the complaint, the assistant city manager shall forward a copy of the complaint to the ethics hearing officer who shall review it to determine whether the complaint is unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or fails to state facts sufficient to invoke the disciplinary jurisdiction of this article. The hearing officer is empowered to dismiss in writing complaints that are determined to be unjustified, frivolous, patently unfounded or fail to state facts sufficient to invoke the disciplinary jurisdiction of the city council; provided, however, that a rejection of such complaint by the hearing officer shall not deprive the complaining party of any action such party might otherwise have at law or in equity against the city official.

Moreover, complaints shall only be accepted for actions alleged to have occurred subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, June 1, 2014. Resignation of a city official subsequent to the initiation of a complaint hereunder, but prior to action by the mayor and council pursuant to section 5-5-25(g), shall divest the council and the hearing officer of jurisdiction of the complaint and thereby terminate such proceedings.

Sec. 15-10-24. - Residential garbage collection service levels; container location. 
Three (3) levels of service for the collection of residential solid waste are provided by the city: 
(1)  Curbside garbage collection: By 6:30 a.m. on the scheduled day for collection, customers place their container on the street shoulder in front of their residence. Containers should be placed approximately four feet from the edge of the roadway, but not so as to pose a physical or visual obstruction to motorists. Where there is insufficient right-of-way adjacent to the roadway, or other topographical difficulties exist which make it unreasonable to conform to the general requirements, customers should place their container at a location mutually agreeable to the customer and solid waste division, after consultation with the solid waste superintendent or his designee. All containers shall be removed from the curbside and returned to the customer's residence no later than 8:00 a.m. on the day following the day of service. 
(2)  Assisted service for households with mobility-impaired residents: Households in which all regular residents are mobility-impaired may apply for assisted collection service at the same fee as levied for curbside collection. City personnel will enter upon the customer's property to collect their solid waste from city-issued container(s) on the scheduled day of collection. 
(3)  Premium service: City personnel will enter upon a customer's property to collect their solid waste from city-issued container(s) on the scheduled day of collection if the customer subscribes to this service level. 
For households subscribing to "premium" service or for those households with mobility-impaired residents, the city-issued container(s) shall be placed so that the collector shall not be required to go more than twenty (20) feet beyond the edge of the driveway, preferably visible from the street. Containers located on private property shall not be serviced until clear access is provided to both the collection vehicle and the path the collector must travel to access container. No containers should be located within garages, carports, basements, breezeways, fenced enclosures or otherwise in the vicinity of articles not considered to be waste by the resident. Collectors shall not be required to collect solid waste from any premises where an animal considered to be vicious is maintained without restraint. If it is not practical to place the container(s) for collection at the location above specified, the solid waste superintendent shall designate the location of the container(s). The owner, his agent or occupant of any residential property, shall release the city from any claim of damage of any kind or nature that may result to the premises or persons located thereon, or for any other claim of damages that may result in the servicing of the residential property because of the entry upon private property. 
(Ord. No. 96-11, § 1, 2-27-96; Ord. No. 02-24, § 1, 8-27-02) 
Sec. 15-10-25. - Residential garbage collection practices. 
(a)  Garbage accumulated by residents and properly placed in approved containers shall be collected once each week. 
(b)  Customers placing their garbage at the curbside may utilize either sixty-eight (68) or ninety-six (96) gallon containers provided by the city. Customers subscribing to "premium" service or households with mobility-impaired residents receiving assisted service shall utilize only ninety-six (96) gallon containers provided by the city. 
(c)  Newspaper and cardboard that has been broken down, neatly stacked and tied may be stored adjacent to garbage containers placed curbside for collection. Such uncontainerized solid waste is limited to these two (2) items and shall be limited to one-half cubic yard in size. 
(d)  Household garbage shall be drained of all liquids prior to its being placed in solid waste containers. 
(e)  Pet litter shall be placed in securely tied in a plastic bag not to exceed ten (10) pounds in weight and placed in the container. 
(f)  Disposable diapers shall be placed and tied securely in plastic bags. 
(g)  Packing materials such as styrofoam pellets, excelsior, etc., that can be easily scattered by the elements shall be placed in taped boxes or plastic bags. 
(h)  Customers are responsible for keeping containers clean and free of accumulated waste. Containers may be cleaned with a mild detergent and/or treated with an effective insecticide, if necessary, to prevent a nuisance. Bagging of all waste deposited in the city provided container will minimize the need for cleaning.

Sec. 15-10-26. - Duty of owner/occupant to see that containers are emptied and maintained; lost, stolen or damaged containers. 
Every owner, occupant, tenant, or lessee of a house or building used for residential, business, commercial or other purposes, is required to maintain responsibility and surveillance over the solid waste receptacles on his/her premises. For households subscribing to curbside garbage collection, it is the owner or occupants responsibility to insure that the container(s) is (are) located on the curb by 6:30 a.m. on the regularly scheduled collection day. For households subscribing to "premium" service, it is the owner or occupants responsibility to insure that the container(s) is (are) located within twenty (20) feet of the driveway by 6:30 a.m. on the regularly scheduled day of collection. City solid waste collectors shall not be responsible for picking up loose and scattered solid waste resulting from improper containerization or lack of maintenance of the generator's solid waste storage area. 
Any residential container provided by the city which becomes lost or stolen shall be replaced by the city and shall be paid for by the owner of the residence to which the container is assigned. Containers which are damaged through normal usage shall be repaired or replaced by the city. Containers which are damaged through no fault of the city are paid for by the owner of the residence to which the container is assigned.

Sec. 15-10-27. - Trash collection practices. 
Solid waste or trash of such a nature that it cannot be placed in a receptacle may be placed at the curbside or street side for collection by the city. Such solid waste shall be placed on public right-of-way and collected for disposal twice per month according to the following standards: 
(1)  Debris shall not extend over the sidewalk so as to block pedestrian traffic or fall into or extend over the street so as to hinder vehicular traffic or make it difficult to use motor-driven sweepers. 
(2)  Debris shall not be placed in the gutter, in any ditch or other path of storm water runoff. 
(3)  Trash shall be placed on the right-of-way immediately adjacent to the property from which the trash originated. Trash shall not be placed on vacant lots, parks, across the street from the property on which the trash originated or on another person's property. 
(4)  Trash shall not be placed over stormwater catchbasins, water meters or valve boxes, underneath overhead utility lines or low tree branches, in the vicinity of utility poles and/or guy wires, trees, mailboxes, fire hydrants or steep banks that may impede the collection of the waste, increase the risk of damage to utilities by mechanized loading equipment, or otherwise compromise the safety of the collectors.

(1)  Residential. Using information furnished by the applicant for service, previous utility payment history of the applicant, and other relevant data available together with credit information received from a third-party credit agency, the customer service division of the utilities department of the city will make a risk assessment of each applicant to categorize such applicant as low, average or high risk in order that an appropriate deposit can be required of such applicant as follows: (i) low risk applicants shall not be required to pay a deposit; (ii) average risk applicants will pay a deposit of fifty dollars ($50.00) for one (1) service, one hundred dollars ($100.00) for two (2) services and one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) for three (3) or more services; (iii) high risk applicants will pay a deposit of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for one (1) service, two hundred dollars ($200.00) for two (2) services and three hundred dollars ($300.00) for three (3) or more services; (iv) applicants having no credit history will be charged the average risk deposit; (v) applicants who shall refuse to provide information necessary for performance of an applicable credit investigation or other relevant information must pay the high risk deposit amount.

(3)  Other commercial/industrial. The deposit for a commercial/industrial applicant not covered in subparagraph (2) above shall be twice the amount of the anticipated monthly bill for utility services as estimated and determined by the customer service division of the utility department of the city. The deposit level for an existing commercial account shall be reviewed regularly and may be adjusted as necessary to equal double the monthly bill. The city manager shall have the authority to increase or decrease the deposit amount for franchises, large retail chains, and industrial customers based on a current assessment of credit worthiness. 
(4)  A deposit when and if required, may be made either in cash, by irrevocable letter of credit, or by bond with good, adequate surety. The term of any such letter of credit or surety bond and the institution or person providing such letter of credit or surety bond must be approved by the customer service division. 
(5)  Organizations operated solely for non-profit or charitable purposes and governmental organizations shall not be required to pay a deposit for utility services. 
(6)  Residential utility deposits existing on the date fixed in subparagraph (a) are grandfathered and not covered by the provisions of Ordinance No. 96-52 and will not be increased or decreased unless or until the customer shall transfer service, request additional or modified services, or request new services following termination for nonpayment. 
(c)  Deposit-increase. Based upon credit investigation, past history of credit utility service and failure to pay therefor and any other facts deemed appropriate the customer service division of the utilities department shall be authorized to increase up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) the deposit required to receive new or modified utility services. The amount of any unpaid debts due to the city for prior utility service must be paid before new or modified services shall commence. Additionally, customers within the category described in this subparagraph shall also be subject to having utility services terminated for failure to pay any past due amount without any prior notice from the city. 
(d)  Billing. 
(1)  All utility bills rendered by the city shall show thereon the billing date and the due date. With the exception of industrial customers, the penalty for failure to pay on or before the due date specified in this paragraph shall be two dollars ($2.00) or five (5) percent of the current month's portion of the bill, (i.e. excluding arrears), whichever is greater. The due date for all customers other than industrial customers shall be not less than fourteen (14) days after the billing date; provided, however, that for any commercial customer whose utility bill is mailed or forwarded for processing and payment to an address or location which is outside or beyond the limits of Troup County, the due date for any such commercial customer shall be not less than twenty-one (21) days after the billing date. 
(2)  If any utility customer, other than an industrial customer, shall fail to pay a utility bill by the due date and such customer has not been late in the payment of a utility bill during the immediately preceding eleven (11) calendar months, all applicable late fees will be waived by the city provided such utility bill is paid on or before the disconnection date fixed pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (f) hereof. 
(3)  The penalty to an industrial customer for failure to pay on or before the due date specified in this section shall be the greater of two dollars ($2.00) or one and one-half (1.5) percent of the current month's portion of the bill (i.e., excluding arrears). The due date for industrial customers shall be not less than thirty (30) days after the billing date shown on the utility bill. 
The term "industrial customer" as used herein is a city utility customer who is engaged primarily in the business of manufacturing, assembling, producing, and/or finishing and which does not qualify as a residential, commercial, or institutional customer of the city based on historical uses, customs and practices of the city utility department. 
(4)  The requirement contained herein for the payment of a penalty for failure to pay or for late payment of a utility bill shall apply to all utility customers of the city including but not limited to the City of LaGrange or the LaGrange Board of Education. 
(5)  If a utility bill shall show a due date which falls on or after the twenty-fifth day of any month but prior to the fourth day of the succeeding month, the due date of such bill shall be automatically extended to the close of business on the fifth day of such succeeding month provided the customer to which such bill is directed shall meet the current total income limitations now or hereafter specified in chapter 20-20 of this Code. Any customer desiring to take advantage of the automatic extension provided hereby prior to receiving the same must make application to the assistant city manager of the city for approval of such extension, and the assistant city manager shall automatically submit a list of those approved to the mayor and council for annual approval. 
If the fifth day of the succeeding month specified herein shall fall on a weekend, a holiday or other nonbusiness day, the due date shall be the next day thereafter which is a business day. 
(6)  Payments placed in the night deposit box outside city hall will be credited as received the next business day. 
(e)  Adjustments to bills. In the event a utility reading is required to be estimated and the necessity of such estimated reading was due to fault or failure of the city, if such fault or failure is not cured or corrected within sixty (60) days after the first estimated reading, the bill shall thereafter be based upon zero consumption and only base charges shall thereafter be assessed until the failure or fault is cured or corrected. When the failure or fault is corrected during such sixty-day period, the customer shall pay the estimated cost of utilities until the cost for estimation is corrected and thereafter shall pay the actual cost of the utilities. If the necessity for estimating utility service is due to fault or failure of the customer which shall continue for a period of sixty (60) days, at the end of such sixty-day period, the customer will be notified in writing to correct the problem, and thereafter the city may continue the estimated billing or may terminate utility service. The customer will be required to pay the amount of any increased back bills, and the excess charges, if any, shall be credited to the customer's account. For commercial and industrial metering problems which require an estimation of service, if the estimate shall result in overpayment, the bill shall be adjusted as required to correct any overpayment, the bill shall be adjusted only for twelve (12) months and any amount due for such twelve-month period shall be paid by the customer. 
(f)  Delinquent accounts. As soon as practical after the due date, customers with unpaid utility bills shall be notified in writing that their utility account is delinquent and that service may be terminated. Such notice of delinquency shall include: 
(1)  The utility account number and the address therefor; 
(2)  The amount of the bill; 
(3)  The reason for the proposed disconnection; 
(4)  The date by which the bill must be paid to avoid disconnection; and 
(5)  The telephone number and the name of a responsible person whom the customer may call for information concerning the delinquent account and the proposed disconnection of service. 
If the customer has not paid all past due and current month utility charges by the due date printed on the notice of delinquency, then utility services may be terminated. 
(g)  Administrative and connection fees. The fee charged to establish service for a new customer, transfer service for an existing customer, re-establish service that has been disconnected or scheduled for disconnection due to nonpayment, or reconnect service that has been disconnected for any reason shall be as listed below. Normal business hours are defined as the hours during which the customer service office is open to the public. 
(1)  Requests submitted during normal business hours shall incur a fee of ..... $30.00 
(2)  Requests submitted after normal business hours, accompanied by documentation showing current payment status and further approved by the director of utilities or his designee, shall incur a fee of ..... 40.00 
(3)  Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2) above, requests submitted to turn on a gas meter that has been turned off at the request of customer for the summer season shall incur a seasonal reconnect fee of ..... 40.00 
(4)  No connection or reconnection fee shall be charged to the owner of a residential rental property if such owner has entered into a continuous service agreement with the city, the terms of which shall provide for full payment of future utility services by owner. 
(h)  Payment of unpaid bills and debts, service termination. Any applicant for utility service who owes an unpaid utility bill or other debt to the city, including but not limited to court judgments and fines, shall pay such unpaid bill or debt prior to obtaining utility service. Additionally, customers who owe debts to the city of any type shall be subject to having utility services terminated for failure to pay said debts without any prior notice from the city. 
(i)  Disposition of deposit. The utility deposit required by subsection (b) shall be retained by the city, without interest, for so long as service is provided by the city to the customer and may be applied by the city to payment of that customer's past due bill and upon termination of service for any reason, the balance of the deposit, if any, after deducting unpaid bills, shall be refunded to the customer. Any customer in making a subsequent application for service may be required to make another utility deposit as required hereby. 
(j)  Unclaimed deposits. Any utility deposit required to be made in accordance with the terms of this section, which is unclaimed for a period of five (5) years after service is discontinued, shall become a part of the utility fund and applied to unpaid and uncollectible bills of the utility system. 
(k)  When no new or additional deposit is required. An existing business or commercial establishment shall not be required to make a new or make an additional utility deposit by virtue of moving the same business to a different location in the city, rebuilding at the same location or adding one (1) or more additional locations within the city.

Sec. 20-1-8. - Exceptions to termination. 
(a)  Disconnection during illness. 
(1)  Service will not be disconnected or terminated for nonpayment of a utility bill rendered to a residential customer when such customer or a family member residing at the residence has a serious illness if disconnection or termination of utilities would create a life-threatening situation. The customer must present a written statement from the physician, hospital, clinic or other recognized medical authority identifying the illness, the anticipated duration of such illness and certifying that the utility disconnection would be life-threatening and specifying the particular utility services which are required by the customer as a result of such illness. In such event, the proposed disconnection shall be held in abeyance for the shorter of either the length of the illness or sixty (60) days from the date of such initial written statement. 
At the end of such sixty-day period, the customer must pay the subsequent monthly bills when due and, in addition, must pay not less than fifty (50) percent of the amount past due because of such delay of discontinuance or termination. If suitable arrangement for payment acceptable to the city cannot be made, or if the customer fails to make payments as specified, the city may discontinue the utility service. 
(2)  Service will not be disconnected or terminated for nonpayment of a utility bill rendered to a residential customer if such customer or family member residing at the residence has a serious illness which would be aggravated by such disconnection or termination. The customer must present a written statement from a physician, hospital, clinic or other recognized medical authority identifying the illness, the anticipated duration of such illness and certifying that the illness would be aggravated by such utility disconnection and specifying the particular utility services which are required by the customer as a result of such illness. In such event, the proposed disconnection shall be held in abeyance for the shorter of either the length of the illness or thirty (30) days from the date of such initial written statement. 
At the end of such thirty-day period, the customer must begin paying the current bill each month in addition to not less than fifty (50) percent of the past due because of such delay of this continuance or termination. If suitable arrangement for payment acceptable to the city cannot be made, or if a customer fails to make payments as specified, the city may discontinue the utility service. 
(b)  Hardship restrictions. For those residential customers whose utility services are scheduled to be discontinued or terminated for nonpayment during the period of any month beginning on the first day and extending through the fifth day of any such month and who meet the income definitions and requirements now or hereafter set forth in section 20-20-1 and the limitations on income now or hereafter set forth in section 20-20-3(2), upon making written application therefor, shall be exempt from having such utility service terminated provided such utility bill is paid on or before the close of business on the fifth day of such month and provided further that (1) such utilities are in the name of the person making the application for exemption from discontinuance or termination; and (2) appropriate information relating to income of the applicant and the household which is acceptable to the city, shall be provided. 
If the utility bill is not paid in full prior to the close of business on the fifth day of the exemption period, the utility service may be discontinued or terminated on or after the sixth day of such month and another application for exemption under this subparagraph cannot be made and will not be granted for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of the scheduled termination or discontinuance of such service. 
(c)  Seasonal restrictions. Any other rules and regulations notwithstanding, the city shall not discontinue those services to a residential heating customer which are integral to and required for heating such residence as the result of an unpaid utility bill incurred during the winter months from December 1 through the subsequent March 15 if the forecasted local low temperature for a twenty-four-hour period beginning at 8:00 a.m. on the date of the proposed disconnection is below thirty-two (32) degrees Fahrenheit. This restriction will not in any way affect the ability of the city to discontinue water or other utilities not required for heating of the residence.

a.  Are electric and/or gas customers of the city, either residential customers or small commercial customers with an average bill of no more than $5,000.00 per month; 
b.  Such customer has exercised the option in writing and elected to receive levelized billing; 
c.  Such customer has not been scheduled for or has not had his utility service discontinued for nonpayment in the immediately preceding twelve (12) months and is not currently in arrears. 
(2)  a.  The monthly levelized billing amount will be calculated by the city averaging the current months charges with all charges for utility services for the immediate past eleven (11) months, excluding for both periods, fixed charges as defined herein, taxes and any late charges. All appropriate taxes will be billed based on the current month actual charges and late charges will be assessed, if applicable; 
b.  The city may in its discretion adjust the levelized billing amount to recover or refund any rate increases or decreases or to adjust for abnormal weather conditions during the fiscal year.

(4)  If a utility customer shall move to a location not serviced by the city, the balance owed by such customer or the credit due to the customer will be applied to the final bill. If the final billing results in a balance due to the customer, a refund check will be issued to the customer but if there is a balance due to the city, such balance shall be due in full and shall be paid by the due date reflected on the bill; 
(5)  If service to a customer shall be cut off or terminated for nonpayment, the account balance is due and must be paid prior to reconnection. Twelve (12) consecutive months of service without termination for nonpayment shall be required before eligibility is restored; 
(6)  A utility customer transferring to another eligible location serviced by the city may continue on the levelized billing plan. The billing history of the new location will be used to calculate the level payment amount. If sufficient history is not available due to prolonged vacancy or because the account is new, only the available monthly charges will be averaged and if no history is available, the first months bill be the actual charges and averaging will commence with the second month; 
(7)  Fixed charges as used herein shall mean and include water line extension charges, propane to natural gas conversion contract charges, contributions to the share program, elderly discount charges, garbage collection fees, security light fees and fire services fees; and 
(8)  Applications for eligible small commercial customers shall be taken only in the months of September, October, November, March, April and May of each year.

Bids will be solicited from time to time by the city for excess natural gas and propane-air capacity that will be made available at the sole discretion of the city to preferred interruptible customers. The minimum bid and default charge is currently fourteen cents ($0.14) per therm. 
(5)  Purchased gas adjustment: The amount calculated at the above rate will be increased under the provisions of the city's purchased gas adjustment schedule. 
(6)  BTU adjustment: Gas volumes metered in hundreds of cubic feet shall be multiplied by the factor in the city's BTU adjustment schedule in order to determine the number of therms consumed for billing purposes. The measurement of gas volumes shall be adjusted to standard temperature and pressure. 
(7)  Unauthorized use of gas: The city shall have the right at any time following one-hour notice to interrupt or limit the quantity of gas it delivers to a customer under this rate schedule. If a customer refuses to honor said limitation notice, the customer shall pay a penalty charge equal to one dollar fifty cents ($1.50) multiplied by each therm delivered or taken in violation of said limitation notice in addition to the delivery and purchased gas adjustment charges for such gas. The payment of a penalty charge shall not, under any circumstances, be considered as giving the customer the right to take unauthorized gas. 
(8)  Emergency gas: If a customer finds it impossible to continue operations on standby fuel because of some bona fide emergency during a limitation period, the city may, at its sole discretion, furnish emergency gas service upon request out of its storage or peak shaving facilities. The customer shall pay a premium for each therm delivered under emergency service calculated to recover the additional costs associated with delivery of this gas, and the city may discontinue this service at any time. 
(9)  Alternate fuel discount: In the event a customer desires to burn an alternate fuel in lieu of natural gas, the city may at its sole discretion discount the distribution charge stated above. The customer must contact the city and provide adequate proof that the delivered price of the alternate fuel is less than the total monthly charge stated above and that natural gas consumption will definitely be reduced if a discount is not offered. 
(10)  Round-up: Customers that do not notify the city of their desire to opt-out will have the total of their utility charges rounded up to the next whole dollar. The proceeds of this round-up will be used to assist low income customers pay their utility bills or as otherwise directed by the LaGrange City Council. 
(h)  Fixed gas cost service. For any industrial or large commercial customer using more than one hundred thousand (100,000) ccf per year and desiring to stabilize cost of gas for some future billing period, the city may purchase futures contracts and/or options at customer established strike prices and volumes. Such volumes will be delivered to the customer by city under the appropriate rate schedule with a gas charge equal to the agreed upon fixed price. Any penalty charges associated with the failure to properly utilize such volumes shall be borne by the customer. This provision will be administered under a separate contract between customer and city. 
(i)  Continuity of service: The city does not guarantee an uninterrupted or undisturbed supply of natural gas service, and will not be responsible for any loss or damage resulting from the interruption or disturbance for any cause other than gross negligence of the city. The city will not be liable for any loss of profits or other consequential damages resulting from the use of service or any interruption or disturbance of service, and shall not in any way be responsible for transmission, use, or control of natural gas beyond the point of connection to the customer's premises.

All floor drains located in the kitchen/food preparation area, or floor drains within any other area which have the potential to discharge grease, must be plumbed to an outside grease interceptor. Facilities with kitchen/food preparation areas lacking floor drains are required to provide a mop sink plumbed to drain through an approved undersink or in-line grease trap. 
(6)  Location. Each grease interceptor shall be installed and connected so that it is at all times easily accessible for inspection, cleaning, and removal of the intercepted grease. Grease interceptors required under this section shall be installed outdoors of the food service facility. The best location is in an area outside of an exterior wall, but upstream from the domestic wastewater drain line(s). A grease interceptor may not be installed inside any part of a building unless approved in writing by city. The user bears the burden of demonstrating that an outdoor grease interceptor is not feasible. 
(d)  Design criteria. 
(1)  Construction of interceptors. Grease interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with the city plumbing standards and shall meet the minimum requirements of the adopted state and federal codes. Outdoor units shall have a minimum of two (2) compartments with fittings designed for grease retention. All alternative grease removal devices or technologies shall be subject to the written approval of city. Such approval shall be based on demonstrated removal efficiencies of the proposed technology. 
(2)  Access. Outdoor grease interceptors shall be provided with two (2) ductile iron manholes in accordance with ISO 1083. Covers shall be hinged and incorporate a 90-degree blocking system to prevent accidental closure. Covers shall be one-man operable using standard tools and shall be capable of withstanding a test load of one hundred twenty thousand (120,000) pounds. Frames shall be circular with a 24-inch clear opening and shall incorporate a 360-degree, mechanically attached elastomer seating gasket for infiltration control and traffic shock. The hinged box shall include a self-cleaning, dual wiper infiltration plug. The frame's depth shall not exceed four (4) inches, and the flange shall incorporate bedding slots, bolt holes and lifting eyes. All components shall be black coated. Frame weight: seventy-three (73) pounds; cover weight: one hundred twenty-two (122) pounds; total weight: one hundred ninety-five (195) pounds. All grease interceptors shall be designed and installed to allow for complete access for inspection and maintenance of inner chamber(s) as well as viewing and sampling of wastewater discharged to the sanitary sewer. 
(3)  Load-bearing capacity. In areas where additional weight loads may exist, the grease interceptor shall be designed to have adequate load-bearing capacity (example: vehicular traffic in parking or driving areas). 
(4)  Inlet and outlet piping. Wastewater discharging to the grease interceptor shall enter only through the inlet pipe of the interceptor. The inlet pipe bottom tee branch shall extend one (1) foot below liquid level. The outlet pipe bottom tee branch shall be submerged to two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the liquid depth. Each grease interceptor shall have only one (1) inlet and one (1) outlet pipe. 
(5)  Sampling vault. After any interceptor a sampling vault for inspections on the effluent shall be installed. It should contain all the load-bearing capacity as a trap. It shall contain one (1) hinged manhole cover labeled "sewer." 
(6)  Interceptor sizing. 
(i)  Outdoor grease interceptors shall not have a capacity of less than one thousand five hundred (1,500) gallons nor exceed a capacity of three thousand (3,000) gallons. No matter what the calculated capacity using the following formulas, the minimum interceptor size shall be one thousand five hundred (1,500) gallons. If the calculated capacity using one of the following formulas exceeds three thousand (3,000) gallons, then multiple units in series shall be installed. The size of a grease interceptor shall be approximated by the following methods and grease interceptor size shall be the larger of the two (2) results. 
a.  Interceptor capacity (gallons) = (S) × (25) × (Hr/12) 
(S) = Number of seats 
(Hr) = Maximum hours of daily operation (include preparation and cleanup) 
b.  Interceptor capacity (gallons) = (Sum of fixture flows) × (20) 

 
(ii)  Under-sink or in-line grease interceptor requirements shall meet Plumbing and Drainage Institute Standard PDI-G101: 

 
Grease interceptor designs represent minimum standards for normal usage. Installations with heavier usage require more stringent measures for which the user is responsible and shall pay the costs to provide additional measures if required by city. City reserves the right to evaluate interceptor sizing on an individual basis for facilities with special conditions, such as highly variable flows, high levels of grease discharge, or other unusual situations that are not adequately addressed by the formula. 
(e)  Grease interceptor maintenance. 
(1)  Pumping. All grease interceptors shall be maintained by the user at the user's expense. Maintenance shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, and bottom sludges and solids. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the interceptor from which the waste was removed or any other grease interceptor, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed, is strictly prohibited. 
(2)  Pumping frequency. Outdoor grease interceptors must be pumped out completely a minimum of once every three (3) months. Under-sink or in-line grease interceptors must be pumped/cleaned out completely a minimum of once every month. Grease interceptors may need to be pumped more frequently as needed to prevent carry over of grease into the sanitary sewer collection system. In the discretion of the city, pumping frequency may be extended past the minimum period if user can demonstrate that such schedule meets with the intent of this section. 
(3)  Pump out order. When the oil and grease concentrations exceed city maximum discharge limits and/or the combined depth of bottom and top solids exceeds thirty-three (33) percent of the total depth of the trap, city will issue a pump out order to the user. The user shall have seven (7) days from receipt of the order to comply. Where an emergency exists, a written or verbal warning shall be given to the user, and the user will have twenty-four (24) hours to comply. 
(4)  Disposal of interceptor pumped material. All waste removed from each grease interceptor shall be recorded on a proper manifest form. Also, all waste removed from each grease interceptor must be disposed at a facility approved by city to receive such waste in accordance with the provisions of this program. In no way shall the pumped material be returned to any private or public portion of the sanitary sewer collection system. 
(5)  Additives. Any additive(s) placed into the grease interceptor or building discharge line system on a constant, regular, or scheduled basis shall be reported to city. Such additives shall include, but are not limited to commercially available bacteria or other additives designed to absorb, consume, or treat fats, oils, and grease. The use of additives shall in no way be considered as an alternative technology or a substitution for maintenance procedures required herein. 
(6)  Chemical treatment. Chemical treatments such as drain cleaners, enzymes, acids, and other chemicals designed to dissolve, purge, or remove grease shall not be allowed to enter the grease interceptor. 
(f)  Administrative requirements. 
(1)  Initial data acquisition. All food service facilities will be asked to complete a data sheet to establish the grease interceptor database. The city database will be updated with additional or modified information after each yearly inspection. 
(2)  Administrative fees. No fee will be charged for an annual inspection by city. However, if the user's grease interceptor is not in compliance with this section, a fifty-dollar reinspection fee shall be charged for each inspection thereafter until compliance is achieved. 
(3)  Inspection and entry. Authorized personnel of city, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall have the right to enter upon all properties subject to this program, at any time and without prior notification, for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, testing or record review, as part of this program. 
(4)  Record retention and reporting. All users must keep a record of any cleaning or maintenance of their grease interceptor. The following records must be kept on-site at the food service facility for a period of two (2) years: 
(i)  Manifests are required for all grease interceptors and shall contain the following information: 
a.  Food service facility (generator) information, including name, address, volume pumped, date and time of pumping, and generator signature verifying the information; 
b.  Transporter information, including company name, address, license plate number, permit number, driver name, and driver signature verifying transporter information; and 
c.  Receiving information, including facility name, address, date and time of receiving, EPD permit number, and signature verifying receipt of the waste; 
d.  Manifests must be mailed, faxed, or electronically submitted to the grease enforcement coordinator within fourteen (14) days of interceptor maintenance; 
e.  A manifest may not be required for under-sink or inline grease interceptors if user can demonstrate to city a valid reason for such exception. 
(ii)  Maintenance logs are required for all under-sink and in-line interceptors. This log shall include the date, time, amount pumped or cleaned, hauler, disposal site, and signature. Log shall be kept in a conspicuous location for inspection. This log shall be made immediately available to health officer or city representative upon request. 
(g)  Enforcement. The following list is arranged from least severe to most severe: 
(1)  Letter of warning (LW): When the grease enforcement coordinator finds that a user is not in compliance with any provision of this article, the coordinator will serve that user with a written warning describing the noncompliance in detail. 
(2)  Notice of violation (NOV): If the noncompliance issue is not addressed by the user within a three-day period following the letter of warning, a written notice of violation will be issued. According to the severity of the violation the user will be given up to thirty (30) days from receipt of this notice to issue an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required action, shall be submitted by the user to the grease enforcement coordinator. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the grease enforcement coordinator to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.

The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. 
(2)  Upon final determination of costs, fees and expenses incurred in accordance with this chapter, the public officer responsible for enforcement actions in accordance with this chapter shall transmit to the appropriate municipal tax collector or city revenue officer a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties.

Tit. 48, Ch. 4 provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires twelve (12) months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The municipal tax collection or city revenue officer shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the city. 
(3)  Enforcement of liens pursuant to this article may be initiated at any time following receipt by the municipal tax collector or city revenue officer of the final determination of costs in accordance with this article. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this article. 
(4)  The redemption amount of any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this section shall be the full amount of costs as finally determined in accordance with this section together with interest, penalties and costs incurred by the governing authority, municipal tax collector or city revenue officer in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81.

Article I - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 25-10-1. - Short title. 
This chapter shall be known and cited as the "Sign Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 18-04, § 1, 6-26-18) 
Sec. 25-10-2. - Authorization and intent. 
The public has a legitimate interest and concern in the construction, maintenance, and regulation of outdoor advertising within the city and it is therefore desirable to describe the manner of construction, compel the use of safe materials, limit size, height, and location with reference to streets; require clean and sanitary maintenance; and prohibit illegal advertisement pursuant to and in the exercise of the public health, safety and welfare powers of the city. It is the intent of the mayor and council to provide hereby the basis for regulation of such outdoor advertising consistent with the foregoing purposes and thereby regulate such advertising affixed to real property which is visible from any public right-of-way in order to promote public health, safety, traffic safety, welfare, and to protect aesthetic values and qualities in the city. The mayor and council so act, finding and understanding that signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of messages, but that left completely unregulated, signs may also become a threat to public safety as a traffic hazard and detriment to property values and the city's overall public welfare as an aesthetic nuisance. By enacting the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, the mayor and council intend to balance the rights of individuals to convey messages through signs and the rights of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs. 
(Ord. No. 18-04, § 1, 6-26-18) 
Sec. 25-10-3. - Application of regulations. 
(a)  The requirements of this chapter shall govern all signs located within the corporate limits of the city that may be viewed from a public right-of-way, private streets or adjacent property, except as otherwise exempt under this chapter. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to any sign not visible from public or private thoroughfares or adjacent properties. 
(b)  Any area which is annexed into or incorporated within the corporate limits of the city shall, on the effective date of annexation, be subject to all provisions of this chapter. Any such annexed area shall be subject to and be governed by the signage requirements of the use zone within the city which is specified in the ordinance adopted by the mayor and council. 
(c)  The requirements of this chapter shall not apply to canopies, awnings, and marquees that are regulated under sections 25-5-2 and 25-5-3 of the Code of the City of LaGrange, provided such canopies, awnings, and marquees are not used for advertising purposes.

(Ord. No. 18-04, § 1, 6-26-18) 
Sec. 25-10-26. - Changing signs. 
Changing signs or signs employing changing sign technology shall be allowed exclusively within the C-3 zoning district as a portion of a conforming, freestanding sign and are further subject to the following requirements: 
(a)  Each message displayed on any changing sign display shall remain static for at least thirty (30) seconds following the completion of its transition from the previous message. As used in this subsection "static" shall mean a display that is fixed in one (1) position with no portion of the display being in motion or changing in color or light intensity. 
(b)  When a message is changed mechanically, the transition between a complete static display of the previous message and a complete static display of the next message shall be accomplished in three (3) seconds or less. The transition period shall be measured as that period between any movement of any part of the display of the previous message and the time that the display of the next message is fully static. 
(c)  When a message is changed electronically, the transition between a complete static display of the previous message and a complete static display of the next message shall be accomplished in two (2) seconds or less. The transition period shall be measured as that period between the time that the previous message is static and fully illuminated and the next message is static and fully illuminated. 
(d)  No changing sign may include animated, flashing, full-motion video or other intermittent elements. The transition period between two (2) fully illuminated static messages displayed in an electronically changed sign shall not be considered an intermittent element so long as the purpose of the changing light intensity is to fade or dissolve into the next message. 
(e)  No changing sign may have any type of changing effect on the border of the sign that is not fully integrated with a static message display and which does not transition to the next static message display in the same manner as the rest of the display. 
(f)  No display or other effect from any electronically changed sign shall cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle. 
(g)  Message transitions achieved by means of the scrolling of the letters, numbers or symbols shall be completed within two (2) seconds and shall remain static for at least sixty (60) seconds following the completion of the transition from the previous message. 
(h)  All signs shall appropriately adjust display brightness as ambient light levels change so that the brightness of the display does not cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle. The maximum illumination, intensity, or brightness of electronic signs shall not exceed five thousand (5,000) nits (candelas per square meter) during daylight hours, or five hundred (500) nits (candelas per square meter) between dusk to dawn. The sign must have an automatic phased proportional dimmer control, photocell or other light sensing device, or a scheduled dimming timer, or another approved device, which produces a distinct illumination change that reduce nighttime brightness levels (compared to daytime brightness levels). The applicant shall provide written certification from the sign manufacturer that the light intensity has been factory pre-set or can be programmed not to exceed the levels specified in this subsection; end-user manipulation of pre-set levels or to exceed those specifications herein shall not be permitted. Unless another industry standard is accepted, the measurement for purposes of this paragraph shall be at any point ten (10) feet from the surface of the changing sign. 
(i)  No malfunction of a changing sign shall cause a glare or other condition that impairs the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle or which otherwise interferes with the safe operation of a motor vehicle. 
(j)  Any changing sign currently in existence shall comply with the regulations of this part. If a changing sign currently in existence cannot meet these requirements due to the limitation of the technology being employed, the owner of the sign shall be allowed to continue the existing use upon a showing, satisfactory to the director, that the requirements of this part cannot be met. 
(Ord. No. 18-04, § 1, 6-26-18) 
Sec. 25-10-27. - Nonconforming signs. 
Signs that, on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, were approved and legally erected under previous sign restrictions, and have become non-conforming with respect to the requirements of this chapter, may continue in existence subject to the remaining provisions of this section. 
(a)  Signs shall not be repaired, rebuilt, replaced or altered except in conformity with this chapter after damage exceeding fifty (50) percent of the signs' replacement cost at the time of damage. 
(b)  Signs shall not be enlarged or altered in a way that would increase the nonconformity of the sign. 
(c)  Existing signs which were legally erected but which have become non-conforming and which do not meet the setback requirements of this chapter due to road widening should be moved to meet the setback requirement of this chapter but shall not be increased in size, shape or changed in any manner except as to become conforming. 
(d)  A non-conforming sign shall not be replaced by another non-conforming sign, except that the substitution or interchange of poster panels, painted boards or de-mountable material on non-conforming signs shall be permitted. A change in the mode of message conveyance (i.e. from screen-print panel to LED) shall not be permitted on a non-conforming sign. 
(e)  Minor repairs and maintenance of non-conforming signs such as electrical repairs or lettering repair shall be allowed. However, no structural repairs or changes in the size or shape of the signs hall be permitted except to make the sign comply with the requirements of this chapter. 
(f)  Portable signs, banners, and other signs allowed under this chapter which are not fixtures or freestanding signs are considered personal property, unattached to the real property on which they are placed, and thus have no nonconforming or grandfather rights under this section. 
(g)  In all zoning districts, signs shall be removed which: 
(1)  Were illegally erected or maintained with respect to prior ordinances. 
(2)  Are made of paper, cloth or non-durable materials, except as otherwise permitted by this chapter. 
(3)  Are located in the public right-of-way, except as otherwise permitted by this chapter.

(Ord. No. 18-04, § 1, 6-26-18) 
Sec. 25-10-28. - Variances. 
(a)  Application. A request for a variance to the provisions of this chapter may be initiated by a property owner or his authorized agent by filing an application with the community development director. 
(b)  Application requirements. The application shall be on a form provided by the community development department and accompanied by an elevation drawing and/or plot plan, drawn to scale, showing the dimensions and arrangement of the proposed sign. The community development director may require other information about the variance requested and its relationship to the surrounding properties. Variance applications shall be accompanied by a fee as established by the governing body by resolution from time to time. 
(c)  Procedure. Upon the filing of any complete application for a variance, a public hearing shall be scheduled and held by the board of planning and zoning appeals (the board). Public notice of the variance application shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the local jurisdiction at least ten (10) days prior to the scheduled public hearing of the board. Such notice shall state the purpose, location, time and date of the public hearing, and the nature of said application. In addition, at least ten (10) days prior to the scheduled public hearing a sign shall be placed on the property for which a variance is sought. 
(d)  Authority. The board shall have the authority to grant variances to this chapter, upon application by a property owner and after receiving comments by the community development staff and after holding a public hearing. 
(e)  Criteria for action upon variance application. In acting upon variances, the community development staff shall submit written findings and the board shall consider the following criteria and the extent to which they support or fail to support the sign variance application: 
(1)  Where there are unusual, exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions pertaining to the property that do not apply generally to other property in the same vicinity or use district, and such conditions are not the result of the owner's or occupant's own actions. Such conditions may include topography, unique natural conditions, surroundings of the subject property, or the size or peculiar shape of the lot. 
(2)  As a result of such unusual circumstances or conditions, there is an unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty that renders it difficult to carry out the provisions of this chapter. 
(3)  The authorization of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the vicinity or district in which property is located, and the variance will be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the provisions of this chapter. 
(4)  The variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the legal use of the sign. 
(5)  The variance is not a request to permit a type of sign which otherwise is not permitted in the zoning district involved. 
(f)  Appeals. Any applicant aggrieved by the decision of the board shall seek judicial review by filing for a writ of certiorari in the superior court of Troup County within thirty (30) days of the decision.

Buffer means land area which separates land use areas from one another through screening and distance, to shield or block noise, light, glare, visual or other conditions, and/or to minimize physical passage to nonsimilar areas, and/or reduce air pollution, dust, dirt and litter. For the purposes of this chapter, the term buffer shall not include a state waters buffer defined as "the area of land immediately adjacent to the banks of state waters in its natural state of vegetation, which facilitates the protection of water quality and aquatic habitat." 
Caliper means a standard of trunk measurement for replacement trees. Caliper inches are measured at the height of six (6) inches above the ground for trees up to and including four-inch caliper and twelve (12) inches above the ground for trees larger than four (4) inches caliper. If the tree forks between ground level and six (6) inches above ground level, then the tree shall be considered a multi-trunked tree. Caliper for multi-trunked trees shall be determined by measuring each trunk six (6) inches above the fork and calculating the average caliper of the two (2) largest trunks.

Clearing means the removal of vegetation from a property, whether by cutting or other means. 
Critical root zone (CRZ) means the minimum area beneath a tree that must be left undisturbed in order to preserve a sufficient root mass to give the tree a reasonable chance of survival. The CRZ will typically be represented by a concentric circle centering on the tree's trunk with a radius equal in feet to 1.5 times the number of inches of the trunk's diameter. Example: The CRZ radius of a 20-inch diameter tree is thirty (30) feet. 
Development activity means any alteration of the natural environment which requires the approval of a development or site plan and issuance of a development (land disturbance) permit. Development activity shall also include the selective harvest and clear-cutting of trees from undeveloped land incidental to the development of land but shall in no way be related to ongoing forest management practices unrelated to land disturbance. 
Diameter at breast height (DBH) means a standard measure of tree size where the widest cross sectional dimension of a tree trunk is measured at a point four and one-half (4½) feet above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below four and one-half (4½) feet, then the trunk is measured at its most narrow point beneath the split. 
Drip line means a line on the ground established by a vertical plain extending from the tree's outermost branch tips to the ground, i.e., the line enclosing the area directly beneath the tree's crown from which rainfall would drip. 
Grading means the placement, removal, or movement of earth by use of mechanical equipment on a property. 
Ground cover means a category of plants usually ranging from a few inches to a foot or more in height. Some ground covers are excellent for preventing soil erosion; others are helpful in carrying out design patterns. 
Grubbing means the removal of tree stumps and roots. 
Hardwood tree means any tree that is not needle bearing. This definition is based on colloquialism, and does not necessarily reflect any true qualities of the tree.

Mid-canopy tree means a tree that normally attains a height of twenty-five (25) to fifty (50) feet at maturity. 
Non-development activity means any alteration of the natural environment which does not require development or site plan approval, but which would include the proposed removal or destruction of tree(s). 
Outdoor storage means storage out of doors of merchandise in bulk, in shipping containers or packaging, or otherwise not prepared for final sale and delivery. 
Overstory tree means a tree that normally attains a height in excess of fifty (50) feet at maturity. 
Screening means a method of shielding or obscuring one (1) abutting nearby structure or use from another by opaque fencing, walls, berms, densely planted vegetation, or the like. 
Selective harvest means the felling of diseased, defective and/or undesirable trees on a property as a means of improving forest health by insulating remaining desirable trees at a density generally no less than fifty-five (55) tree density units/acre from insect and disease infestations on a property. 
Shrub means a woody plant of relatively low height, typically distinguished from a tree by having several stems rather than a single trunk. 
Softwood tree means any coniferous (cone bearing) tree which bears needle shaped leaves, such as pine, fir, hemlock, cedar, etc. This definition is based on the colloquialism and does not necessarily reflect any true qualities of the tree. 
Specimen tree means any tree which qualifies for special consideration for preservation due to its size, type, and condition as defined in this chapter. 
Structure means anything constructed or erected, the use of which requires a location on the ground, or attached to something having a location on the ground. A single structure encompasses all manmade materials that are tightly integrated to form the whole. 
Timber harvesting means the felling, loading and transporting of timber products (pulpwood, etc.) The term "timber harvesting" may include both clear-cutting and selective harvest of timber or trees. 
Tree means any living, self-supporting woody perennial plant, which normally obtains a trunk diameter at least two (2) inches and a height of at least ten (10) feet, and typically has a main stem or trunk and many branches. 
Tree density standard (TDS) means the minimum number of tree density units per acre which must be achieved on a property after development. 
Tree density unit (TDU) means a credit assigned to a tree, based on the diameter of the tree, in accordance with tables contained in this chapter. 
Tree preservation and/or tree replacement plan (TP/TRP) means a plan that identifies tree protection areas, and shows existing trees to be retained and proposed trees to be planted on a property to meet minimum requirements, as well as methods of tree protection to be undertaken on the site. 
Tree replacement fund means an account of funds contributed by developers as a form of alternative compliance to the requirements of this chapter. 
Tree save area (TSA) means any portion of a site on which trees are proposed to be retained in order to comply with the requirements of this chapter. The tree save area shall include no less than preserving the root system of natural trees and/or preserving natural buffers. 
Tree survey means a site survey and documentation of existing trees within a proposed area to be developed. 
Tree topping means the removal of tree limbs, branches or stems which generally result in the failure of the tree to reassume apical dominance in typical form and with live wood exposed to decaying elements. 
Understory tree means a tree that normally attains a height of less than twenty-five (25) feet at maturity. 
Undisturbed buffer means an area of land on public or private property that has been designated on a plat as a non-disturb buffer, undisturbed buffer, or natural buffer. No disturbance or grading is allowed except for approved perpendicular access and utility crossings. 
Working forest means property of greater than five (5) acres in size that is managed for the production of forest products such as timber or other wood fiber in compliance with Georgia's Best Management Practices for Forestry and often under the guidance of a forest management plan. 
Zoning ordinance means the zoning ordinance as found in this code. The zoning ordinance is amended from time to time by the mayor and the council of the city.

(Ord. No. 14-12, § 1, 10-28-14) 
Sec. 25-11-35. - Timber harvesting; speculative tree removal in anticipation of industrial development. 
(a)  Timber harvesting not incidental to development shall be permitted on any lot within the city subject to the following requirements: 
(1)  A 50-foot buffer of vegetation shall be maintained to no less than fifty-five (55) TDU/acre along all public rights-of-way, except for authorized access crossings, and along all property lines adjoining a residential use. 
(2)  Written notice shall first be filed with the community development department, five (5) days in advance of said harvesting or removal, including a map of the area which identifies the location of the site to be harvested, the main points of ingress and egress and the required buffer. 
(3)  No development of the property shall be permitted that would require the cutting of trees preserved for a period of three (3) years following the timber harvesting. 
(4)  No stump removal or grading is allowed. 
(b)  Speculative tree removal associated with anticipated industrial development shall be approved through the land disturbance permitting process and shall comply with the minimum tree density requirements established in this chapter. Speculative tree removal shall be allowed exclusively in the general industrial zoning district. 
(Ord. No. 14-12, § 1, 10-28-14) 
Sec. 25-11-36. - Minimum tree density requirements. 
(a)  Tree density standards. A basic requirement of this chapter is that all applicable sites, with the exception of sites within the C-2 zoning district, shall maintain or exceed a minimum tree density as follows: 
(1)  New development. 
a.  Commercial, office, institutional and multi-family developments: Six (6) tree density units per acre. 
b.  Single-family and duplex subdivisions: Six (6) tree density units per acre calculated based on the defined limits of construction of roads, utilities, detention ponds, etc. The minimum tree density shall be met in common areas of the subdivision, including, but not limited to, areas such as parks, active and passive recreation areas, and subdivision entrances. 
c.  Industrial developments: Three (3) tree density units per acre. 
d.  Individual single-family and duplex lots: Based on the zoning district where located. Prior to final plat approval, the community development director shall confirm that the trees required by the applicable zoning district have been provided. 
(2)  Redevelopment. Redevelopment of multi-family and nonresidential sites shall require compliance with the tree density standard for new development. For the purposes of this section, redevelopment is defined as one or more of the following: 
a.  Demolition of an existing building and rebuilding on the site; 
b.  Expansion of the gross square feet of the impervious surface on the site by more than fifty (50) percent. 
(3)  Expansions and additions to multi-family and nonresidential sites. When expansion of a site equals no more than fifty (50) percent of the pre-existing impervious surface gross square footage, the tree density standard shall be required and calculated based on the amount of disturbed area for the expansion. Expansion by more than fifty (50) percent of the existing impervious surface gross square feet shall be considered redevelopment and subject to the requirements of subsection (a)(2) above. 
(b)  The term "unit" is not synonymous with "tree." The density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development and may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees in accordance with the minimum standards of this chapter, or some combination of the two (2) as represented by the formula: 
SDF = EDF + RDF 
Where: 
SDF (site density factor) = The minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed site (six (6) units per acre for a commercial, office or residential project; three (3) units per acre for an industrial project). 
EDF (existing density factor) = Density of existing trees to be preserved on a site. 
RDF (replacement density factor) = Density of new trees to be planted on a site. 
(c)  The site density factor (SDF) is calculated by multiplying the number of site acres by six (6) for commercial, office or residential projects or three (3) for industrial projects. 
Example: 
A 3.5 acre commercial site has a SDF of 3.5 X 6 = 21 
(d)  The existing density factor (EDF) is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees to density factor units. This is done using Table A below. Only trees included on the city's approved tree list can be counted in determining the EDF of the site, unless the city authorizes the use of substitute trees subject to the approval of the tree board. 

 
Note: DBH is rounded to the nearest inch (0.5 and higher is rounded up to next inch, 0.4 and lower is rounded down. 
Example: 
A total of 12 trees will remain on the 3.5 acre site. The tree inventory is as follows: 
7—12″ DBH maples 
3—18″ DBH pines 
1—21″ DBH oak 
1—24″ DBH oak 
Converting DBH to density units, the EDF is determined as shown in the following table: 

 
(e)  Calculate the replacement density factor (RDF) by subtracting the EDF from the SDF. 
Example: RDF = 21 - 16.5 = 4.5. 
The density factor credit for each caliper size of replacement (new) trees is shown in Table B. 
Any number or combination of transplantable size trees can be used so long as their total density factor units will equal or exceed the RDF and their species is selected from the city approved tree list. 
If it has been determined by the community development director that the property in question is completely barren of trees and has been for more than ten (10) years (i.e. pasture land), then the unit value for each replacement tree planted will be doubled. 

 
Note: For the purposes of this chapter, tree calipers are measured at one and one-half (1.5) feet above the ground or at any point below that for new trees or multi-trunked species, but in no case less than six (6) inches from the ground. 
(f)  Buffer exclusion. Existing trees proposed to be retained and new trees proposed to be planted in order to meet the buffer requirements of this article or conditions of zoning, special use or variance approval shall not be considered in fulfilling the requirements of this article and do not count towards meeting the tree density requirement. As such, properties containing required buffers may exclude the land area contained in those buffers from the total acreage of the property in calculating the site density factor of this article. 
(g)  Easement exclusion. Properties possessing natural gas, petroleum or electric power transmission easements, or sanitary sewer main (greater than eight (8) inches in diameter) or water main (greater than sixteen (16) inches in diameter) distribution easements, may exclude the land area contained in said easement from the total acreage of the property in fulfilling the tree density standard of this article provided that no improvements (e.g. parking lots, tennis courts, driveways, stormwater detention facilities, etc.) are proposed within the easement. If any improvements are proposed within the easement, then the land area so utilized within the easement for the improvement, plus an additional ten (10) feet of land area surrounding the improvements, shall be used to fulfill the tree density standard of this article. 
(h)  Lake and pond exclusion. Properties with an existing lake or pond may exclude the land area contained in the lake or pond from the total acreage of the property in calculating the site density factor. 
(Ord. No. 14-12, § 1, 10-28-14) 
Sec. 25-11-37. - Specimen trees. 
(a)  Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and encouragement for preservation. These trees are referred to as specimen trees. The following criteria are used by the city to identify specimen trees. Both the size and condition must be met for a tree to qualify. 
(1)  Overstory trees such as oaks hickories, or other large hardwoods, and softwood trees such as pines and cedars, must be at least twenty-four (24) inches in diameter at breast height to be considered a specimen tree. 
(2)  Small native flowering trees must be at least twelve (12) inches in diameter at breast height to be considered a specimen tree. 
(3)  Condition criteria. 
a.  Life expectancy of greater than fifteen (15) years. 
b.  Relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay. 
c.  No major insect or pathological problems. 
d.  No major pruning deficiencies, i.e. topping. 
e.  At least seventy-five (75) percent of the critical root zone in a natural, undisturbed state. 
f.  A species on the city's approved tree list. 
(b)  It is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable efforts shall include, but not be limited to, alternate building design, building location, parking area layout, parking area location, reduction in parking area to the minimum required, water retention location and the like. 
(c)  In order to encourage the preservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, additional density credit will be given for specimen trees which are successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose. Credit for any specimen tree thus saved would be two (2) times the assignment value shown in Table A in section 25-11-36(d). 
(d)  If a specimen tree must be removed, it shall be replaced by a species with potential for comparable size and quality. Species selection is subject to approval of the community development director or city arborist. Tree replacement in recompense for specimen tree removal shall be in addition to the minimum required tree density. 
(e)  Except as exempted, no specimen tree may be removed without prior written approval from the community development director. Any specimen tree which is removed without the appropriate review and approval of the community development director must be replaced by trees with a minimum caliper size of five (5) inches per tree with a total density equal to three (3) times the unit value of the tree removed. In addition, the city may issue a citation for the removal of a specimen tree without the appropriate city review and approval. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval. 
(f)  In the event any specimen tree is damaged during construction or as a result of construction and does not survive more than sixty (60) months following completion of development, the owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees (three-inch minimum caliper) having an inch for inch replacement of the specimen tree removed on the site. 
(g)  The community development director or city arborist may identify and require the preservation of a tree stand if it contains one (1) or more specimen tree and the trees are interlocked with other members of the stand in such a manner as to imperil the individual tree if other members of the stand were to be removed. 
(h)  In order to facilitate specimen tree preservation, a variance to the dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance may be an appropriate remedy to preserve a specimen tree. Where, in the opinion of the community development director, one (1) or more variances would enable a site and building design to be accomplished while saving one (1) or more specimen trees, and where the objectives of tree protection would outweigh the purposes of the zoning regulations that would be varied, the community development director may suggest an applicant apply for variances instead of proposing to remove one (1) or more specimen trees. A determination by the community development director that one (1) or more variances to the dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance would not be appropriate may support a finding by the community development director in favor of granting approval to remove one (1) or more specimen trees. 
(Ord. No. 14-12, § 1, 10-28-14) 
Sec. 25-11-38. - Phased projects. 
Where development is going to occur in increments (by design or by implication), density calculations must be based on a site area defined by an established or estimated phase line and existing trees to be counted toward meeting the density requirements should be within the phase line. 
(Ord. No. 14-12, § 1, 10-28-14) 
Sec. 25-11-39. - Standards for tree protection during construction. 
In the tree save area, protective measures shall be applied to the aboveground portion of a tree and to roots within the critical root zone, as follows: 
(1)  Damage prohibited. No person shall: 
a.  Cut, carve, transplant, or otherwise damage or remove any tree; 
b.  Attach any rope, wire, nails, advertising posters, or other contrivance to any trees; 
c.  Allow any gaseous, liquid or solid substance which is harmful to trees (such as concrete washout, fuels, lubricants, herbicides, paint, etc.) to come in contact with them; or 
d.  Set a fire or permit any fire to burn when such fire or the heat of the fire will injure any portion of any tree. 
(2)  Fence required. During excavation, filling, construction or demolition operations, each tree or stand of trees shall be protected against damage to bark, roots and low-hanging branches with a fence enclosing the critical root zone (four (4) feet high, two-inch by four-inch posts; with double one-inch by four-inch rails, plastic construction area fencing, or 12-gauge two-inch by four-inch wire mesh). "Tree save area" signs shall be posted on all sides of the fenced area. All tree protection fencing shall be installed prior to any clearing, grubbing or grading. Tree protection must remain in functioning condition until the certificate of occupancy is issued. Failure to comply with and/or maintain approved tree protection measures may result in a stop work order issued by the community development department. 
(3)  Compaction prohibited. All building materials, vehicles, construction equipment, dirt, debris or other objects likely to cause soil compaction or aboveground damage shall be kept outside the critical root zone. Where a limited amount of encroachment is unavoidable and is approved by the building official, the critical root zone shall first be mulched with a four-inch layer of processed pine bark or wood chips or a six-inch layer of pine straw. 
(4)  Grade changes prohibited. There shall be no raising or lowering of the ground level within the critical root zone. Stripping of topsoil in the critical root zone shall not be permitted. Where necessary the use of moderate fill is permitted only with prior installation of an aeration system approved by the building official. Deposition of sediment in the critical root zone shall be prevented by placement of sediment barriers, which shall be backed by two-inch by four-inch wire mesh. 
(5)  Ditches, trenches prohibited. No person shall excavate any ditch, tunnel or trench within the critical root zone. Where such encroachment is unavoidable and is approved by the building official, tunneling rather than trenching shall be used. For installation of underground irrigation, radial trenching may be permitted. 
(6)  Paving prohibited. No person shall pave with concrete, asphalt or other impervious material within the critical root zone. 
(Ord. No. 14-12, § 1, 10-28-14)

(Ord. No. 14-12, § 1, 10-28-14) 
Sec. 25-11-55. - Buffers. 
(a)  Generally. Buffers shall be required along side and rear property lines which separate uncomplimentary uses in accordance with the table below or as a condition of zoning, special use, or variance approval. Buffers are intended to eliminate or minimize potential nuisances such as dirt, litter, noise, glare of lights, signs, and unsightly buildings or parking areas. Where noted for one- and two-family residential districts, the buffer requirement applies at the time of subdivision platting. If a buffer was not required at the time of subdivision platting, existing platted individual one- and two-family residential lots are not required to provide a buffer. 
(b)  Undisturbed buffers. Where required, undisturbed buffers must remain undisturbed and actively protected in perpetuity. Existing vegetation shall be used to meet the buffer requirement if it provides the same level of obscurity as the planted buffer requirements of this section. When existing vegetation is sparse, supplemental plantings may be required to provide a one hundred (100) percent opaque year-round visual screen. 
(c)  Minimum required buffers. Buffers shall be required according to the following table: 

 
*MHP developments shall comply with section 25-35-70(g) of this Code. 
(d)  Planted buffer types defined. There shall be four (4) different buffer types as follows: 

 
(e)  Planted buffer standards. 
(1)  Required buffer plantings allow for a mix of overstory, mid-canopy, understory and evergreen trees, and large shrubs which are adaptable to the region. The mix is designed to create a buffer which will give a satisfactory screen at least six (6) feet in height within two (2) to three (3) years of planting, under normal maintenance, while allowing room for the various plants to grow. 
(2)  Deciduous trees shall be at least eight (8) feet tall and a minimum caliper of two (2) inches at planting. Understory trees are required to fulfill between no less than twenty (20) percent and no more than thirty (30) percent of the required number of trees. Additionally, evergreen trees are required to fulfill at least fifty (50) percent of the required trees planted in buffers, shall be at least six (6) feet tall at planting, and shall be a species which will achieve a height of at least twenty (20) feet at maturity. Trees shall be distributed along the entire length of the buffer. 
(3)  Shrubs shall be a minimum of three (3) feet in height at the time of planting and shall be a species that will achieve a height of at least ten (10) feet at maturity. Shrubs shall be planted not closer than six (6) feet on center, not closer than six (6) feet to planted trees, and not within the drip line of existing trees. Shrubs shall be distributed along the entire length of the buffer. 
(4)  Buffer plantings shall be guaranteed for the lifetime of the development. Necessary trimming and maintenance shall be performed by the owner of the property on which the buffer is planted to maintain the health of the plant materials, to provide an aesthetically pleasing appearance, and to ensure that the buffer serves the purpose for which it is intended. 
(5)  Trees planted to meet the buffer requirements shall be selected from those noted in section 25-11-43 as suitable for buffer planting. Trees shall be varied so that no one (1) species makes up more than thirty-three (33) percent of the trees planted in the required buffer. 
(6)  Shrubs planted to meet the buffer requirement shall be selected from the following list: 
Southern Wax Myrtle (Myrica cerifera)* — Evergreen; 
Mountain-Laurel (Kalmia latifolia)* — Evergreen; 
Piedmont Rhododendron (Rhododendron minus)* — Evergreen; 
Crape Myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica) — Deciduous; 
Japanese Camellia (Camellia japonica) — Evergreen; 
Sasanqua Camellia (Camellia sasanqua) — Evergreen; 
Oaklfeaf Hydrangea (Hydrangea quercifolia)* — Deciduous; 
Yaupon Holly (Ilex Vomitoria) — Evergreen; 
* Shrubs noted with an asterisk are desirable natives. 
(f)  Structural buffers. 
(1)  Non-vegetative materials utilized to satisfy the screening requirement of this article, in addition to the use of existing vegetation and/or supplemental plantings, may consist of walls, fences, earthen berms or any combination thereof. 
(2)  If walls or fences are to be utilized, their placement and installation shall be such so as to cause minimal disturbance of existing vegetation and located so as to provide an effective visual screen. 
(3)  Non-vegetative screenings do not take the place of required vegetative buffers, but are only intended to supplement planted buffers. Vegetative material shall be provided between the non-vegetative screen and the adjacent property. 
(4)  Non-vegetative materials shall be maintained by the owner of the property where the buffer is located. Fences used in buffers must be made of rot-resistant material or protected from deterioration with water-proofing material. The following fence and wall materials are permitted for use in a required buffer: wood, brick, stone, wrought iron, iron, and powder coated aluminum. 
(g)  Disturbance or encroachments. 
(1)  Buffers shall contain no driveways, parking areas, patios, storm water detention facilities, or any other structure or accessory uses except for approved structural buffers. 
(2)  Underground utilities may be permitted to cross a buffer if the screening standards of this article will be subsequently achieved to the satisfaction of the community development director. 
(3)  Supplemental plantings or re-plantings, or authorized structural buffer devices shall be authorized to encroach into a buffer provided there is minimal disturbance of any significant existing vegetation. 
(4)  Land disturbance is authorized in areas of a buffer that are devoid of significant vegetation provided that the final grade and re-plantings of vegetation meet the screening requirements contained herein. 
(5)  Dying, diseased, noxious (including non-native, invasive vegetation), or dead vegetation may be removed from a buffer provided minimal disturbance occurs and written authorization has been given by the community development director or his designee. Vegetation thus removed shall be replaced where necessary to meet the screening requirements contained herein. 
(h)  Protection during land-disturbing activities. During authorized land-disturbing activities, buffers shall be clearly demarcated and protected prior to commencement of, and during, construction in accordance with the approved tree preservation plan. 
(i)  Modification or waiver. The board of planning and zoning appeals may modify or waive the buffer requirements when it can be demonstrated by the property owner that the specific buffer is not needed for the protection of surrounding areas because of intervening streets, roadways, drainage ways, or other factors such as natural growth of sufficient height and density to serve the same purpose as the required screening buffer.

(d)  Maintenance inspection. Two years after the installation of required landscaping, the city shall conduct a maintenance inspection. Trees preserved to meet the required tree density standard which are dead or near death at the time of the maintenance inspection must be replaced if there is evidence that the demise of such trees was due to construction injury. Any trees planted to meet the required site density factor which are dead or near death must be replaced. Trees required to be replaced by this inspection must be planted within thirty (30) days of receipt of notification by the current owner(s). 
(Ord. No. 14-12, § 1, 10-28-14) 
Sec. 25-11-69. - Performance security. 
When planting stock availability is low or weather conditions are not appropriate for planting new trees, the project owner may postpone planting for up to six months, provided that performance security is posted with the City of LaGrange in accordance with the following criteria: 
(1)  Security shall be in an approved form submitted to the community development department with appropriate documentation of stock availability and weather conditions. 
(2)  Security shall be in an amount equal to one hundred ten (110) percent of the cost of materials, installation, and guarantee, as demonstrated by a signed contract between the owner and a landscape contractor and approval by department of planning and community development.

(Ord. No. 14-12, § 1, 10-28-14) 
Sec. 25-11-71. - Alternative compliance. 
(a)  The intent of this chapter is to insure that a minimum density of trees is maintained on all developed sites with the exception of an individual single-family residential or duplex lot. Occasionally, this intent cannot be met because a project site will not bear the required density of trees. In this case, the community development director may approve a contribution to the city's tree replacement fund. 
(b)  The following standards have been established for administering these contributions: 
(1)  The community development director must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. 
(2)  In no instance shall more than seventy-five (75) percent of the required site density be met through alternative compliance. 
(3)  As many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site in question. This may require planting fewer trees of a larger caliper than the minimum required caliper. 
(4)  No permit shall be issued until the required contribution has been made to the tree replacement fund. 
(5)  The amount of the contribution shall be determined from the fee schedule for the community development department as may be amended from time to time by the mayor and council.

(1)  Master plan roads. Subdivision plats shall include roads and streets shown on the transportation element of the master plan of streets and highways or parts of such adopted plans, or in accordance with the plans of the state highway administration as to state roads and access thereto. Any such streets, roads or highways shown must include either full width dedication of right-of-way or, if authorized by the DRP, a recordable agreement to dedicate at no cost to the public.

(3)  Future subdivisions. A tract proposed for subdivision into parcels larger than normal building plots intended for future subdivision rather than immediate development shall be divided so as to allow for future opening of streets and such further logical subdivisions as can be foreseen. 
(4)  Residential secondary streets. Residential secondary streets shall be planned to discourage their use by non-local traffic. 
(5)  Alleys. Alleys shall be provided along the rear of all lots to be used for business. Provisions for alleys along the rear of residential lots is encouraged, except where, in the opinion of the DRP, such alleys are not required. The use of alleys will be assessed by the DRP in conjunction with the applicable thoroughfare design standards during the application review process. The DRP reserves the right to require that alleys be developed and maintained as private property that the developer provide a method and/or structure to finance the maintenance of alleys. All private alleys shall include a municipal easement giving the right of passage for the delivery of service, the right to install, operate and maintain water, gas, electric, and telecommunications and stormwater management facilities in the alleyway. 
(6)  Major street. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major street, access to such street shall be a primary consideration and the DRP may require either of several provisions for that access, such as: (1) parallel streets with lots backing to the streets, where appropriate, together with screen planting strips contained in a non-access easement along the rear lot lines; (2) parallel streets with short cul-de-sac having terminal lots backing to the major street, or such other treatments as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
(7)  Private residential streets. Private residential streets are generally discouraged. If absolutely necessary in a subdivision, they shall be built to structural standards of a tertiary road. 
(8)  Railroad crossings. A subdivision plat involving new or existing streets crossing railroad tracks shall provide adequate right-of-way, including approach right-of-way and slope easements for construction of underpass or overpass unless otherwise determined by the DRP. 
(9)  Dead end streets. Dead end streets (cul-de-sacs) are discouraged and are considered detrimental to the general good of the community. However, short cul-de-sacs of less than two hundred fifty (250) feet in total length may be approved by the DRP provided that said cul-de-sac does not discharge traffic to a major thoroughfare or collector street, as such are defined within the thoroughfare design standards. Cul-de-sac squares (a planted area around which traffic can circle) may be mandated by the DRP when dead end streets are authorized by the DRP. The DRP shall have the right to require the dedication of adequately sized right-of-way to facilitate connection to adjoining property and/or future streets.

Sec. 25-20-81. - Site development standards. 
This section sets forth development standards to address the physical and technical conditions unique to hillside and ridgeline property. In case of conflict between the provisions of this subsection and those of any other portion of the City Code, the provisions of this section shall prevail unless otherwise determined by the community development director. 
(1)  The character and profile of the hillside shall be preserved by using existing disturbed areas for building envelopes rather than undisturbed areas. 
(2)  Stable and sufficiently usable areas of land for development shall be provided for each lot. 
(3)  Split-pad and stepped foundations shall be used where appropriate. 
(4)  The use of basements, decks and small patios shall be encouraged to reduce the amount of grading. 
(5)  Structures shall be designed to blend into the natural character of the hillside by reducing the visual bulk through landscaping, terraced building forms and height variations. 
(6)  A series of smaller, visually distinct roofs, specifically pitched, gabled and hipped roofs, shall be encouraged to reflect the visual diversity of the natural hillsides. 
(7)  Cut or fill slopes shall be designed such that they are visible from the residence on the property in which they are located. This will encourage property owners to stabilize, maintain and treat slopes to prevent erosion. 
(8)  Building envelopes, disturbed areas and areas to remain undisturbed for each created lot shall be shown on the preliminary and final plats. 
(9)  Safe and adequate access from public streets without requiring massive grading or substantial vegetation removal shall be required for each created lot. 
(10)  The maximum slope on any driveway portion shall be ten (10) percent. 
(11)  The following standards are intended to minimize the visual effect of excessive fencing and retaining walls in hillside and ridgeline development: 
a.  Multiple retaining walls shall be separated horizontally by a distance equal to at least the height of the lower retaining wall and include appropriate landscaping between walls and; 
b.  A series of smaller retaining walls shall be encouraged rather than one large, uninterrupted wall. 
(Ord. No. 14-07, § 1, 5-13-14) 
Sec. 25-20-82. - Grading standards. 
The following standards are intended to preserve the natural topographic features, foster resource preservation and minimize degradation of the visual character of hillsides: 
(1)  Grading shall relate to the natural topography with the natural topography maintained to the greatest extent possible. Mass grading in areas of thirty-five (35) percent or greater slope shall be avoided unless associated with necessary access or utilities as approved by the community development director; 
(2)  Where alteration to the natural topography is necessary, it shall be contoured to provide a smooth and gradual transition of grading and natural slopes, while maintaining the basic character of the terrain; 
(3)  Repetitive padding or terracing of a series of lots ("stair stepping" up a slope) shall not be permitted. Creation of a single large pad or terrace (especially creating a single pad or terrace for an entire lot) shall be an exception to typical design to deal with circumstances that cannot be managed with other techniques. Typical design shall utilize full split pads (separate level for a down-slope lower story), a split foundation (adapting a single story to a slope), setting the building into a cut in the hillside, or a combination of techniques. 
(4)  Cut and fill slopes shall be no more than one and one-half (1½) times natural grade (e.g. increased from ten (10) percent to fifteen (15) percent) and shall be no steeper than 3:1 (thirty-three (33) percent). 
(5)  Grading shall create varying gradients and smooth transitions between the gradients in order to avoid a "manufactured" appearance. 
(Ord. No. 14-07, § 1, 5-13-14) 
Sec. 25-20-83. - Vegetation preservation and planting standards. 
This section sets forth development standards to ensure maximum preservation and restoration of existing trees and vegetation on hillsides and ridgelines, reduce damage from sediment and runoff, improve wildlife habitat, and retain the desirable qualities of hillsides. 
(1)  Existing native trees and vegetation shall be retained and integrated into the site development plan to the maximum extent feasible so as to maintain the natural surface drainage system, protect and preserve ecological communities, and enhance the natural scenic and visual quality. 
(2)  Where existing trees or plants have been removed from hillside or ridgeline properties, the following standards apply: 
a.  Existing vegetation shall not be destroyed, removed or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days before grading is scheduled to begin; and 
b.  All graded or disturbed area, exposed slopes and areas of soil or land from disturbance not designated for development shall be re-vegetated and replanted immediately after grading in order to mitigate adverse visual impacts, improve soil conditions, minimize erosion and stabilize necessary cut and fill slopes with plant roots. 
(3)  Man-made slopes, other than dam slopes, that are steeper than 4:1, more than eight (8) feet in height and twenty (20) feet in length (in plan view) shall be planted with trees. Trees shall be selected from the city approved tree list and shall be planted at a rate of one (1) tree for every six hundred (600) square feet of slope area. These trees shall be planted in a natural design (i.e. not in a row, but clumped and staggered), shall be a mixture of two-inch, three-inch and four-inch caliper trees and shall be in addition to other provisions for trees as required elsewhere in the City Code.

(Ord. No. 12-12, § 1, 6-26-12) 
Sec. 25-25-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of LaGrange, Georgia, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 12-12, § 1, 6-26-12) 
Sec. 25-25-3. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed walls of a building.

Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two (2) or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure prior to the start of construction of the improvement. Note: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Sec. 25-25-23. - Procedure. 
(a)  The construction board of appeals as established by the City of LaGrange shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the building official in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the construction board of appeals may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Troup County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the construction board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 12-12, § 1, 6-26-12) 
Sec. 25-25-24. - Conditions for variances. 
(a)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
(1)  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
(2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and 
(3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(b)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(c)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(d)  The building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(1)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the construction board of appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

(1)  When required by the department of community development, provide a soils investigation for all sites proposed as ponds or impoundments or for stormwater detention/retention. Locate all soil borings on the site plan. 
(2)  Provide a construction schedule for both temporary and permanent facilities. Reference the schedule to other development activities such as clearing, rough grading, construction, final grading, and vegetation establishment. 
(3)  Provide a cost estimate for construction of stormwater management facilities. Provide a separate estimate of the annual cost for maintenance of the proposed facilities. 
(4)  Joint construction. Upon written request by the developer, the city staff shall determine if the development and construction projects in an area are small enough, or that engineering and economic factors make offsite retention or other drainage facilities more practical, and may authorize the joint construction of these facilities to serve two (2) or more properties by two (2) or more developers. Where offsite stormwater facilities serving two (2) or more properties are approved for construction, no use of land or occupancy of buildings within the properties served by these facilities shall be permitted until completion of the retention and drainage structures, except upon approval by the department of community development. 
(5)  Temporary storage of runoff. The following requirements shall apply to the installation, development and maintenance of all detention facilities designed for temporary storage of stormwater runoff: 
a.  Permanent fencing at least six (6) feet in height shall be required around all detention facilities. This fencing shall be designed, installed and maintained to allow the freeflow of runoff and sediment into the facility. The fence shall include a gate of sufficient size to permit entrance of equipment necessary to allow periodic maintenance activities. 
b.  Facilities shall be located on tracts of land with sufficient area around the perimeter to provide access for maintenance purposes. The access for maintenance shall provide at least ten (10) feet of width clearance from above ground obstructions including trees, headwalls, weirs, or other structures. 
(b)  Post-development stormwater management performance criteria. The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this chapter: 
(1)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
a.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
b.  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and 
c.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
(2)  Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three (3) approaches: 
a.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer; 
b.  Twenty-four-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event; this requirement may be adjusted or waived by the city for sites that discharge directly into larger streams, rivers, wetlands, or lakes, or to a manmade channel or conveyance system where the reduction in these flows will not have an impact on upstream or downstream streambank or channel integrity. 
c.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
(3)  Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the twenty-five-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, twenty-four-hour storm under subsection 25-29-4(b)(2)b. is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the twenty-five-year return frequency storm event must be provided. This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the city for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
(4)  Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the city for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
(5)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the city before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. 
Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
(6)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one (1) or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection 25-29-4(b)(1) The applicant may, if approved by the city, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
(7)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public right-of-ways. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more that one (1) parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements: 
a.  Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual; 
b.  All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and

(Ord. No. 17-06, § 1, 5-23-17) 
Sec. 25-30-4. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the chapter and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this code section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this chapter and the NPDES general permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this code section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to Code section 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this Code section; 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraphs (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year-round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; 
(16)  There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(17)  There is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a twenty-five-foot buffer would consume at least eighteen (18) percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than five hundred (500) square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in [EPD Rule] 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than five thousand (5,000) square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least fourteen (14) days prior to the commencement of land-disturbing activities. 
(d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this code section. 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 17-06, § 1, 5-23-17) 
Sec. 25-30-5. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of LaGrange without first obtaining a permit from the city to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the department of community development and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this code section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this code section will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three (3) copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
(3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan.

Project site: That portion of the property including but not limited to the grading, landscaping, buildings or structures and any other improvements to the site. 
Screening: Structure or planting that conceals from view the area behind such structure or planting. 
Underlying zone: The designated zoning districts which are established on the official zoning map. Regulations of these zoning districts may be supplemented, but not changed, when an "overlay zone" is applied to these zoning districts. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of the P-1 parkway zone is to provide for a superior environment along major transportation corridors through the application of an overlay zone. The overlay zone regulations are intended to supplement the regulations of the underlying zone districts and to provide for harmony and compatibility of development over the length of the corridor. This zone is established to protect the public investment in major highways and ensure that these can continue to serve their primary functions of moving volumes of traffic safely. Provisions of the park way zone are intended to expedite the free flow of traffic and reduce the hazards arising from unnecessary points of ingress and egress and cluttered roadside development. The district is intended to enhance the value of adjacent lands by preserving and extending the useful life of the highway, avoiding land uses that conflict with the roadside and the surrounding area and reducing the risks of creating blighted areas. Insuring the attractiveness of roadside uses will contribute to and enhance trade, tourism, capital investment and the general welfare. 
(c)  Regulations of underlying district. Unless otherwise noted in the parkway zone regulations, the regulations of the underlying zoning district shall be maintained and not affected. 
(d)  Establishment of districts. Parkway district boundaries shall be established and from time to time amended on the official zoning map, and may include any highway which is deemed appropriate and its adjacent properties to a specified distance from the centerline of the highway. The mayor and council may apply the parkway zone to any highway corridor upon concluding that: 
(1)  The highway corridor has scenic qualities and natural beauty that should be protected; 
(2)  A major purpose of the highway is to carry through traffic; and 
(3)  Development along the highway in the absence of the parkway zoning provisions could have an adverse impact on its level of service; increase danger and/or congestion in the street; impair the public health, safety, convenience and welfare; and/or impede the maintenance or creation of a convenient, attractive and harmonious community. 
(e)  Conditions. All uses under this section are subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  A site plan is required to be submitted for review and approval for the development of any parcel within the parkway district. The site plan review procedure shall be carried out in accordance with the site plan review ordinance of the city. A site plan shall be submitted and approved prior to any site preparation. 
(2)  The minimum distance between all driveways, curb cuts or access points of any kind onto a service road, frontage road or unified access road to the main highway shall be approved by the state department of transportation. All such entrances shall be constructed of materials that will eliminate the potential for soil and mud to be tracked onto the parkway. 
(3)  No loading or unloading of material shall take place in any front or corner side yard of any parcel which fronts on the highway right-of-way. Buildings will be designed so as to provide service entrances at the rear. 
(4)  No parking shall be permitted on the highway right-of-way. All parcels shall be expected to provide sufficient off-street parking to meet their individual needs. 
(5)  For every four (4) rows of parking spaces delineated, one (1) raised parking island shall be provided, thereby creating separated parking areas to aid in safe and orderly use of the lot and confine vehicular movement to marked drives. Raised or curbed circulation islands shall be constructed at the ends of the rows of parking spaces or at other locations where circulation drives intersect. For all uses providing clientele parking, all circulation drives shall be clearly defined and marked appropriately with arrows and the like to assist public circulation into, on and out of the property and through parking lot areas. 
(6)  Adequate circulation drives shall interconnect all lot access points with all vehicle parking, loading, servicing and like areas and structures, thereby creating an on-site circulation network which, together with any service drives abutting the lot, will provide a safe and convenient means for lot servicing and fire protection. 
(7)  Circulation drives used by vehicles to reach a drive-by sales or service window, depository or similar facility shall be one-way and shall be of sufficient length to prevent a line of waiting vehicles from backing up into a street or onto adjoining property. 
(f)  Use limitations. Land within the parkway zone may be used as permitted in the underlying district in which located, subject to the above conditions and with the following: 
(1)  Junkyards are prohibited. 
(2)  Individual manufactured homes and manufactured home parks shall be prohibited. 
(3)  Sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are prohibited. 
(4)  Any commercial development shall be subject to the following: 
a.  Coordination of pedestrian and vehicular circulation patterns shall be encouraged between adjacent property owners. 
b.  Such use shall have access designed so as not to impede traffic on a public street intended to carry through traffic. To such end, access via the following means shall be given favorable consideration in site plan review: 
1.  Access to the site is provided by a public street other than one intended to carry through traffic; and/or 
2.  Access to the site is provided by a functional frontage road, service drive or joint driveway which provides controlled access to the site and/or to several adjacent sites; and/or 
3.  Acceleration/deceleration lanes, turning lanes and/or stacking lanes are provided to improve access to the site and/or several adjacent sites. 
c.  All areas subject to vehicular traffic including frontage roads, accessways, loading areas and service areas shall be constructed in accordance with the minimum paving specifications in force in the city at the time of improvement. 
d.  All commercial uses shall provide at least one (1) regular sized garbage container outside of the establishment, adequately screened from the view of the highway. 
e.  All commercial uses shall provide and maintain a landscaped area along the length of their frontage with the highway or service road right-of-way as may be reasonably necessary. 
(g)  Overall landscaping requirements. 
(1)  Any part of the project site not used for buildings or other structures shall be landscaped in an amount equal to ten (10) percent of the vehicular use area. (Vehicular use area includes parking lots, accessways, loading area and service areas.) 
Landscaped islands can count toward overall landscaping requirements; however, only trees and shrubs shall be considered as landscaping elements. 
Landscaping shall include a minimum of one (1) tree for each five hundred (500) square feet of landscaped area. Each tree shall have a caliper of two (2) inches at time of planting. 
(2)  Existing vegetation which meets the requirements of this section should be used as required planting, where practical. 
(3)  All required planting shall be maintained in a healthy and productive condition. 
(h)  Signs. Signs shall be allowed only in accordance with the applicable provisions of chapter 25-10 (Signs) of this Code.

Sec. 25-35-74. - MXD zone, mixed use development. 
(1)  Purpose and objectives of zone. It is the objective of this zone to establish procedures and standards for the implementation of comprehensively planned, multi-use projects. It is also intended that this zone provide a more flexible approach to the comprehensive design and development of multi-use projects than the procedures and regulations applicable under the various conventional zoning categories. In so doing, it is intended that this zoning category be utilized to foster an overall improved development pattern that emulates the early twentieth century development pattern of LaGrange, which is still found within the historic areas of the city. The specific purposes of the zone are: 
(a)  To encourage orderly, staged development of comprehensively planned, multi-use centers by providing procedures for various zoning and plan approvals, including development phasing; 
(b)  To encourage design flexibility and coordination of architectural style of buildings and signage; 
(c)  To ensure the integration and internal compatibility of applicable residential and nonresidential uses by providing a suitable residential environment that is enhanced and complimented by commercial, recreational, open space, employment and institutional uses and amenities within all land use components of the multi-use project; 
(d)  To ensure compatibility of the proposed land uses with internal and surrounding uses by incorporating higher standards of land planning and site design than could be accomplished under conventional zoning categories and to provide a superior quality of development exceeding that which could be achieved under conventional zoning regulations and procedures; 
(e)  To encourage the efficient use of land by: locating employment and retail uses convenient to residential areas; reducing reliance on automobile use and encouraging pedestrian and other non-vehicular circulations systems; retaining and providing usable open space and active recreation areas close to employment and residential population; and providing for the development of comprehensive non-vehicular circulation networks, separated from vehicular roadways, which constitute a system of linkages among residential areas, open spaces, recreational areas, commercial and employment areas, and public facilities; 
(f)  To provide a superior natural environment by the preservation of trees, natural topographic geologic features, wetlands, watercourses, and open space; and 
(g)  To allow development only in a staged or phased fashion to ensure the adequacy for the provision of public facilities and the concurrent implementation of community amenities. 
The MXD zoning classification and accompanying development plans may be approved upon findings that the application is proper for the comprehensive and systematic development of the city, is capable of accomplishing the purposes of this zone, is an internally and externally compatible form of development and is consistent with any applicable planning and land use policies of the city. In order to enable the city to evaluate the conformance with the standards contained herein, specific sets of plans shall be submitted in accord with subsection (8) herein, and the city is authorized to approve said plan or plans if such plans are found sufficient to accomplish the above purposes in compliance with the standards and requirements of this zone. 
(2)  Minimum size, location, and development requirements. 
(a)  Minimum area. No land shall be classified in the MXD zone unless it contains a minimum of four (4) acres. Parcels or tracts less than the minimum acreage may be permitted if they are contiguous to an existing MXD zoned area and may be harmoniously integrated into the MXD area, consistent with the objectives and purposes of this zone. 
(b)  Location. Such land shall be located adjacent to and readily accessible from existing or planned roadways that are in an approved construction program and are adequate to service the proposed development. It is intended that adequate access be available to such sites so that traffic does not have an adverse impact on the surrounding area or cause internal circulation or safety problems. 
(c)  Public water and sewer. No development shall be permitted unless served by public water and sewer. 
(d)  Signage. Signs shall be allowed in accordance with the specifications and standards established in the final site plan. 
(e)  Frontage on public streets. Anything to the contrary notwithstanding in any regulation in this Code, lots in this zone shall not be required to have direct access to a public street provided that such condition will promote the creation of affordable housing, or will be designed in such a way as to foster the purposes and objectives of this zone, provided that satisfactory access to a public street is provided over private rights-of-way. 
(f)  Connectivity. Parcels shall not be zoned MXD unless configured to connect to adjacent streets and promote the overall connectivity and increased circulation of pedestrians and vehicles within the city. 
(g)  Revitalization. Parcels of land that are currently developed and in need of revitalization due to the existence of under utilized land or buildings, and dilapidated homes and commercial buildings, should be strongly considered for the MXD zone in order to foster redevelopment and revitalization of the said parcels or areas of the city. 
(h)  Large undeveloped land tracts. Large undeveloped land tracts within the city or land that could be reasonably annexed into the city shall be considered for the MXD zone in order for the city to be planed in a more comprehensive and less piecemeal manner. Large tracts of land should be zoned MXD to include a mix of land uses instead of being developed under one conventional zoning category in order to meet the purposes and objectives of this zone. 
(i)  Traditional neighborhood development principles. Land developed in the MXD zone should be developed consistent with the principles of traditional neighborhood developments, which emulate the historic pattern of development in the city and will be generally more compatible with existing developed areas of the city. These principles are listed below: 
1.  Walkability: Most daily needs can be satisfied within a five- to ten-minute walk of home and work (quarter- to half-mile radius). Pedestrian-friendly street design includes buildings close to the street, front porches, continuous tree cover, on-street parking, hidden parking lots, garages relegated to a rear lane, and narrow, slow-speed vehicular trajectories. 
2.  Connectivity: An interconnected street grid network disperses traffic and increases walkability by allowing most streets to be narrow. A high quality pedestrian network and public realm makes walking comfortable, pleasant, and interesting. 
3.  Mixed-use: A mix of shops, offices, apartments, houses, recreation, and institutional uses on site. Mixed-use within the neighborhood, within the block, and within buildings. 
4.  Diverse housing: A range of types, tenures, sizes, and prices located in close proximity. 
5.  High-quality architecture and urban design: Emphasis on aesthetics, human comfort, and creating a sense of place. Special placement of civic buildings and sites within the community. Human-scale architecture and beautiful surroundings to nourish the spirit. 
6.  Traditional neighborhood structure: Discernable center and edge. Limited size of a maximum of one (1) mile across. 
7.  Increased density: More buildings, residences, shops, and services closer together, to encourage walking and to enable a more efficient use of resources and time. 
8.  Smart transportation: A transportation network connecting neighborhoods, business districts, cities and towns together. Pedestrian-friendly design encourages a greater use of walking, bicycles, roller-blades, and scooters as daily transportation. 
9.  Sustainable: Minimal environmental impact of development and its operations. Less use of finite land and fuel resources, more local production. 
10.  Quality of life: Taken together, all of the above contribute to an improved quality of life for community residents and for the human community as a whole. 
(3)  Uses permitted. 
(a)  Residential. All types of residential uses allowed by right or by special exception in all residential zoning districts shall be permitted, as well as accessory uses thereto. 
1.  The location and type of all residential uses proposed on the site must be shown on the plan submitted in accordance with the requirements of subsection (8) of this section, with the level of specificity increasing at each level of plan review. 
2.  Residential uses may be mixed with proposed commercial/industrial/employment uses, rather than located in a separate residential area on the site, upon a finding by the city council that combining residential and non-residential uses at one location, within a site, will not adversely affect the overall development proposed. 
3.  A lot intended for use for a single-family detached dwelling unit may contain both a principle dwelling unit and an urban cottage under the following restrictions and conditions: 
a.  Maximum floor area of an urban cottage shall be nine hundred (900) square feet of heated, interior space in size.

Vehicles parked for indefinite periods of time and not regularly used in the course of business that contain identifying information about a business shall be considered portable signs. 
Wall signs means single-sided signs with one (1) visible face applied to or mounted to the wall or surface of a building or structure, the display surface of which if attached to a wall or portico does not project more than fourteen (14) inches from the outside wall of such building or structure, or if on an awning, canopy or marquee, is flush with the material of said awning, canopy or marquee. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of the Pegasus Parkway Corridor Overlay is to ensure the functionality of the roadway by moving volumes of traffic safely and to preserve the aesthetic value of Pegasus Parkway including the natural and built environment. 
(c)  Regulations of underlying district. The overlay regulations are intended to supplement the regulations of the underlying zoning district. Unless specifically noted, the underlying zoning district regulations will govern the property with the overlay district providing supplemental requirements. If a conflict arises between the underlying zoning district and the overlay, the stricter of the rules applies. 
(d)  Establishment of overlay. The Pegasus Parkway Overlay shall be defined as the area on the official zoning map and more specifically identified on the Pegasus Parkway Overlay Map. The overlay shall apply to any parcels contiguous to the Pegasus Parkway right-of-way as it presently exists or may exist in the future. 
The Pegasus Parkway Overlay Zoning District shall be divided into two sub-districts, the industrial sub-district and the business commerce sub-district, based on anticipated land use patterns in the overall district. Because of anticipated land use patterns, some standards for development may differ between the two areas. 
(e)  Applicability. All new non-residential development within the Pegasus Parkway Corridor Overlay shall be subject to the requirements of this code section. 
(f)  Requirements.

Sec. 25-35-99. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of January 22, 2019, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to January 22, 2019, and is diligently prosecuted. Additionally, nothing contained herein shall prohibit construction of additions or additional floors to existing buildings provided that any such buildings were in use on January 22, 2019, the additions were contemplated and designated at the time of the original construction, and that additional costs were incurred at the time of the original construction to allow for those future additions or additional floors. 
(b)  Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, the owner of any existing or extended nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the LaGrange-Callaway Airport to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport obstruction.

Sec. 25-35-100. - Permits. 
(a)  Future uses. Except as specifically provided in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this subsection, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone created in this article unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted by the LaGrange building official. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. All structures and trees within the notification zone shall seek airspace approval by the Airport Manager or the FAA. Structures and trees outside of this zone shall seek airspace approval if required by Federal regulations. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this article shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, using the following criteria: 
(1)  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones. 
(2)  In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred (4,200) feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones. 
(3)  In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones. 
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree, in excess of any of the height limits established by this article. 
(b)  Existing uses. Except as provided in section 25-35-99(a), no permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on January 22, 2019, or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the LaGrange building official determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than eighty (80) percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
(d)  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article, may apply to the board of planning and zoning appeals for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances may be allowed where it is found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this article. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this article may be considered by the board of zoning appeals unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the LaGrange-Callaway Airport for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the LaGrange-Callaway Airport does not respond to the application within sixty (60) days after receipt, the board of planning and zoning appeals may act on its own to grant or deny said application. 
(e)  Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the board of planning and zoning appeals, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the LaGrange-Callaway Airport, at its own expense to install, operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights.

The existence of a nonconforming use of neighboring land, buildings or structures in the same district or of permitted or nonconforming uses in other districts shall not constitute a basis for the granting of a variance.

In exercising the above powers, the board of planning and zoning appeals may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the order, requirements, decisions or determinations, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit.

The forty-five-day notice provision required herein shall not be applicable if the affected local government, in its discretion, deems it necessary to begin the undertaking prior to the expiration of said forty-five (45) days to promote the safety, health, peace, security and general welfare of the local government and its inhabitants. 
(Ord. No. 99-25, § 1, 7-27-99) 
Sec. 25-35-242. - Certificate of appropriateness; review of applications; procedure; approval, notification or rejection; negotiations for acquisitions. 
(a)  Prior to reviewing an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall take such action as may be reasonably required to inform the owners of any property likely to be affected materially by the application and shall give the applicant and such owners an opportunity to be heard. In cases where the commission deems it necessary, it may, in its discretion, hold a public hearing concerning the application. 
(b)  The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change in appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historical or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district at issue. In making such determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to other pertinent factors, the following factors: 
(1)  The historical and architectural value and significance; 
(2)  Architectural style; 
(3)  General design, arrangement, texture and material of the architectural features involved; and 
(4)  The relationship thereof to the exterior or architectural style and pertinent features of other structures in the immediate neighborhood. 
(c)  In its review of applications for certificates of appropriateness, the commission shall not consider interior arrangement or uses having no effect on exterior features. 
(d)  The commission shall exert best efforts to either approve or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within thirty (30) days after the filing thereof, but in no event shall fail to act within forty-five (45) days after the filing of said application. Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission. Failure of the commission to act within the forty-five-day period herein established shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be required. 
(e)  In the event the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so and shall transmit a record of such action and the reasons therefor, in writing, to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action, which, in the opinion of the commission, would be proper if the application is disapproved as submitted. The applicant may make modifications to the plan and may resubmit the application at any time thereafter. 
(f)  In cases in which the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of an application for a certificate of appropriateness by the commission shall be binding upon the building official charged with issuing building permits; and, in such case, no building permit shall be issued. 
(g)  Where such action is authorized by the mayor and council and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preservation of a unique historic property, the commission may enter into negotiations with the owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange or otherwise of the property or any interest therein. 
(h)  Construction for which a certificate of appropriateness has been issued shall begin within twelve (12) months from the date of issuance of the certificate. A one-time extension may be granted by the commission for a period of up to twelve (12) months from the date of expiration provided that: 
(1)  The original certificate of appropriateness has not expired at the time application for an extension is filed; and 
(2)  The site or building conditions have not changed on the subject property and adjacent properties. 
Upon expiration of either the initial 12-month time limitation or any extension, an applicant must reapply for a certificate of appropriateness.

(a)  Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this chapter would result in exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of any specific property, the commission, in passing on applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to the provisions or to interpret the meaning of the provision so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided, however, that such variance, modification or interpretation shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the provisions so that the architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variations, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will in its judgment best fulfill the purpose of this chapter. 
(b)  Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the mayor and council; the mayor and council may approve, modify and approve, or reject the determination made by the commission if it finds that the commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision. 
(c)  Appeals from decisions of the mayor and council may be taken to the superior court in the manner provided by law for appeals from a conviction for municipal or county ordinance violations, in accordance with O.C.G.A. section 44-10-28(j) or its successor provision.

Sec. 35-1-37. - False burglar/hold-up and fire alarms. 
(a)  Purpose. The City of LaGrange, Georgia finds that excessive false alarms unduly burden the LaGrange Police and Fire Departments and waste limited law enforcement and fire services resources. The purpose of this section is to establish reasonable expectations of alarm users and to ensure that alarm users are held responsible for their use of alarm systems. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

False alarm means the activation of an alarm system through mechanical or electronic failure, malfunction, improper installation, or the negligence of the alarm user, his/her employees or agents, and signals activated to summon the LaGrange Police or Fire Departments unless the request for response was cancelled by the alarm user or his/her agent before the LaGrange Police or Fire arrive at the alarm location. An alarm is false within the meaning of this article when, upon inspection by the LaGrange Police Department or Fire Department, evidence indicates that no fire, unauthorized entry, robbery, or other such crime was committed or attempted in or on the premises which would have activated a properly functioning alarm system.

Unless otherwise required by law or unless the terms of the leave otherwise specify, if an Employee on an authorized leave of absence fails to return to active employment upon expiration of the leave of absence, the Employee will be considered terminated as of the date immediately preceding the approved leave period.

Current Credited Service shall include unused paid time off which the Employer elects to treat as Current Credited Service for a Terminated Participant for certain purposes, as provided and subject to any limitations contained in the Adoption Agreement; provided, however, that leave conversions will be permitted only if (i) the leave is for unused accrued paid time off for vacation and/or sick leave or for comparable paid-time-off under an established leave policy without regard to whether the leave is due to illness or incapacity, (ii) the leave policy qualifies as a bona fide sick and/or vacation leave plan for purposes of Code Section 409A and Treasury Regulation § 1.409A-1(a)(5), (iii) the Plan provides for service credit for an Employee's unused paid time off, provided that the eligibility requirements for participation in the Plan do not permit an Employee to become a Participant only in the Plan Year in which the Employee terminates employment, (iv) the conversion is automatic and the employee has no right to request a cash payment, (v) the unused paid time off is converted to service credit under a formula specified in the Adoption Agreement and which satisfies the definitely determinable standard of Treasury Regulation § 1.401-1(b)(1)(i), (vi) the Adopting Employer's Plan otherwise provides for service credit unrelated to the conversion of any Employee's unused paid time off, and (vii) the Participant's annual benefit, as adjusted by the leave conversion, does not exceed the limit under Code Section 415(b).

Section 3.03. - Credited Past Service. 
"Credited Past Service" shall mean the number of years and complete months of Service of a Participant with the Adopting Employer prior to his Enrollment Date which are treated as Credited Past Service under the Employer's Adoption Agreement for purposes of meeting the Plan's requirements for participation, vesting, retirement and death benefit eligibility, and/or or for purposes of computing the amount of benefits payable under the Plan, subject to any limitations established in the Master Plan or the Adoption Agreement.

Service may include absence from active employment with the Adopting Employer under conditions which are not treated by the Employer as a Termination of Employment, subject to Article IV concerning leaves of absence and any other conditions or limitations specified in the Master Plan and Adoption Agreement. For those Employers who elect in the Adoption Agreement to include elected or appointed members of the Governing Authority or Municipal Legal Officers as Eligible Employees, Service also means any tenure of office held by an elected or appointed member of the Governing Authority or a Municipal Legal Officer, provided that such tenure of office does not include any calendar period during which any elected or appointed member of the Governing Authority or Municipal Legal Officer is also in the regular service of the Employer as an Eligible Employee in another capacity.

Full months of Total Credited Service shall be treated as fractions of one (1) year. Partial months shall not be included in the calculation. The Employer may specify in the Adoption Agreement a maximum number of years that may be included as Total Credited Service. If an Employer elects in its Adoption Agreement to require Employee Contributions, Total Credited Service shall not include any period of time for which the Employee is required but fails to make such Employee Contributions to the Plan. 
An Employee excluded from participation because of age shall receive credit for all Service as required by law. 
ARTICLE IV. - ELIGIBILITY, QUALIFICATION AND PARTICIPATION 

Section 4.01. - Classes of Eligible Employees. 
The Employer shall designate in the Adoption Agreement the class(es) of Employees which are eligible to participate in the Plan. Provided, however, that if a person does not meet the definition of "Employee" contained in Article II, he or she may not be included in any Eligible Employee class. 
Section 4.02. - Qualifications for Participation. 
(a)  Minimum Service Requirement. With respect to each class of Eligible Regular Employees, the Employer may specify in the Adoption Agreement a minimum number of hours per week and/or a minimum number of months per year which are required to be scheduled and worked in order to establish and maintain one's status as an Eligible Employee. It shall be the responsibility of the Adopting Employer to determine whether these requirements are and continue to be satisfied. In determining whether said requirements are satisfied, the following rules shall apply: 
(1)  If an Employee is otherwise includable in an Eligible Regular Employee class, but he does not meet the minimum service requirements established by the Employer for said class pursuant to subsection (a) above, he or she shall not be considered an Eligible Employee, unless and until he satisfies such requirements. If an Eligible Regular Employee who has not yet become a Participant no longer meets said minimum service requirement, but he remains an Employee of the Employer, he or she shall no longer be considered an Eligible Regular Employee, unless and until he again satisfies the minimum requirement. 
(2)  No period of employment during which an Employee fails to satisfy the Employer's minimum service requirement and no leave of absence granted to such Employee shall be counted in determining whether any waiting period for participation established by the Employer pursuant to subsection (b) below has been satisfied. However, provided the Employee remains continuously employed by the Employer, such periods shall not be considered a break in Service under subsection (b)(1) below for purposes of satisfying said waiting period. 
(b)  Waiting Period. Unless otherwise specified by the Adopting Employer in an addendum to the Adoption Agreement, Eligible Regular Employees shall be required to complete one (1) year of continuous, uninterrupted Service with the Adopting Employer in order to commence participation in the Plan. In determining whether this waiting period has been satisfied, the following rules shall apply: 
(1)  Breaks in Service. If an Eligible Regular Employee has a break in Service prior to satisfying the waiting period for participation and later becomes reemployed by the Adopting Employer, he shall be required to again satisfy the waiting period in order to be eligible to participate in the Plan. Service rendered prior to said break in Service shall not be taken into account in determining whether the waiting period has been satisfied. 
(2)  Employed on Effective Date; Waiting Period Satisfied. If an Eligible Regular Employee is employed by the Adopting Employer on the Effective Date of the Plan and he has completed a period of continuous, uninterrupted Service as an Eligible Employee immediately prior to the Effective Date equal to or exceeding the length of the required waiting period, then he shall be considered to have satisfied the waiting period and he shall be eligible to commence participation in the Plan on the first day of the month immediately following or coinciding with the Effective Date of the Plan. 
(3)  Employed on Effective Date; Waiting Period Not Satisfied. If an Eligible Regular Employee is employed by the Adopting Employer on the Effective Date of the Plan, but he has not completed a period of continuous, uninterrupted Service as an Eligible Regular Employee immediately prior to the Effective Date equal to or exceeding the length of the required waiting period, then he shall be eligible to commence participation in the Plan on the first day of the month immediately following or coinciding with the date that he completes the minimum period of continuous, uninterrupted Service as an Eligible Regular Employee necessary to satisfy the required waiting period. 
(4)  Employed After the Effective Date. If an Eligible Regular Employee is initially employed by the Adopting Employer after the Effective Date of the Plan, he shall be eligible to commence participation in the Plan on the first day of the month immediately following or coinciding with the date that he completes the minimum period of continuous, uninterrupted Service as an Eligible Regular Employee necessary to satisfy the required waiting period. 
(5)  Treatment of Leaves of Absence. For purposes of determining whether the waiting period for participation has been satisfied, Service shall include any period of absence from employment which is required to be taken into account for such purpose under USERRA, the FMLA, or any other applicable federal or state law. Unless otherwise required by law or unless the terms of the leave otherwise specify, an authorized leave of absence granted to an Eligible Regular Employee by the Adopting Employer shall be counted as Credited Service for purposes of determining whether the waiting period for participation has been satisfied. However, unless otherwise required by law or unless the terms of the leave otherwise specify, if an Eligible Regular Employee on an authorized leave of absence fails to return to active employment upon expiration of the leave of absence, the Eligible Regular Employee shall be considered to have incurred a break in Service for purposes of meeting the waiting period for participation as of the date preceding the approved leave period. 
(6)  Treatment of Service as an Ineligible Employee. If an Employee of the Adopting Employer who is not an Eligible Employee becomes an Eligible Regular Employee while remaining continuously employed by the Adopting Employer, said Eligible Employee shall become eligible to commence participation on the first day of the month immediately following or coinciding with the date he meets the eligibility requirements for participation under this Article. For purposes of satisfying any waiting period imposed by the Adopting Employer, and unless otherwise specified in the Adoption Agreement, the Eligible Regular Employee's prior period of employment as an Ineligible Employee shall be credited in the same manner as Service as an Eligible Regular Employee, provided that during said prior period of service as an Ineligible Employee, he satisfied any minimum service requirement established by the Employer pursuant to Section 4.02(a). Unless otherwise specified in the Adoption Agreement, if an Eligible Regular Employee becomes an Ineligible Employee prior to satisfying the waiting period for participation in the Plan, his service as an Ineligible Employee shall be credited in the same manner as Service as an Eligible Regular Employee for purposes of satisfying said waiting period, provided that the Ineligible Employee satisfies the applicable minimum service requirements established for Eligible Employees pursuant to Section 4.02(a). However, in no event will an Ineligible Employee be permitted to become a Participant in the Plan unless and until he has satisfied the waiting period and has again become an Eligible Employee. For purposes of satisfying the waiting period, leaves of absence granted to an Ineligible Employee shall be treated in the same manner as leaves of absence for Eligible Regular Employees under paragraph (5) above. 
(7)  Prior Participation in Another GMEBS Plan. An Eligible Regular Employee who is hired after the Effective Date of the Plan shall be eligible to become a Participant on the first day of the month immediately following or coinciding with the date on which he is employed by the Adopting Employer, regardless of any waiting period requirement established by the Employer, provided that: (i) his immediate prior employment was with another employer in the GMEBS; (ii) he was a Participant in the previous employer's GMEBS Plan; and (iii) he satisfies any minimum service requirement established by the Adopting Employer pursuant to Section 4.02(a) for his class. 
Section 4.03. - Establishing Participation in the Plan. 
(a)  Mandatory vs. Optional Participation. Participation in the Plan shall be considered mandatory for all classes of Eligible Employees unless, with respect to a particular class, the Employer specifies in the Adoption Agreement that participation is optional for members of said class. 
(b)  Mandatory Participation. If participation is mandatory for a class of Eligible Employees, then all Eligible Employees in the class shall become Participants in the Plan on the first day of the month immediately following or coinciding with the date they satisfy the applicable waiting period and any other eligibility requirements for participation. Eligible Employees shall provide to the Pension Committee on an Applicable Form such participation enrollment information as shall be required by the Pension Committee, which shall include the Eligible Employee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Plan. Notwithstanding an Eligible Employee's failure to complete the Applicable Form, the Eligible Employee shall become a Participant as specified in the Adoption Agreement. 
(c)  Optional Participation. The Employer may specify in the Adoption Agreement that participation is optional for certain classes of Eligible Employees, including Employees in the following categories: elected or appointed members of the Governing Authority, Municipal Legal Officers, City Manager, and Department Heads. If participation is optional for an Eligible Employee, then the Eligible Employee may elect to become a Participant at his option by filing with the Pension Committee, on an Applicable Form, such information as shall be required to enroll in the Plan, which shall include the Eligible Employee's acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Plan. The election to participate must be made within 120 days after the later of: the date the Eligible Employee commences employment with the Adopting Employer, the date the Eligible Employee is elected or appointed to office, or the date participation in the Plan is first permitted for members of a class to which he belongs. The election to participate shall be irrevocable, and the failure to make an election within the 120-day time limit specified above shall be deemed an irrevocable election not to participate in the Plan. If Employee contributions are required under the Adopting Employer's Plan, then Eligible Employees who apply for participation within the 120 day period may be required to make retroactive contributions in order to receive credit under the Plan for creditable Service prior the date they apply to participate in the Plan. 
(d)  Participation in the Plan shall not give any Eligible Employee the right to be retained in the employ of the Adopting Employer nor, upon dismissal, to have any right or interest in the Trust Fund other than as herein provided. 
Section 4.04. - Change in Employment Status. 
(a)  Transfer to Ineligible Status. Unless otherwise specified by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement, if a Participant's employment status changes such that he becomes an Ineligible Employee, he shall cease to accrue benefits under the Plan for any purpose and his interest under the Plan, if any, shall be only such as existed immediately before he became an Ineligible Employee, unless and until he again becomes a Participant. In no event will his service or earnings as an Ineligible Employee be taken into account for purposes of meeting the Plan's minimum service requirements for vesting, retirement eligibility, death benefit eligibility, or for purposes of computing the amount of any benefit payable under the Plan. However, said period of service as an Ineligible Employee shall not be considered a break in Service under Section 4.06, provided the Ineligible Employee remains continuously employed by the Adopting Employer. If the Ineligible Employee does not again become a Participant prior to Retirement or Termination of Employment, his Vested Benefit, if any, shall be paid as provided in Article IX. 
(b)  Transfer Back to Eligible Status. If an Ineligible Employee described in subsection (a) above remains continuously employed by the Adopting Employer and he has another change in employment status such that he again becomes a Participant, he shall thereafter be entitled to accrue benefits in accordance with the terms of the Plan as in effect as of the date of the subsequent change in employment status. In no event, however, shall such a Participant receive a greater benefit under the Plan than that which the Participant would have received had the Participant not had a change in employment status. 
Section 4.05. - Participant Leaves of Absence. 
(a)  USERRA, FMLA Leave. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, if any period of absence is required to be counted under USERRA, the FMLA or any other applicable federal or state law as Current Credited Service for the purpose of computing the amount of any benefit payable under the Plan, or for purposes of meeting the Plan's minimum service requirements for vesting, retirement or death benefit eligibility, then said period of absence shall be counted as such in accordance with and subject to the requirements of such law. 
(b)  Other Leaves of Absence. Unless otherwise required by law or unless the terms of the leave otherwise specify, an authorized leave of absence granted to a Participant by the Adopting Employer will be counted as Current Credited Service for the purpose of computing the amount of any benefit payable under the Plan, and for purposes of meeting the Plan's minimum service requirements for vesting and benefit eligibility. However, if the Participant does not return to active employment upon expiration of the authorized leave period, then subsection (c) shall apply. 
(c)  Failure to Return to Service. Unless otherwise required by law or unless the terms of the leave otherwise specify, if a Participant does not return to active employment with the Employer upon expiration of a leave of absence, his interest under the Plan, if any, including his Current Credited Service for the purpose of computing the amount of any benefit payable under the Plan, and for purposes of meeting the Plan's minimum service requirements for vesting and any minimum service requirements for retirement or death benefit eligibility, will be limited to that accrued as of the date preceding the approved leave period. 
(d)  Unused Leave. The Adopting Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to credit certain unused leave at termination or retirement as Credited Service, subject to the terms and limits specified in the Adoption Agreement. 
Section 4.06. - Non-Vested Participant Breaks in Service. 
Except as otherwise provided in the Adoption Agreement, this Section shall apply only to Participants who are Eligible Regular Employees. If a non-vested Participant experiences a break in Service, the Participant's Current Credited Service shall not include any Service rendered prior to the break in Service, unless the Participant returns to employment with the Adopting Employer and performs the lesser of: Service equal to the break in Service, or Service equal to one (1) year. 
The following limitations shall apply in administering the break in Service rule: 
(a)  Absence of Less Than One (1) Year. If a Participant terminates employment with the Adopting Employer and returns to employment with the Adopting Employer within one (1) year after said termination, the Participant shall not be deemed to have incurred a break in Service. Except as otherwise required under this Section, however, the time he was absent shall not be taken into account for any purpose under the Plan. 
(b)  Interim Employment with Another GMEBS Employer. If a Participant terminates employment with the Adopting Employer and returns to employment with the Adopting Employer after having spent the interim period in the continuous employment of another Employer in the GMEBS, he shall not be deemed to have incurred a break in Service. The time he was absent may be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the Participant has met the minimum Service requirements for vesting and retirement eligibility under the Adopting Employer's Plan, as provided by and subject to the provisions of Section 9.05 concerning portability. However, in no event shall the time he was absent from the Adopting Employer be taken into account for the purpose of computing the amount of any benefit payable under the Adopting Employer's Plan. 
(c)  Treatment of Leaves of Absence. No leave of absence or other period of absence from employment shall be considered a break in Service if it is not permitted to be treated as such under USERRA, the FMLA, or any other applicable federal or state law. Unless otherwise required by law or unless the terms of the leave otherwise specify, any other authorized leave of absence granted to a Participant shall not be deemed a break in Service, provided the Participant was regularly employed by the Employer immediately prior to his leave of absence and the Participant is reemployed by the Employer upon expiration of the leave of absence. Unless otherwise required by law or unless the terms of the leave otherwise specify, if a Participant does not return to active employment upon expiration of the approved leave period, he will be considered to have incurred a break in Service under this Section as of the date immediately preceding the approved leave period. 
(d)  Transfer to Ineligible Employee Status. Unless otherwise specified by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement, if a Participant's employment status changes such that he becomes an Ineligible Employee pursuant to Section 4.04, the period of time spent as an Ineligible Employee shall not be considered a break in Service under this Section, provided the Participant remains employed by the Adopting Employer. Unless otherwise specified by the Adopting Employer, leaves of absence granted to an Ineligible Employee will not be considered a break in Service under this Section, provided the Ineligible Employee returns to active employment with the Employer upon expiration of the approved leave period and the requirements of subsection (c) are otherwise satisfied with respect to such leave of absence. 
(e)  Graduated Vesting. If the Adopting Employer has established a graduated vesting schedule in the Adoption Agreement, then a break in Service shall not affect that percentage of the Retirement Benefit in which a Participant is Vested prior to the break. 
(f)  Repeated Breaks in Service. If a non-vested Participant has a break in Service, returns to employment with the Adopting Employer, and experiences one or more additional breaks in Service prior to satisfying the one (1) year Service requirement necessary to work off the initial break, then the Participant's Current Credited Service shall not include any Service rendered prior to the most recent break in Service, unless upon the Participant's return to employment with the Employer following the most recent break in Service he performs Service for a period equal to one (1) year. 
ARTICLE V. - RETIREMENT ELIGIBILITY 
(a)  The Retirement prerequisites of a Participant under this Plan are contingent upon the type of Retirement offered by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement and selected by the Participant: that is, Normal Retirement, Alternative Normal Retirement, Early Retirement, Late Retirement, or Disability Retirement, as applicable. The provision of an Alternative Normal Retirement benefit or the designation of an Alternative Normal Retirement Date in the Adoption Agreement shall not be construed to establish an Alternative Normal Retirement Age or Alternative Normal Retirement Date for purposes of the definition of Accrued Benefit under Section 2.01, for purposes of computing death benefits under Article VIII, or for purposes of applying the actuarial equivalent conversion provisions of Article XII. The minimum age and service requirements and other prerequisites associated with each type of Retirement for each class of Eligible Employees shall be as specified in the pertinent sections of the Adoption Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in the Adoption Agreement with respect to in-service distributions for those who remain in service after their Normal Retirement Date, receipt of Retirement benefits shall also be contingent upon Termination of Employment. 
(b)  Provided a Participant is otherwise eligible to receive a Retirement benefit under the Plan, Retirement is contingent upon the satisfactory completion of the Applicable Form provided for such purpose and the acceptance of the Applicable Form by the Pension Committee. 
(c)  Retirement applications shall be prepared and submitted at such time as to reach the office of GMEBS no earlier than ninety (90) days and no later than thirty (30) days prior to a Participant's effective Retirement Date. A Participant's effective Retirement date shall be the first day of the month coinciding with or following the date he has satisfied all of the prerequisites for Retirement as specified in this Article V, and actually Retires. 
ARTICLE VI. RETIREMENT BENEFITS 

Section 6.01. - Normal Retirement Benefit. 
(a)  A Participant, upon Retirement on or after his Normal Retirement Date (or Alternative Normal Retirement Date, as applicable), shall receive a Monthly Retirement Benefit under which payments shall commence on the last day of the month in which his effective Retirement Date occurs and shall be payable on the last day of each month thereafter during his lifetime. However, if directed by the Employer, Normal Retirement Benefits may be paid retroactively to the last day of the month following the month in which the Participant's Termination occurs (or, if the Participant's Termination occurs on the first of the month, the last day of said month) or if later, the last day of the month in which his Normal Retirement Date occurs. The amount of the Monthly Retirement Benefit shall be determined based upon the applicable benefit formula specified in the Adoption Agreement and in effect at the Participant's Termination. If the Participant elects a form of benefit payment other than the standard form, the amount of the Monthly Retirement Benefit will be adjusted in accordance with and subject to the terms of the option elected (see Section 7.01). Effective November 1, 2007, all references in this subsection to "last day" shall be changed to "first day." 
(b)  No interest shall be paid on the retroactive payment of Normal Retirement benefits. 
Section 6.02. - Early Retirement Benefit. 
(a)  A Participant, upon Retirement on or after his Early Retirement Date and before his Normal Retirement Date or Alternative Normal Retirement Date, shall receive a Monthly Retirement Benefit under which payments shall commence on the last day of the month in which his effective Retirement Date occurs and shall be payable on the last day of each month thereafter during the lifetime of the Participant. The amount of such Monthly Retirement Benefit shall be computed in the same manner as for a Normal Retirement Benefit, but reduced on an Actuarially Equivalent basis in accordance with the actuarial table contained in Section 12.01. An Adopting Employer may adopt in the Adoption Agreement an alternative early retirement actuarial reduction table for one or more classes of Eligible Employees, provided the adoption of such table satisfies the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(25). Effective November 1, 2007, all references in this subsection to "last day" shall be changed to "first day." 
(b)  Provided the Employer has elected in the Adoption Agreement to provide Disability benefits, a Participant who is otherwise eligible for an Early Retirement Benefit may apply for and receive an Early Retirement benefit while a Disability benefit determination is pending. Upon a determination that the Participant is entitled to receive a Disability benefit, the Participant's benefit will be changed to a Disability Benefit (if greater), retroactive to the Disability Retirement Date. However, no change in the form of benefit payment or designation of the Post-Retirement Beneficiary may be made, and no Post-Retirement Beneficiary may be named if one had not been previously named. 
(c)  Retroactive payment of Early Retirement benefits to the Participant's Early Retirement Date or date of Termination is not permitted. 
Section 6.03. - Late Retirement Benefit. 
A Participant may retire from the active Service of the Adopting Employer on the first day of any month after his Normal Retirement Date, in which case the Participant shall receive a Late Retirement Benefit. The Late Retirement Benefit shall be calculated in the same manner as the Normal Retirement Benefit. However, the Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to provide for an increased Late Retirement Benefit, in which case the Late Retirement Benefit shall be calculated in the same manner as the Normal Retirement Benefit, but increased as provided in the Adoption Agreement. 
Section 6.04. - Disability Benefit. 
(a)  Provided the Employer has elected in the Adoption Agreement to provide Disability benefits, a Participant who becomes Disabled and is otherwise entitled to receive a Disability Retirement Benefit shall receive such benefit in accordance with this Section. Payments shall commence on the last day of the month coinciding with the Participant's Disability Retirement Date and shall be payable on the last day of said month and of each month thereafter during the Participant's Disability. No Disability benefit shall be payable unless application for such benefit is made within one (1) year after employment is terminated as a result of such Disability, except when the delay is caused by the pendency of a Disability determination by the Social Security Administration or the Pension Committee, as applicable. The amount of the monthly Disability Retirement Benefit shall be determined as provided in the Adoption Agreement. The Adopting Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to specify another method for calculation of the benefit, and require an offset against the monthly Disability Retirement Benefit for other types of payments received by the Participant. Upon Retirement, the Participant shall receive the monthly Disability Retirement Benefit provided in this Section, or any other Monthly Retirement Benefit granted under the Plan for which he is eligible if such benefit is greater than the aforesaid monthly Disability Retirement Benefit. However, under no circumstances shall any Retired Participant be entitled at one time to more than one type of Retirement benefit granted under the Plan. Effective November 1, 2007 all references in this subsection to "last day" shall be changed to "first day." 
(b)  No interest shall be paid on the retroactive payment of Disability benefits. 
Section 6.05. - Cost of Living Adjustment. 
(a)  An Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to provide for a variable annual cost-of-living adjustment in the amount of benefits payable under the Plan to Participants or their Beneficiaries. In such event, the amount of benefits payable under the Plan shall be adjusted as provided in this Section, except as otherwise provided in the Employer's Adoption Agreement. 
(b)  The Current Average Cost-of-Living Index Figure as defined in Section 2.19 shall be ascertained as of January 1 in each year. 
(c)  Each Monthly Retirement Benefit then being received by Participants who terminate after the date specified in the Adoption Agreement and their Beneficiaries shall thereupon be adjusted as follows: 
(1)  Each Monthly Retirement Benefit shall be increased by the percentage that the Current Average Cost-of-Living Index Figure increased over each recipient's Cost-of-Living Base Figure, as defined in Section 2.15. If the Current Average Cost-of-Living Index Figure is less than the Cost-of-Living Base Figure, no reduction in the Monthly Retirement Benefit, shall be effected. Increased benefits are payable at the end of the month in which the adjustment is made. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, no increase in the amount of a Monthly Retirement Benefit due to changes in the Current Average Cost-of-Living Index Figure effective at any annual adjustment date (January 1) shall be in excess of a certain percentage of the amount of the Monthly Retirement Benefit payable immediately prior to each Participant's or Beneficiary's applicable adjustment date. Said percentage limit shall be designated by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement. 
(d)  An Adopting Employer may implement one-time or ad-hoc cost-of-living adjustments by adopting an Addendum to the Adoption Agreement to effect said increase. 
(e)  In lieu of the variable cost-of-living adjustment referred to in subsections (a)—(c) above, the Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to provide for a fixed annual cost-of-living adjustment, subject to any limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code or regulations issued thereunder. 
Section 6.06. - Suspension of Benefits. 
(a)  General Rule. Unless otherwise provided in this Section and in the Adoption Agreement, if a Retired Participant returns to Service as an Eligible Employee with an Adopting Employer from whose Trust Fund the Retired Participant is receiving a Monthly Retirement Benefit, said Monthly Retirement Benefit shall be suspended as of the date of said return to Service. The Adopting Employer may engage on a retainer or fee basis any person receiving benefits hereunder and such engagement will not terminate or suspend such benefits. In such case, said person will not accrue benefits or service credit for any purpose under the Plan during said period of reemployment. 
(b)  Re-Computation of Benefit in Case of Suspension. In any case where the payment of a Participant's Retirement benefit shall have been suspended, the Retirement benefit payable on his re-retirement (whether before or after his Normal Retirement Date) shall be the benefit computed in accordance with this Article on the basis of his aggregate Total Credited Service at the time of his subsequent re-retirement, but reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of any Retirement benefits received by him prior to his return to Service as an Eligible Employee, and by any actuarial factors used in calculating the benefit payable at the time of his previous Retirement. For purposes of this subsection, the term "Actuarial Equivalent" shall mean an amount equal to the value of Retirement benefits received, determined as of the date of the Participant's re-retirement and computed on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in Section 12.07. In no event shall the resulting benefit be less than the benefit payable at the time of his previous Retirement. A Retired Participant who is reemployed as an Eligible Employee shall not be authorized to change his form of benefit payment on his subsequent re-retirement, or to change his Post-Retirement Beneficiary, or to name a Post-Retirement Beneficiary if one had not been previously named. For the purposes of this Section, any such Participant's Credited Service subsequent to his reemployment by the Employer as an Eligible Employee shall commence as of the date of his reemployment as an Eligible Employee. 
(c)  Reemployment After Normal Retirement Date; In-Service Distribution. Notwithstanding the requirement for suspension of benefits upon reemployment under subsection (a) above, an Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to permit Retired Participants or certain classes of Retired Participants to continue receiving Retirement benefits if they return to Service with the Adopting Employer as an Eligible Employee on or after their Normal Retirement Date. The Employer may also elect to permit Retired Participants or certain classes of Retired Participants to continue receiving Retirement benefits if they return to Service with the Adopting Employer as an Eligible Employee on or after their Alternative Normal Retirement Date. If the Employer has made such an election in the Adoption Agreement, then Retired Participants who are designated in the Adoption Agreement as eligible to receive in-service distributions may continue to receive their Monthly Retirement Benefit if they return to Service with the Adopting Employer as an Eligible Employee on or after their Normal Retirement Date or Alternative Normal Retirement Date, as applicable. Upon said Participants' subsequent re-retirement, their Monthly Retirement Benefit shall be computed in accordance with this Article on the basis of their aggregate Total Credited Service at the time of re-retirement, but it shall be reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of any Retirement benefits received prior to re-retirement, and by any actuarial factors used in calculating the benefit payable at the previous Retirement. For purposes of this subsection, the term "Actuarial Equivalent" shall mean an amount equal to the value of Retirement benefits received, determined as of the date of the Participant's re-retirement and computed on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in Section 12.07. In no event shall the resulting benefit be less than the benefit payable at the time of the previous Retirement. A Retired Participant who returns to Service as an Eligible Employee shall not be authorized to change his form of benefit payment, or to change his Post-Retirement Beneficiary on his subsequent re-retirement, or to name a Post-Retirement Beneficiary if one had not been previously named. 
(d)  Reemployment Prior to Normal Retirement Date; In-Service Distribution Upon Attaining Normal Retirement Date. This subsection shall apply only if an Employer has elected in the Adoption Agreement to permit in-service distribution of benefits upon reemployment after the Normal Retirement Date (or Alternative Normal Retirement Date, as applicable) pursuant to subsection (c) above, and if the Retired Participant belongs to a class for which in-service distributions are permitted under the Adoption Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e) below, if a Retired Participant returns to Service as an Eligible Employee with the Adopting Employer before his Normal Retirement Date, his Retirement benefit payments shall be suspended in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) above. However, if after becoming reemployed said Participant remains employed until his Normal Retirement Date (or Alternative Normal Retirement Date, as applicable), and if the Participant is otherwise eligible to receive a Normal Retirement Benefit, the Participant may apply for and receive a Monthly Retirement Benefit on or after his Normal Retirement Date (or Alternative Normal Retirement Date, as applicable), notwithstanding his continued Service with the Employer. Said Monthly Retirement Benefit shall be computed in accordance with this Article, based upon the Participant's Total Credited Service through the date he recommences receipt of his Monthly Retirement Benefit pursuant to this subsection, but it shall be reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of any Retirement benefits received by the Participant prior to his return to Service, and by any actuarial factors used in calculating the benefit payable at the time of his previous Retirement. For purposes of this subsection, the term "Actuarial Equivalent" shall mean an amount equal to the value of Retirement benefit payments received, determined as of the date the Participant recommences receipt of his Monthly Retirement Benefit, and computed on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in Section 12.07. In no event shall the resulting Monthly Retirement Benefit be less than the Participant's initial Monthly Retirement Benefit. Upon the Participant's subsequent re-retirement, his Monthly Retirement Benefit shall be re-computed in accordance with this Article on the basis of his aggregate Total Credited Service at the time of his re-retirement, reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of any Retirement benefits received by him prior to his re-retirement. For purposes of this subsection, the term "Actuarial Equivalent" shall mean an amount equal to the value of Retirement benefit payments received, determined as of the date of the Participant's re-retirement and computed on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in Section 12.07. In no event shall the resulting Monthly Retirement Benefit be less than the prior Monthly Retirement Benefit. The Participant shall not be authorized under this subsection to change his form of benefit payment, or to change his Post-Retirement Beneficiary, or to name a Post-Retirement Beneficiary if one had not been previously named. 
(e)  Reemployment After Early Retirement Date; In-Service Distribution. An Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to permit Retired Participants or certain classes of Retired Participants who are receiving an Early Retirement benefit to continue receiving said benefit if they return to Service with the Employer as an Eligible Employee at any time on or after their Early Retirement Date. If the Employer has made such an election, and if a Retired Participant belongs to a class for which such in-service distributions are permitted, then upon the Retired Participant's return to Service with the Employer as an Eligible Employee after his Early Retirement Date, the Retired Participant may continue to receive his Monthly Retirement Benefit during the period of his reemployment. However, this provision shall apply only if the Participant's previous Retirement was in good faith and the Participant does not return to Service as an Eligible Employee following his initial effective Retirement date for a minimum period designated by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement which shall not be less than six (6) months. Upon the Participant's subsequent re-retirement, his Monthly Retirement Benefit shall be computed in accordance with this Article on the basis of his aggregate Credited Service at the time of his re-retirement, but it shall be reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of any Retirement benefits received by him prior to his re-Retirement, and by any actuarial factors used in calculating the benefit payable at his previous Retirement. For purposes of this subsection, the term "Actuarial Equivalent" shall mean an amount equal to the value of Retirement benefit received, determined as of the date of the Participant's re-retirement and computed on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in Section 12.07. In no event shall the resulting benefit be less than the benefit payable at the time of his previous Retirement. Such a Participant shall not be authorized to change his form of benefit payment on his subsequent re-retirement, or to change his Post-Retirement Beneficiary, or to name a Post-Retirement Beneficiary if one had not been previous named. 
(f)  Death in Service After Reemployment. If a Retired Participant returns to Service with an Adopting Employer as an Eligible Employee and he dies during the period of his reemployment and before re-retirement, then his Post-Retirement Beneficiary, if any, shall be entitled to receive the greater of: (1) the monthly post-retirement survivor benefit payable, if any; or (2) the monthly in-service death benefit, if any, payable for the class of Eligible Employees to which the Participant belongs as of his date of death, reduced by the Actuarial Equivalent of any Retirement benefits received by the Participant prior to his death. This provision shall not be interpreted to permit payment to a Pre-Retirement Beneficiary in the event of a Retired Participant's death during reemployment. 
(g)  Suspension of Disability Benefits. Any Disability Retirement Benefit payable under the Plan to any Participant shall be suspended as of the first day of the month coinciding with or following the date his Disability ceases. A Participant's Disability shall be considered to have ceased upon the earliest of the following dates: (1) with respect to Participants whose entitlement to a Disability benefit is based upon receipt of disability insurance benefits under the Federal Social Security Act, the date as of which the Social Security Administration determines that the Participant is no longer disabled; or (2) with respect to Participants whose entitlement to a Disability benefit is based upon a determination by the Pension Committee, the date as of which the Pension Committee determines that the Participant is no longer disabled as defined under Code Section 72(m), based upon an examination by a physician chosen by the Pension Committee. With respect to those Participants whose entitlement to a Disability benefit is based upon receipt of disability insurance benefits under the Federal Social Security Act, the Participant shall be required to notify the Pension Committee Secretary within sixty (60) days after the Participant receives notice that the Social Security Administration has determined that the Participant is no longer disabled. With respect to those Participants whose entitlement to a Disability benefit is based upon receipt of disability insurance benefits under the Federal Social Security Act, the Pension Committee shall have the right to require the Participant to prove at any time, as a condition for continued receipt of Disability benefits under the Plan, continued eligibility for receipt of disability insurance benefits under the Federal Social Security Act, as amended. With respect to Participants whose entitlement to a Disability benefit is based upon a determination of Disability by the Pension Committee, the Pension Committee shall have the right to require, as a condition for continued receipt of Disability benefits, that the Participant be examined at any time by a physician chosen by the Pension Committee. In the event that any Participant fails or refuses to submit to a physical examination or to obtain and provide other information requested by the Pension Committee to confirm continuation of a Disability, then the Participant's Disability benefits shall be suspended as of the first day of the month following expiration of the ninety (90) day period following the Pension Committee's request for such examination or information, unless the Pension Committee determines in its discretion that the failure to comply was due to circumstances beyond the Participant's control, in which case the ninety (90) day time limit may be extended by the Pension Committee. 
(h)  Suspension of Disability Benefit; Right to Other Benefits. In any case where the payment of a Participant's Disability Retirement benefit is suspended, the period of absence from employment due to such Disability shall be treated as a leave of absence without pay, except that such period of absence shall not be counted as Credited Service. Any Participant who shall have retired or been retired for Disability and who dies or who has been or shall be subsequently declared ineligible for a Disability Retirement Benefit because of the cessation of said Disability shall have a right to any benefit afforded under any other provision of this Plan to which he or his Beneficiary might otherwise be entitled. In such case, any Disability Retirement payments made prior to the date as of which his Disability ceases or as of which it is declared to no longer exist shall be retained by the Retiree and disregarded in computing any other benefit payable under the Plan. 
ARTICLE VII. - OPTIONAL FORMS OF RETIREMENT INCOME 

Section 7.01. - Standard Benefit Payment Form; Other Payment Options. 
A Participant may elect, or may revoke a previous election and make a new election, at any time prior to his effective Retirement Date, to have his Retirement benefit payable under the standard benefit payment option or under one of the other benefit payment options set forth in Section 7.03. The standard benefit payment option is a monthly retirement benefit payable to the Participant during his life time only. At the death of the Participant all payments will cease and no further benefits will be payable to the estate of the Participant or other persons. The standard benefit payment form is referred to in the Master Plan as Option A. The benefit shall be paid in accordance with and subject to the terms of the benefit payment option elected. Election of any option shall be made by the Participant in writing on the Applicable Form, and shall be subject to approval by GMEBS. 
Section 7.02. - Designation of Post-Retirement Beneficiary. 
If the Participant elects Option B or Option C (Joint and Survivor Options) or Option D (Period Certain and Life Option) in Section 7.03, he shall designate a Post-Retirement Beneficiary to receive a survivor benefit in accordance with and subject to the terms of such Option. Designation of a Post-Retirement Beneficiary may be revoked or changed by the Participant by submitting a new completed Retirement Application at any time prior to the Participant's effective Retirement date. Only the last such designation of a Post-Retirement Beneficiary shall have effect, and any new designation of a Post-Retirement Beneficiary shall invalidate, supersede, and revoke any prior designation. 
Section 7.03. - Description of Options. 
The amount of any optional benefit set forth below shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount of benefit that would otherwise be payable to the Participant under Section 6.01. 
OPTION B: Joint and Survivor Option. A decreased retirement benefit which shall be payable during the lifetime of the Participant and, if his designated Post-Retirement Beneficiary should survive him, shall continue after his death during the lifetime of his Beneficiary in the same amount (100%) or in such smaller amount (75%, 50%, or 25%) as the Participant may designate. This option shall be known as Option B. The Participant's retirement benefit under Option B shall be calculated in accordance with Section 12.02(a)(1) or 12.02(a)(2), whichever is applicable. 
OPTION C: Joint and Survivor Option with Pop-Up. A retirement benefit computed and paid in the same manner as OPTION B above, but with a further decrease in the retirement benefit to account for the pop-up benefit provided under this Option C. If the Participant elects Option C, then in the event that the Participant's Post-Retirement Beneficiary dies before the Participant and after Retirement benefit payments have commenced, and provided the Participant furnishes GMEBS with proper proof of the Beneficiary's death within one (1) year after such death, the requirement for a reduction in the Participant's monthly retirement benefit on account of his election of an optional form of benefit payment shall no longer apply, effective as of the first day of the month following the Post-Retirement Beneficiary's death. Effective with respect to monthly payments made on and after such date, the amount of the Participant's monthly retirement benefit shall be increased to equal the monthly amount that would have otherwise been payable to the Participant under Article VI, had the Participant not elected an optional form of benefit payment. However, if the Participant fails to furnish the Plan with proper proof of the Post-Retirement Beneficiary's death within the one (1) year period referred to above, then said increase shall not become effective until the first day of the month following the date such proof is submitted to GMEBS. If the Post-Retirement Beneficiary does not survive the Participant, all payments shall cease at the death of the Participant and no further benefits will accrue to his estate or to other persons. 
OPTION D: Period Certain and Life Option. A decreased benefit payable monthly to the Participant during his lifetime and, in the event of his death within a period of specified years, either five (5), ten (10), fifteen (15), or twenty (20) years after his benefit commencement, the same monthly amount shall be payable for the balance of such period to the Post-Retirement Beneficiary designated by him. If the Post-Retirement Beneficiary does not survive the Participant, all payments shall cease at the death of the Participant and no further benefits will accrue to his estate or to other persons except as provided in Article VIII. This option shall be known as Option D. The Retirement benefit under Option D shall be calculated in accordance with Section 12.03. 
OPTION E: Social Security Option. An increased Retirement benefit, determined as of the Participant's Early Retirement Date, payable to him during his lifetime until the Participant is eligible for reduced benefits under the Federal Social Security Act, and a decreased Retirement benefit payable thereafter for life in order to have a more level retirement income when such decreased retirement benefit is added to his primary benefits under the Federal Social Security Act. At the death of the Participant all payments will cease and no further benefits will accrue to the estate of the Participant or to other persons. This option shall be known as Option E. The Actuarial Equivalent factors to be applied in calculating benefits under Option E shall be those contained in Section 12.04(a) or 4(b), whichever is applicable. 
Section 7.04. - Cancellation of Election. 
The election by a Participant of any option in this Article VII shall be null and void if either the Participant or his designated Post-Retirement Beneficiary dies before the Participant's effective Retirement date. 
Section 7.05. - Rule for Small Benefits. 
(a)  Effective January 1, 2002, the present value of a Plan benefit shall be distributed in a cash single sum payment to the Participant, Terminated Participant, or Pre-Retirement Beneficiary, as applicable, if the benefit payable to the recipient does not exceed Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) on the date of distribution. The value of said Plan benefit shall be determined in accordance with Article XII. 
(b)  Effective for distributions commencing on or after March 28, 2005, if a distribution to be made under subsection (a) is greater than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000), is an eligible rollover distribution, and the recipient of the distribution does not elect to have the distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the recipient in a direct rollover or does not elect to receive the distribution directly, the Administrator will pay the distribution in a direct rollover to an individual retirement plan designated by the Administrator. 
(c)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b), effective on and after July 1, 2007, no distribution will be made under this Section unless and until the recipient of the distribution makes an election to either have the distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the recipient in a direct rollover or to receive the distribution directly in cash. 
Section 7.06. - Distributions. 
(a)  Distributions payable as of any date shall be made on or as soon as administratively feasible after that date. 
(b)  In a contributory plan, interest shall be paid on any refund of employee contributions only as specified in the Adoption Agreement. 
Section 7.07. - Compliance with Internal Revenue Section 401(a)(9). 
All distributions shall be made in compliance with Article X. 
ARTICLE VIII. - DEATH BENEFITS 

Section 8.01. - Death in Service Prior to Retirement. 
In the event a Participant's employment or term of office is Terminated by reason of his death prior to his Retirement, there shall be paid to his Pre-Retirement Beneficiary (Primary, Secondary, or Default Beneficiary, as applicable), the in-service death benefit elected by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement, provided the requirements of this Article are satisfied. 
Section 8.02. - Actuarial Reserve In-Service Death Benefit. 
An Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to provide the Actuarial Reserve In-Service Death Benefit for one or more classes of Eligible Employees. In such case, the Employer shall designate in the Adoption Agreement the minimum Service and other eligibility requirements a Participant must satisfy in order to be entitled to receive such benefit. Provided a Participant satisfies such requirements, then in the event the Participant's employment with the Adopting Employer is terminated by reason of his death prior to his Retirement, there shall be paid to his Pre-Retirement Beneficiary a lifetime monthly death benefit actuarially equivalent to the reserve required for the Participant's anticipated Normal Retirement benefit. In calculating the Normal Retirement benefit under the provisions of this Section, the following assumptions shall be used: 
(1)  The Participant's age at the time of his death is equal to the Normal Retirement Age as specified by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement, or his attained age if his attained age is greater than the Normal Retirement Age; and, 
(2)  The Participant's Total Credited Service shall include the amount of Total Credited Service accrued prior to the date of the Participant's death. The Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to include additional imputed Credited Service in the calculation, but in no event shall be amount of Total Credited Service used in the calculation exceed the sum of actual Service performed plus ten (10) calendar years. The death benefit under this Section shall be calculated using the factors contained in Section 12.05. 
Section 8.03. - Auto A In-Service Death Benefit. 
An Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to provide the Auto A in-service death benefit for one or more classes of Eligible Employees. In such case, the Employer shall designate in the Adoption Agreement the minimum Service and other eligibility requirements a Participant must satisfy in order to be entitled to such benefit. Provided a Participant satisfies such requirements, then in the event that the Participant's employment with the Adopting Employer is terminated by reason of his death prior to his Retirement, there shall be paid to his Pre-Retirement Beneficiary a lifetime monthly death benefit, as follows: 
(a)  Monthly Death Benefit Payable to Spouse. If the Pre-Retirement Beneficiary to whom the in-service death benefit is payable under this Section (Primary, Secondary, or Default Pre-Retirement Beneficiary, as applicable) is the Participant's Spouse, then the lifetime monthly death benefit payable to said Spouse shall commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or immediately following the date of the Participant's death. Alternatively, the Spouse may elect to defer benefit payment commencement until the first day of any month up to and including the date the Participant would have attained Normal Retirement Age as defined in the Employer's Adoption Agreement. For purposes of this Section, the term "Spouse" or "Spouse Beneficiary" shall be as defined in Section 2.59. A Spouse shall be considered to have deferred benefit payment commencement until the first day of the month following the date the Spouse makes application for payment of death benefits. If the Pre-Retirement Beneficiary to whom the in-service death benefit is payable under this Section (Primary, Secondary, or Default Pre-Retirement Beneficiary, as applicable) is not the Spouse of the Participant, then the lifetime monthly death benefit payable to said Beneficiary shall commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or immediately following the date of the Participant's death. 
(b)  Computation of Monthly Death Benefits. Benefits under this Section shall be computed as of the date of the Participant's death, based upon the applicable benefit formula in effect on said date, as follows: 
(1)  Participant Death Before Early Retirement Age; Payment Before Early Retirement Age. If a Participant dies before attaining Early Retirement Age as defined in the Employer's Adoption Agreement, and if benefit payments commence to a Pre-Retirement Beneficiary (Primary, Secondary, or Default Beneficiary, as applicable) before the Participant would have attained Early Retirement Age, then the monthly death benefit payable to said Beneficiary shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the monthly Retirement benefit amount that would have otherwise been payable to the Participant, assuming the Participant: (i) terminated employment on his date of death; (ii) survived until Normal Retirement Age as defined in the Adoption Agreement; and (iii) elected to retire upon attaining Normal Retirement Age with the optional form of Retirement payment designated in Section 7.03 as Option B at one hundred percent (100%), and then died. Said benefit shall be calculated in accordance with the actuarial assumptions specified in Section 12.07. 
(2)  Participant Death Before Early Retirement Age; Deferred Payment by Spouse Until After Early Retirement Age. If the Participant dies before attaining Early Retirement Age as defined in the Employer's Adoption Agreement and a Spouse who is eligible to receive the in-service death benefit hereunder defers payment until a date which is on or after the date the Participant would have attained Early Retirement Age, then the monthly death benefit payable to the Spouse Beneficiary shall be the monthly Retirement benefit that would have otherwise been payable to the Participant, assuming that the Participant: (i) terminated employment on the date of death; (ii) survived until the date upon which the deferred benefit payments commence in accordance with the Spouse Beneficiary's selected benefit commencement date; and, (iii) elected to retire on the benefit commencement date with the optional form of Retirement payment designated in Section 7.03 as Option B at one hundred percent (100%), and then died. 
(3)  Participant Death After Early Retirement Age; Payment Upon Death. If the Participant dies after attaining Early Retirement Age as defined in the Employer's Adoption Agreement, and if benefit payments commence to a Beneficiary (Primary Beneficiary, Secondary Beneficiary, or Default Beneficiary, as applicable) on the first day of the month coinciding with or immediately following the date of the Participant's death, then the monthly death benefit payable to said Beneficiary shall be the monthly benefit that would have otherwise been payable to the Participant, assuming the Participant: (i) retired on the date of death, and (ii) elected the optional form of Retirement payment designated in Section 7.03 as Option B at one hundred percent (100%), and then died. 
(4)  Participant Death After Early Retirement Age; Deferred Payment by Spouse. If the Participant dies after attaining Early Retirement Age as defined in the Employer's Adoption Agreement, and if a Spouse who is eligible to receive the in-service death benefit hereunder defers payment in accordance with this Section, then the monthly benefit payable to the Spouse Beneficiary shall be the monthly Retirement benefit that would have otherwise been payable to the Participant, assuming that the Participant: (i) terminated employment on his date of death; (ii) survived until the date upon which the deferred benefit payments commence in accordance with the Spouse Beneficiary's selected commencement date, and (ii) elected to retire on the benefit commencement date with the optional form of Retirement payment designated in Section 7.03 as Option B at one hundred percent (100%), and then died. 
Section 8.04. - Designation of Primary and Secondary Pre-Retirement Beneficiary. 
Upon completing the minimum Service and other eligibility requirements to be entitled to a pre-retirement in-service death benefit, a Participant may designate, on an Applicable Form provided for that purpose, one person as his Primary Pre-Retirement Beneficiary. The Primary Pre-Retirement Beneficiary shall receive the monthly pre-retirement death benefit elected by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement in the event that the Participant's employment with the Employer is terminated by reason of the Participant's death prior to his Retirement, provided the Primary Beneficiary survives the Participant by at least thirty-two (32) days in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 47-1-15 (a copy of which is included in the Appendix hereto). The Participant may additionally designate, on an Applicable Form provided for that purpose, one person as his Secondary Pre-Retirement Beneficiary. The monthly death benefit otherwise payable to the Primary Pre-Retirement Beneficiary hereunder shall be payable to the Participant's designated Secondary Pre-Retirement Beneficiary in the event that: (1) the Participant's employment with the Employer is terminated by reason of the Participant's death prior to his Retirement; (2) the Primary Pre-Retirement Beneficiary does not survive the Participant by at least thirty-two (32) days; and (3) the Secondary Pre-Retirement Beneficiary survives the Participant by at least thirty-two (32) days. 
Section 8.05. - Change of Beneficiary. 
Designation of a Primary or Secondary Pre-Retirement Beneficiary may be changed by the Participant in writing on an Applicable Form provided for that purpose at any time prior to Retirement. Only the last such designation prior to Retirement shall have effect and any new designation of a Primary or Secondary Pre-Retirement Beneficiary invalidates, supersedes, and revokes any prior designation. 
Section 8.06. - Default Beneficiary. 
In the absence of a designation by the Participant, or if there is no Primary or Secondary Pre-Retirement Beneficiary to whom a pre-retirement death benefit is payable under this Article, then the pre-retirement death benefit shall be paid to the Participant's surviving Default Beneficiary in accordance with this Section. For purposes of this Section, the Participant's Default Beneficiary(ies) shall be as follows: (a) the Participant's surviving Spouse; or (b) if there is no surviving Spouse, the Participant's surviving Children; or (c) if there is no surviving Spouse or Children, the Participant's surviving Parent(s). For purposes of this Section, the term "surviving" shall mean surviving the Participant by at least thirty-two (32) days. For purposes of this Section, the term "Spouse" shall be as defined in Section 2.59. The term "Child" or "Children" shall be as defined in Section 2.10. The term "Parent" shall be as defined in O.C.G.A. § 19-11-3(7), determined as of the date of the Participant's death. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, if a death benefit becomes payable to more than one Child of the Participant under this Section, then such benefit shall be paid to each such Child and calculated in a manner to provide each Child with an equal monthly benefit which ceases on the date such child reaches age twenty-two (22). Such benefit shall be calculated using the factors contained in Section 12.07. If a death benefit is payable to more than one surviving Parent of the Participant under this Section, then such benefit shall be calculated in a manner to provide each such Parent with the same monthly benefit amount for his or her lifetime. If a child who is receiving a monthly benefit hereunder reaches age twenty-two (22) or if a child or Parent receiving a monthly benefit hereunder dies, this shall not affect the monthly benefit amount any other child or Parent is receiving. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.07, if there is no Primary, Secondary, or Default Beneficiary to whom a death benefit is payable, then no death benefit is payable under the Plan. 
Section 8.07. - Actuarial Reserve In-Service Death Benefit; Payment to Estate. 
With respect to the Actuarial Reserve in-service death benefit only, if there is no Primary, Secondary or Default Pre-Retirement Beneficiary to whom a death benefit is payable under Section 8.06, then the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant's vested Accrued Retirement Benefit shall be paid to the Participant's estate in lieu of the lifetime monthly benefit which would otherwise be payable to a Pre-Retirement Beneficiary. Such Actuarial Equivalent shall be determined as if the Participant had terminated employment on the date immediately preceding his date of death and received a lump sum distribution of his benefit under Section 7.05, determined without reference to the maximum cash-out limits of said Section. 
Section 8.08. - Terminated Vested Death Benefits. 
If the Employer elects in the Adoption Agreement to provide a death benefit for Terminated Participants or for certain classes of Terminated Participants, then in the event such a terminated vested Participant dies before his effective Retirement Date, there shall be paid to his Pre-Retirement Beneficiary (Primary, Secondary, or Default Pre-Retirement Beneficiary, as applicable) the terminated vested death benefit specified in the Adoption Agreement, provided the requirements of this Article are satisfied. 
Section 8.09. - Terminated Vested Auto A Death Benefit. 
The Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to provide the Auto A Death Benefit for one or more classes of Terminated Participants. In such case, the Employer shall designate in the Adoption Agreement the minimum Service and other eligibility requirements a Terminated Participant must satisfy in order to be entitled to such benefit. Provided a Terminated Participant satisfies such requirements, then in the event that the Terminated Participant dies prior to his effective Retirement date, his Pre-Retirement Beneficiary may apply to receive a lifetime monthly death benefit subject to the provisions of this Section. If the Terminated Participant's Pre-Retirement Beneficiary is the Terminated Participant's Spouse, then the lifetime monthly death benefit payable to the Spouse Beneficiary under this Section shall commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or immediately following the date of the Terminated Participant's death. Alternatively, the Spouse Beneficiary may elect to defer benefit payment commencement until the first day of any month up to and including the date the Participant would have attained Normal Retirement Age as determined under the Employer's Adoption Agreement. For purposes of this Section, the term "Spouse" or "Spouse Beneficiary" shall be as defined in Section 2.59. A Spouse Beneficiary shall be considered to have deferred benefit payment commencement until the first day of the month following the date the Spouse makes application for payment of death benefits. If the designated and surviving Pre-Retirement Beneficiary is not the Spouse of the Terminated Participant, then the lifetime monthly death benefit payable to the Beneficiary under this Section shall commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or immediately following the date of the Terminated Participant's death. Benefits under this Section shall be computed as follows: 
(a)  Terminated Participant Death Before Early Retirement Age; Payment Before Early Retirement Age. If a Terminated Participant dies before attaining Early Retirement Age as defined in the Adoption Agreement, and if benefit payments commence to a Spouse Beneficiary or non-spouse Beneficiary before the Terminated Participant would have attained Early Retirement Age, then the monthly death benefit payable to the Beneficiary shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the monthly Retirement benefit amount that would have otherwise been payable to the Terminated Participant, assuming: (i) the Terminated Participant survived until Normal Retirement Age; and (ii) the Terminated Participant elected the optional form of Retirement payment designated herein as Option A at one hundred percent (100%), and then died. Said benefit shall be calculated in accordance with the actuarial assumptions specified in Section 12.07. 
(b)  Terminated Participant Death Before Early Retirement Age; Deferred Payment by Spouse Until After Early Retirement Age. If the Terminated Participant dies before attaining Early Retirement Age as defined in the Adoption Agreement and a Spouse Beneficiary defers payment until a date which is on or after the date the Terminated Participant would have attained Early Retirement Age, then the monthly death benefit payable to the Spouse Beneficiary shall be the monthly Retirement benefit that would have otherwise been payable to the Terminated Participant, assuming that: (i) the Terminated Participant survived until the date upon which the deferred benefit payments commence in accordance with the Spouse Beneficiary's selected benefit commencement date; and, (ii) the Terminated Participant elected on such date to retire with the optional form of Retirement payment designated herein as Option A at one hundred percent (100%), and then died. 
(c)  Terminated Participant Death After Early Retirement Age; Payment Upon Death. If the Terminated Participant dies after attaining Early Retirement Age as defined in the Adoption Agreement, and if benefit payments commence to a Spouse Beneficiary or non-spouse Beneficiary on the first day of the month coinciding with or immediately following the date of the Terminated Participant's death, then the monthly death benefit payable to the Beneficiary shall be the monthly benefit that would have otherwise been payable to the Terminated Participant, assuming: (i) the Terminated Participant retired on the date of death, and (ii) the Terminated Participant elected the optional form of Retirement payment designated herein as Option A at one hundred percent (100%), and then died. 
(d)  Terminated Participant Death After Early Retirement Age; Deferred Payment by Spouse. If the Terminated Participant dies after attaining Early Retirement Age, and if a Spouse Beneficiary defers payment in accordance with this Section, then the monthly benefit payable to the Spouse Beneficiary shall be the monthly Retirement benefit that would have otherwise been payable to the Terminated Participant, assuming that: (i) the Terminated Participant survived until the date upon which the deferred benefit payments commence in accordance with the Spouse Beneficiary's selected commencement date, and (ii) the Terminated Participant elected to retire on such date with the optional form of Retirement payment designated herein as Option A at one hundred percent (100%), and then died. 
(e)  Calculation of Benefits. Benefits under this Section shall be calculated taking into account only the Participant's Total Credited Service and Final Average Earnings (where applicable) as of the date of his Termination of Employment with Adopting Employer, and the applicable benefit formula in effect on the date of said Termination. 
Section 8.10. - Accrued Retirement Benefit. 
The Employer may elect in the Adoption Agreement to provide a death benefit consisting of the Accrued Retirement Benefit for one or more classes of Terminated Participants. In such case, the Employer shall designate the minimum Service and other eligibility requirements a Terminated Participant must satisfy in order to be entitled to such benefit. Provided a Terminated Participant satisfies such requirements, then in the event that the Terminated Participant dies prior to his effective Retirement date, his Pre-Retirement Beneficiary may apply to receive a lifetime monthly death benefit subject to the provisions of this Section. Said benefit shall commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or immediately following the date of the Terminated Participant's death. The monthly death benefit payable to the Participant's Pre-Retirement Beneficiary shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the Terminated Participant's death, taking into account the Participant's Total Credited Service, Final Average Earnings, and the benefit formula in effect as of the date of the Participant's Termination. 
Section 8.11. - Designation of Terminated Vested Pre-Retirement Beneficiary. 
The Primary and Secondary Pre-Retirement Beneficiary designated by the Participant to receive in-service death benefits under this Section 8.04 shall automatically be considered the Participant's Primary and Secondary Pre-Retirement Beneficiary for purposes of payment of terminated vested pre-retirement death benefits, if any, under the Employer's Plan. If the Participant changes his beneficiary designation in accordance with Section 8.05, his designation under this Section shall be considered changed as well to reflect the new designation. In the absence of a designation by the Participant, or if there is no Primary or Secondary Pre-Retirement Beneficiary to whom a terminated vested pre-retirement death benefit is payable upon the Participant's death, then the terminated vested pre-retirement death benefit otherwise payable, if any, shall be paid to the Participant's Default Beneficiary in accordance with Section 8.06. If there is no Primary, Secondary, or Default Pre-Retirement Beneficiary to whom a death benefit is payable, then no death benefit is payable under the Plan. 
Section 8.12. - Participant Death After Retirement Benefit Commencement. 
Upon the death of a Retired Participant subsequent to his Retirement, there shall be payable to the Participant's designated Post-Retirement Beneficiary, a benefit to be determined as follows: 
(a)  If the Participant has elected a form of payment that does not permit designation of a Post-Retirement Beneficiary (Option A or Option E), as provided in Article VII, or if he has elected a form of payment that does permit such designation (Option B, C, or D) and his designated Post-Retirement Beneficiary does not survive him, no further payment of any kind whatsoever shall be made at the death of the Participant. 
(b)  If the Participant has elected a form of payment that permits designation of a Post-Retirement Beneficiary (Option B, C, or D) as provided in Article VII, and his designated Post-Retirement Beneficiary survives him, benefits shall be payable to the Post-Retirement Beneficiary as provided by the option elected, commencing the month following the Participant's last benefit payment month. 
ARTICLE IX. - TERMINATION BEFORE RETIREMENT; VESTING 

Section 9.01. - Vesting Requirement for Deferred Retirement Benefit. 
An Employer may establish different vesting requirements for different classes of Eligible Employees in the Adoption Agreement. A Participant whose employment is terminated for any reason other than death or Retirement shall be entitled to a Vested right in his Accrued Benefit only if he meets the Qualifications for a deferred Vested Retirement benefit specified in the Adoption Agreement. Payment of such Vested Retirement Benefit shall commence on the last day of the month in which his effective Retirement Date occurs and shall be payable on the last day of each month thereafter during the lifetime of the Participant, unless the Participant elects an optional form of benefit payment under Article VII. The amount of such Monthly Retirement Benefit shall be computed in the manner prescribed for Normal or Early Retirement in Article VI, as applicable, but based upon the Participant's Final Average Earnings (if applicable) and Total Credited Service up to the Participant's date of Termination of Employment with the Adopting Employer. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, if a Participant has satisfied the requirements for Normal Retirement as of the date of his Termination, the Participant shall be one hundred percent (100%) Vested in his Normal Retirement benefit. Effective November 1, 2007, all references in this Section to "last day" shall be changed to "first day." 
Section 9.02. - Termination of Tenure of Office Before Retirement. 
Unless otherwise specified by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement, a Participant who is an elected or appointed member of the Governing Authority or a Municipal Legal Officer, and who vacates office for any reason other than death or Retirement shall be entitled to a Vested right in his Accrued Benefit only if he meets the Qualifications for a deferred Vested Retirement benefit applicable to elected or appointed members of the Governing Authority and Municipal Legal Officers as specified in the Adoption Agreement. A Participant who is an elected or appointed member of the Governing Authority or a Municipal Legal Officer and who has Credited Service as an Eligible Regular Employee of the Adopting Employer, shall have a Vested Right to his Credited Service both as an Eligible Regular Employee and as an elected or appointed member of the Governing Authority or a Municipal Legal Officer, provided he has completed the minimum service requirement for Vesting applicable to Eligible Regular Employees designated by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement. If his Total Credited Service is less than said minimum, the Participant's Vested Right shall be determined based only on his Total Credited Service as an elected or appointed member of the Governing Authority or his tenure of office as a Municipal Legal Officer and the vesting schedule applicable to Eligible Employees in said class. 
Section 9.03. - Immediate Vesting in Disability Retirement Benefit. 
If the Employer elects in the Adoption Agreement to provide Disability benefits, and unless otherwise specified in the Adoption Agreement, a Participant who is Disabled and otherwise meets the Plan's eligibility requirements for payment of a Disability Retirement Benefit shall be considered 100% Vested in such benefit. 
Section 9.04. - Involuntary Termination Without Cause. 
Notwithstanding any more restrictive vesting requirement imposed by the Employer in the Adoption Agreement, a Participant whose employment is terminated involuntarily and without cause shall be entitled to a Vested Benefit if he has completed five (5) years of Total Credited Service. For the purpose of this condition, "cause" for dismissal shall mean negligence or inefficiency in performing the duties of the position held, unfitness to perform assigned duties, insubordination, or misconduct reflecting discredit on the Adopting Employer or upon the Governing Authority. 
Section 9.05. - Portability Between Adopting Employers. 
(a)  This Section applies to a Participant, other than an elected or appointed member of the Governing Authority or Municipal Legal Officer, whose employment is terminated either voluntarily or involuntarily for any reason other than death or Retirement, after participation in the Plan. 
(b)  Subject to any limitations or conditions contained in the Employer's Adoption Agreement, in determining whether a Participant has satisfied the minimum service requirements for Vesting and the Service requirements for Retirement eligibility under the Adoption Agreement of any GMEBS Adopting Employer, the Participant's Total Credited Service with all other of the Participant's past and future Adopting Employers shall be taken into account. In no event, however, shall service with one GMEBS Employer be used to calculate the benefit amount due the Participant from another GMEBS Employer. Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.02(b)(7) concerning immediate participation for Participants who transfer from one GMEBS Employer to another, Service with one GMEBS Adopting Employer may not be used to establish participation in another Adopting Employer's plan. 
Section 9.06. - Forfeiture of Benefits for Public-Employment Related Crimes, Other Crimes. 
(a)  Benefits otherwise payable under the Plan shall be forfeited upon final conviction for a public employment-related crime or final conviction for a drug-related crime, in accordance with and subject to the applicable provisions of O.C.G.A. § 47-1-20 through 47-1-23 (a copy of which is included in the Appendix hereto). The terms of O.C.G.A. § 47-1-20 et seq. are incorporated herein by reference, including any future amendments thereto. 
(b)  Survivor benefits or refunds otherwise payable to a person upon the death of a Participant, Terminated Participant, Retired Participant, or Beneficiary shall be forfeited if the person commits or conspires to commit murder or involuntary manslaughter against a Participant, Terminated Participant, Retired Participant, or Beneficiary, in accordance with and subject to the applicable provisions of O.C.G.A. § 47-1-24 (a copy of which is included in the Appendix hereto). The terms of said code section are incorporated herein by reference, including any future amendments thereto. 
(c)  If the Adopting Employer receives information that a Participant, Terminated Participant, Retired Participant or Beneficiary has been convicted of any crime referenced in this Section which could potentially result in forfeiture of benefits, the Adopting Employer shall notify the Administrator when it receives notice of such conviction. 
Section 9.07. - Forfeitures. 
Forfeitures arising from Termination of Employment, withdrawal or any other reason may not be applied to increase the benefits any individual would otherwise receive under the Plan. However, forfeitures will remain Trust assets, and as such, may be used to reduce an Adopting Employer's contribution. 
ARTICLE X. - DISTRIBUTION AND ROLLOVER RULES 

Section 10.01. - Distribution Rules Imposed by Federal Law. 
Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, any distribution under the Plan shall be made in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(9) and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, including the incidental benefit rules under Code Section 401(a)(9)(G), and shall comply with the following rules: 
(a)  With respect to distributions under the Plan made for calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, the Plan shall apply the minimum distribution requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) in accordance with the Final Regulations under Code Section 401(a)(9) that were issued on April 17, 2002, and June 15, 2004, notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary. GMEBS is coordinating the compliance with the Final Regulations to comply with the good faith reasonable standard of PPA Section 823. 
(b)  Participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the Participant no later than the Participant's required beginning date. For purposes of this Section, "required beginning date" means April 1 of the calendar year following the later of (i) the calendar year in which the Participant reaches age seventy and one-half (70 1/2), or (ii) the calendar year in which the Participant Retires. 
(c)  If the Participant dies before distributions begin, the Participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
(1)  If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age seventy and one-half (70 1/2), if later. 
(2)  If the Participant's surviving spouse is not the Participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died, over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding: 
(A)  Unless the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the Participant's death; or 
(B)  If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
(3)  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant's death, the Participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death. 
(4)  If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (c), other than (c)(1), will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant. 
If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the Participant before the Participant's required beginning date (or to the Participant's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under this subsection (c)), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(d)  The amount that must be distributed on or before the Participant's required beginning date (or, if the Participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under subsection (c)) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the Participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the Participant's required beginning date. 
(e)  Any additional benefits accruing to the Participant in a calendar year after the first distribution year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(f)  If the Participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the Participant and a non-spouse beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the Participant's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the Participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the Participant using the applicable table set forth in the Treasury Regulations. If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the Participant and a non-spouse beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the designated beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain. 
(g)  Unless the Participant's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the Participant's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the Participant under applicable simple life table set forth in the Treasury Regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the Participant reaches age seventy (70), the applicable distribution period for the Participant is the distribution period for age seventy (70) under the applicable single life table as set forth in the Treasury Regulations plus the excess of seventy (70) over the age of the Participant as of the Participant's birthday in the year that contains the annuity starting date. If the Participant's spouse is the Participant's sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the Participant's applicable distribution period, as determined under this Section, or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the Participant and the Participant's spouse as determined under the applicable joint life table set forth in the Treasury Regulations, using the Participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the Participant's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. 
Section 10.02. - Rollover of Distributions. 
Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a Distributee's election under this Section, a Distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Administrator, to have any portion of an Eligible Rollover Distribution paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Distributee in a Direct Rollover. The following definitions shall apply to this Section: 
(a)  An "Eligible Rollover Distribution" is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the Distributee, except that an Eligible Rollover Distribution does not include: (i) any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the Distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the Distributee and the Distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; (ii) any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Code Section 401(a)(9); (iii) the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income; or (iv) any other distributions which the Internal Revenue Service does not consider eligible for rollover treatment, such as certain corrective distributions necessary to comply with the provisions of Code Section 402(g) or 415. Effective January 1, 2002, an Eligible Rollover Distribution also includes a distribution to a surviving spouse. Effective January 1, 2002, a portion of a distribution will not fail to be an Eligible Rollover Distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax Employee Contributions that are not includible in gross income. 
(b)  An "Eligible Retirement Plan" is any one of the following that accepts the Distributee's Eligible Rollover Distribution: (i) an individual retirement account described in Code Section 408(a); (ii) an individual retirement annuity described in Code Section 408(b); (iii) an annuity plan described in Code Section 403(a); or (iv) a qualified trust described in Code Section 401(a). Effective for distributions made after December 31, 2001, an Eligible Retirement Plan will also include an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Code Section 457(b) which is maintained by an eligible employer described in Code Section 457(e)(1)(A) or an annuity plan described in Code Section 403(b), and effective for distributions made after December 31, 2007, an Eligible Retirement Plan will also include a Roth IRA described in Code Section 408A. The portion of an Eligible Rollover Distribution that is not includible in gross income may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity described in Code Sections 408(a) or 408(b), a qualified defined contribution plan described in Code Section 401(a), a qualified plan described in Code Section 403(a), or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Code Section 401(a) or an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. 
(c)  A "Distributee" includes an employee or former employee. A Distributee also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse. Effective January 1, 2008, a Distributee further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Code Section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a nonspouse beneficiary may only make a direct rollover of the distribution to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution, and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
(d)  A "Direct Rollover" is a payment by the Plan to the Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Distributee. 
(e)  Notwithstanding subsection (a), if an Eligible Rollover Distribution is expected to total less than Two Hundred Dollars ($200) during a year, such payment may not be directly rolled over. 
Section 10.03. - Acceptance of Eligible Rollover Distributions. 
To the extent permitted by the applicable provisions of the Code and regulations issued thereunder, for the purpose of purchasing Credited Service as permitted under the Plan and the Employer's Adoption Agreement (i) a Participant may contribute to the Plan as a rollover contribution a qualified rollover amount from a qualified plan under Code Section 401(a), an annuity plan under Code Section 403(a), an individual retirement account or annuity under Code Sections 408(a) or (b), a governmental deferred compensation plan under Code Section 457(b), or a tax-sheltered annuity under Code Section 403(b), that is includible in taxable income; or (ii) effective as of June 24, 2009, a Participant may make a direct rollover to the Plan of a qualified rollover amount from a qualified plan under Code Section 401(a) consisting of after-tax employee contributions that is not includible in taxable income provided that such amount will be separately accounted for under the Plan; provided, further, that the Administrator, in its discretion, determines that the contribution satisfies all applicable requirements of the Code. Such rollovers will be allowed to the extent permitted by law, subject to any conditions, proofs, or acceptance the Administrator deems appropriate. 
Section 10.04. - Acceptance of Trustee-to-Trustee Transfers. 
A Participant may make a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer from a governmental deferred compensation plan under Code Section 457(b) or a tax-sheltered annuity under Code Section 403(b) for the purchase of permissive service credit, as defined in Code Section 415(n)(3)(A) and as permitted under the Plan and the Employer's Adoption Agreement, or for a repayment to which Code Section 415 does not apply by reason of Code Section 415(k)(3), as permitted under the Plan and the Employer's Adoption Agreement. Such transfers will be allowed to the extent permitted by law, subject to any conditions, proofs, or acceptance the Administrator deems appropriate. 
ARTICLE XI. - LIMITATIONS ON BENEFITS 

Section 11.01. - Effective Date. 
The Plan shall be administered so as to comply with this Article for limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, except as otherwise provided herein. 
Section 11.02. - Limitation on Annual Benefit. 
(a)  In no event shall the aggregate annual benefit for a calendar year (the "limitation year") provided under this Plan and all other defined benefit plans (without regard to whether the plan has terminated) of the Employer for any Participant exceed an amount equal to One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000) as adjusted pursuant to Code Section 415(d)(1)(A). 
(b)  Adjustment for Benefits Commencing Before Age 62. 
(1)  If the retirement income benefit under the Plan begins before age sixty-two (62) and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-two (62) and the age of benefit commencement, the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation for the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date that is the actuarial equivalent of the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation (adjusted under subsection (h) for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using a five percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table for the retirement income benefit commencement date (expressing the Participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the retirement income benefit commencement date). 
(2)  If the retirement income benefit under the Plan begins before age sixty-two (62) and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan has an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-two (62) and the age of benefit commencement, the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation for the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date is the lesser of the limitation determined under paragraph (1) and the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation (adjusted under subsection (h) for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at age sixty-two (62), both determined without applying the limitations of this Article. 
(3)  If the retirement income benefit under the Plan begins before age sixty-two (62) and occurs in a limitation year that begins on or after January 1, 2002, but prior to July 1, 2007, the determination as to whether the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000) limitation has been satisfied shall be made by reducing the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000) limitation so that such limitation (as so reduced) equals an annual benefit (beginning when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000) annual benefit beginning at age sixty-two (62). The age reduced dollar limit shall be the lesser of the equivalent amount computed using the actuarial table in Section 12.01 of the Plan for actuarial equivalence for early retirement benefits, and the amount computed using five percent (5%) interest and the applicable mortality table (to the extent that the mortality decrement is used prior to age sixty-two (62)). 
(c)  Adjustment for Benefits Commencing After Age 65. 
(1)  If the retirement income benefit under the Plan begins after age sixty-five (65) and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-five (65) and the age of benefit commencement, the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation at the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date that is the actuarial equivalent of the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation (adjusted under subsection (h) for years of participation less than ten (10), if required), with actuarial equivalence computed using a five percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table for that retirement income benefit commencement date as defined in Section 2.02 of the Plan (expressing the Participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the retirement income benefit commencement date). 
(2)  If the retirement income benefit under the Plan begins after age sixty-five (65) and occurs in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, and the Plan has an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-five (65) and the age of benefit commencement, the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation at the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date is the lesser of the limitation determined under paragraph (1) and the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation (adjusted under subsection (h) for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at age sixty-five (65), both determined without applying the limitations of this Article. For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date is the annual amount of such annuity payable to the Participant, computed disregarding the Participant's accruals after age sixty-five (65) but including actuarial adjustments even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under the Plan at age sixty-five (65) is the annual amount of such annuity that would be payable under the Plan to a hypothetical Participant who is age sixty-five (65) and has the same accrued benefit as the Participant. 
(3)  If the retirement income benefit under the Plan begins after age sixty-five (65) and occurs in a limitation year that begins on or after January 1, 2002, but prior to July 1, 2007, the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation for the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date is the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date that is the actuarial equivalent of the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation (adjusted under subsection (h) for years of participation less than ten (10), if required) with actuarial equivalence computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount: (i) the actuarial increase factors specified in Section 12.06 of the Plan; or (ii) a five percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table as defined in Section 2.02 of the Plan. 
(d)  Notwithstanding the other requirements of this section, in adjusting the dollar limitation for the Participant's retirement income benefit commencement date under subsection (b) or (c), as applicable, no adjustment shall be made to the One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollar ($160,000) limitation to reflect the probability of a Participant's death between the retirement income benefit commencement date and age sixty-two (62), or between age sixty-five (65) and the retirement income benefit commencement date, as applicable, if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the Participant prior to the retirement income benefit commencement. To the extent benefits are forfeited upon death before the retirement income benefit commencement date, such an adjustment shall be made. Furthermore, notwithstanding the requirements of this section, the adjustments provided for in subsections (b) and (c) shall not apply (i) in the event the Participant's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of service as a full-time employee of any police or fire department or on fifteen (15) years of military service, or (ii) in the case of pre-retirement disability benefits or pre-retirement death benefits. 
(e)  Adjustment for Form Subject to Code Section 417(e)(3). For distributions made in any form other than a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity to which Code Section 417(e)(3) does not apply [a monthly benefit], such benefit shall be adjusted to a straight life annuity, beginning at the same age, which is the actuarial equivalent of such benefit. 
(1)  For limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity for purposes of applying the limitations under Code Section 415(b) to benefits is equal to the greater of (or the reduced limitation applicable at the retirement income benefit commencement date which is the "lesser of" when adjusted in accordance with the following assumptions): 
(A)  The equivalent annual benefit computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in Article XII of the Plan for actuarial equivalence for the particular form of benefit payable, and 
(B)  The equivalent annual benefit computed using a five percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table described in Internal Revenue Service guidance (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 98-1 prior to 2003 or Revenue Ruling 2001-62 on or after January 1, 2003). 
(2)  For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the greater of (or the reduced limitation applicable at the retirement income benefit commencement date which is the "lesser of" when adjusted in accordance with the following assumptions): 
(A)  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the Participant under the Plan commencing at the same retirement income benefit commencement date as the Participant's form of benefit; and 
(B)  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same retirement income benefit commencement date that has the same actuarial present value as the Participant's form of benefit, computed using a five percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table described in Internal Revenue Service guidance (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 on or after January 1, 2003, or Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008-85 for years after December 31, 2008). 
(f)  Adjustment for Form Not Subject to Code Section 417(e)(3). As required by final Treasury Regulations, for distributions made in any form to which Code Section 417(e)(3) applies [a lump sum benefit], such benefit shall be adjusted to a straight life annuity, beginning at the same age, which is the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit which is the greatest of (or the reduced limitation applicable at the retirement income benefit commencement date which is the "least of" when adjusted in accordance with the following assumptions): 
(1)  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the retirement income benefit commencement date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in Article XII of the Plan for actuarial experience; 
(2)  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the retirement income benefit commencement date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a five and five-tenths percent (5.5%) interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and the applicable mortality table for the distribution under Internal Revenue Service guidance (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 98-1 prior to 2003, Revenue Ruling 2001-62 on or after January 1, 2003, or Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008-85 for years after December 31, 2008); or 
(3)  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the retirement income benefit commencement date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Internal Revenue Service guidance (the 30-year Treasury rate prior to January 1, 2008, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2008, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period) and the applicable mortality table for the distribution under Internal Revenue Service guidance (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 98-1 prior to 2003, Revenue Ruling 2001-62 on or after January 1, 2003, or Internal Revenue Service Notice 2008-85 for years after December 31, 2008), divided by one and five-one-hundredths (1.05). 
(g)  Limitations on benefits under this Article shall not apply where the total annual benefits payable to a Participant under this Plan and all other qualified defined benefit plans (whether or not terminated) of the Employer do not exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) in the aggregate. This minimum limitation is not applicable for a Participant whose Employer maintains or has maintained a defined contribution plan in which such Participant participated. 
(h)  The Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) minimum limitation, if provided, must be reduced where a Participant has less than ten (10) years of service with the Employer at the time the Participant begins to receive retirement benefits under the Plan, and the maximum dollar limitation must be reduced where a Participant has less than ten (10) years of participation when retirement benefits under the Plan commence. These adjustments are made by multiplying the applicable limitations by the appropriate fraction: 
(A)  For the Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000) minimum limitation — Years of service with the employer as of and including, the current limitation year divided by ten (10); or 
(B)  For the maximum dollar limitation — Years of participation with the employer as of and including, the current limitation year divided by ten (10). 
(i)  For purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (Limit), the following will apply: 
(1)  Prior to any limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007, adjustments under Section 6.05, will be taken into consideration when determining a Participant's applicable Limit; 
(2)  For any limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007: 
(A)  A Participant's applicable Limit will be applied to the Participant's annual benefit in the Participant's first limitation year without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments under Section 6.05; 
(B)  To the extent the Participant's benefit equals or exceeds the Limit, the Participant will no longer be eligible for cost of living adjustments under Section 6.05 until such time as the benefit plus the accumulated adjustments under Section 6.05 are less than the Limit; 
(C)  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a Participant's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases under Section 6.05, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit Limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(D)  In no event shall a Participant's benefit payable under the Plan in any limitation year be greater than the Limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. If the form of benefit without regard to the automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity, then the preceding provisions are applied by reducing the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the death benefits under the form of benefit. 
Section 11.03. - Limitation on Annual Additions. 
(a)  Effective beginning on and after January 1, 2002, to the extent required under Code Section 415(c), in no event shall the "annual addition" for a Participant for any calendar year (the "limitation year"), exceed the lesser of: 
(1)  Forty Thousand Dollars ($40,000)), as adjusted for increases in the cost of living under Code Section 415(d); or 
(2)  One hundred percent (100%)) of the "compensation" of such Participant received from an Adopting Employer during the limitation year. 
(b)  For purposes of this Section, "compensation" means all of a Participant's wages as defined in Code Section 3401(a) for the purposes of income tax withholding at the source but determined without regard to any rules that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2)); provided, however, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation shall also include the amount of any elective deferrals, as defined in Code Section 402(g)(3), and any amount contributed or deferred by the Adopting Employer at the election of the Employee and which is not includable in the gross income of the Employee by reason of Code Section 125 or 457, but shall exclude Employee contributions picked up under Code Section 414(h)(2). For limitations years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation shall also include any amount deferred by the Adopting Employer at the election of the Employee which is not includable in the gross income of the Employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the following types of payments, if paid by the later of (i) two and one-half (2 1/2) months following a Participant's Termination of Employment, or (ii) the last day of the limitation year that includes the Participant's Termination of Employment, will be included as compensation for purposes of this Section: payments that, absent a Termination of Employment, would have been paid to the Participant while he or she continued in employment and that are regular compensation for services rendered, and payments of accrued bona fide sick, vacation, or other leave, but only if the Participant would have been able to use the leave if employment had continued. Any payments not described in the preceding sentence are not considered compensation if paid after severance from employment, even if they are paid within two and one-half (2 1/2) months following severance from employment, except for payments to the individual who does not currently perform services for the Employer by reason of qualified military service (within the meaning of Code Section 414(u)(1)) to the extent these payments do not exceed the amounts the individual would have received if the individual had continued to perform services for the Employer rather than entering qualified military service. An Employee who is in qualified military service (within the meaning of Code Section 414(u)(1)) shall be treated as receiving compensation from the Employer during such period of qualified military service equal to (i) the compensation the Employee would have received during such period if the Employee were not in qualified military service, determined based on the rate of pay the Employee would have received from the Employer but for the absence during the period of qualified military service, or (ii) if the compensation the Employee would have received during such period was not reasonably certain, the Employee's average compensation from the Employer during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the qualified military service (or, if shorter, the period of employment immediately preceding the qualified military service). For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, a Participant's compensation for purposes of this Section shall not exceed the annual limit under Code Section 401(a)(17). 
(c)  For purposes of this Section, "annual addition" means the sum of the following amounts credited to a Participant's accounts for the limitation year under this Plan and any other plan maintained by an Employer: (i) employer contributions; (ii) employee contributions; (iii) forfeitures; and (iv) allocations under a simplified employee pension plan. Amounts allocated after March 31, 1984, to an individual medical account, as defined in Code Section 415(1)(2), which is part of a pension or annuity plan maintained by an Employer are treated as annual additions to a defined contribution plan. Also, amounts derived from contributions paid or accrued after December 31, 1985, in taxable years ending after such date, which are attributable to post-retirement medical benefits, allocated to the separate account of a key employee, as defined in Code Section 419A(d)(3), under a welfare benefit fund, as defined in Code Section 419(e), maintained by an Employer are treated as an annual additions to a defined contribution plan. 
(d)  If the annual addition for a Participant under the Plan would be greater than the annual addition for such Participant as limited by subsection (a), then the excess shall be corrected as permitted under the IRS Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (currently set forth in Revenue Procedure 2008-50). 
Section 11.04. - Code Section 415(e) Limits. 
For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2000, any benefit limitations applied pursuant to Code Section 415(e) shall no longer apply for employees or former employees who are Participants with an accrued benefit under the Plan on or after January 1, 2000. 
Section 11.05. - Limitations on Service Credit Purchases. 
(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, if an Adopting Employer adopts an Addendum to the Adoption Agreement that provides for service credit purchases, the Administrator may modify a request by a Participant to make an Employee Contribution if the amount of the Contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods: 
(1)  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the Administrator may establish a periodic payment plan for the Participant to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
(2)  If payment pursuant to paragraph (1) will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the Administrator may either reduce the Employee Contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the Participant's Contribution. 
(b)  Effective for any permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a Participant makes one (1) or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under an Adopting Employer's Plan, then the requirements of this Section will be treated as met only if: 
(1)  The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such Contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b), or 
(2)  The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such Contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c), 
(3)  For purposes of applying paragraph (1), the Plan will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this paragraph (3), and for purposes of applying paragraph (2), the Plan will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Code Section 415(c)(1)(B) solely by reason of this subsection (b), 
(4)  For purposes of this subsection (b) the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
(A)  Recognized by the Plan for purposes of calculating a Participant's benefit under the Plan, 
(B)  Which such Participant has not received under the Plan, and 
(C)  Which such Participant may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the Plan, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding subparagraph (B), may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a Participant is receiving under the Plan. 
(5)  The Plan will fail to meet the requirements of this subsection (b) if; 
(A)  More than five (5) years of nonqualified service credit are taken into account for purposes of this paragraph (5), or 
(B)  Any nonqualified service credit is taken into account under this subsection (b) before the Participant has at least five (5) years of participation under the Plan. 
(6)  For purposes of paragraph (5), effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, the term "nonqualified service credit" means permissive service credit other than that allowed with respect to; 
(A)  Service (including parental, medical, sabbatical, and similar leave) as an employee of the Government of the United States, any State or political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing (other than military service or service for credit which was obtained as a result of a repayment described in Code Section 415(k)(3)), 
(B)  Service (including parental, medical, sabbatical, and similar leave) as an employee (other than as an employee described in subparagraph (A)) of an education organization described in Code Section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) which is a public, private, or sectarian school which provides elementary or secondary education (through grade 12), or a comparable level of education, as determined under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the service was performed, 
(C)  Service as an employee of an association of employees who are described in subparagraph (A), or 
(D)  Military service (other than qualified military service under Code Section 414(u)) recognized by such governmental plan. 
In the case of service described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C), such service will be nonqualified service if recognition of such service would cause a Participant to receive a retirement benefit for the same service under more than one Plan. 
(7)  In the case of a trustee-to-trustee transfer after December 31, 2001, to which Code Section 403(b)(13)(A) or 457(e)(17)(A) applies (without regard to whether the transfer is made between plans maintained by the same employer)— 
(A)  The limitations of paragraph (6) will not apply in determining whether the transfer is for the purchase of permissive service credit, and 
(B)  The distribution rules applicable under federal law to the Plan will apply to such amounts and any benefits attributable to such amounts. 
(8)  For an eligible Participant, the limitation of Code Section 415(c)(1) shall not be applied to reduce the amount of permissive service credit which may be purchased to an amount less than the amount which was allowed to be purchased under the terms of the Plan as in effect on August 5, 1997. For purposes of this paragraph (8), an eligible Participant is an individual who first became a Participant in the Plan before January 1, 1998. 
Section 11.06. - Interpretation of this Article. 
(a)  The annual additions and annual benefit of a Participant shall be adjusted pursuant to this Article so as to produce the maximum annual benefit and maximum annual additions permissible for such Participant. 
(b)  For purposes of this Section and subject to Code Section 415(h), all defined benefit plans of an Adopting Employer, whether or not terminated, are to be treated as a single defined benefit plan, and all defined contribution plans of an Adopting Employer are to be treated as a single defined contribution plan. However, Adopting Employers shall be considered as separate Employers in accordance with State law.

(c)  Upon the Participant's termination, the Pension Committee shall provide notice to the Participant of his opportunity to withdraw his Employee Contributions (including any Contributions made to purchase prior service credit, if permitted under the Adoption Agreement), and the Participant shall have sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice to submit a request for withdrawal on an Applicable Form provided for that purpose. Failure to make such a request within this sixty (60) day period shall result in the forfeiture of a vested Participant's right to request withdrawal upon termination and shall result in forfeiture of a non-vested Participant's right to the accrual of further interest. Unless otherwise specified in the Adoption Agreement, upon withdrawal of Employee Contributions (including any Contributions made to purchase prior service credit, if permitted under the Adoption Agreement) pursuant to this Section, the Participant shall forfeit for himself, his heirs and assigns all his rights, title, and interest in the Plan, except as provided in subsection (d) below.

If a Participant dies in the Service of an Adopting Employer before he satisfies the eligibility requirements for an in-service death benefit, his Employee Contributions plus interest posted thereon shall be paid to the Participant's estate. In the event the sum of all pre-retirement benefits paid to a Pre-Retirement Beneficiary(ies) by virtue of the death of a Participant or Terminated Participant, as applicable, do not equal or exceed the amount of the Participant's or Terminated Participant's Employee Contributions plus interest posted thereon, a lump sum payment in the amount of the difference shall be paid to the estate of the Pre-Retirement Beneficiary (or last surviving Pre-Retirement Beneficiary as applicable).

Section 15.09. - Fiduciary Insurance. 
The Board of Trustees may purchase fiduciary liability insurance for any of its fiduciaries, or for itself, to cover liability or losses occurring by reason of the act or omission of a fiduciary. 
ARTICLE XVI. - GMEBS TRUST AGREEMENT 
All contributions under the Plan shall be transferred to the Trust to be held, managed, invested, and distributed as part of the Trust Fund by the Board in accordance with the provisions of the Plan and GMEBS Trust Agreement. All benefits under the Plan shall be distributed solely from the Trust Fund. 
The Board shall distribute the corpus and income of the Trust Fund to the Participants and their Beneficiaries in accordance with applicable state and federal law and the Plan. At no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to Participants and their Beneficiaries shall any part of the corpus or income be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than the exclusive benefit of the Participants and their beneficiaries. 
ARTICLE XVII. - CLAIMS AND LITIGATION 

Section 17.01. - Disputes. 
In the event of disagreement between a Participant and the Adopting Employer with respect to any rights, claims, or responsibilities under the Plan which cannot be resolved by the Pension Committee as provided under Article XV, the Participant may make an appeal regarding such rights, claims, or responsibilities to the Governing Authority. In the event that any such rights, claims, or responsibilities result in a suit or other legal action by a Participant or Beneficiary, such action shall be defended in the same manner as other suits against the Adopting Employer. Any legal action on behalf of the Adopting Employer with regard to the Plan shall be first authorized by the Governing Authority and shall be conducted in the manner prescribed by the Governing Authority. GMEBS shall have no responsibility to defend or pursue legal action arising under the Plan. 
Section 17.02. - Disputes Involving Federal or State Law Compliance. 
In the event there is a dispute involving federal or state law compliance, between a Participant or Beneficiary and the Governing Authority or the Trustees, or between an Adopting Employer and the Trustees, GMEBS is a necessary party to any such dispute, or suit, settlement, or release arising therefrom. 
Section 17.03. - Failure to Act. 
GMEBS shall not be responsible for the failure of the Adopting Employers to perform any of their obligations under the Plan, including the duty to remit payments to GMEBS, to provide necessary records concerning Participants and their Earnings to GMEBS, or to perform any other functions required of the Adopting Employers by applicable law, the Master Plan, the Adoption Agreement, the GMEBS Trust Agreement, or by the rules and regulations of GMEBS. 
ARTICLE XVIII. - AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION 

Section 18.01. - Amendment of the Plan by an Adopting Employer. 
The Governing Authority shall have the right at any time, and from time to time, to amend, in whole or in part, any or all of its elections in the Adoption Agreement; provided, however, that no such amendment shall: 
(a)  Reduce the previously accrued benefits of any Participant or Beneficiary; or, 
(b)  Authorize or permit any part of the Trust Fund held by the Board to be diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of Participants and their Beneficiaries; or, 
(c)  Operate to deprive any Participant or Beneficiary of any rights or benefits irrevocably Vested in him under the Plan prior to such amendment, except that the Governing Authority may make any and all changes or modifications to the Adoption Agreement necessary to qualify the Plan or to keep the Plan qualified under the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder, or any amendment thereto; or, 
(d)  Become effective until approved by the Administrator. In order to be approved by the Administrator, any amendment must comply with all applicable state and federal laws and the Master Plan. If the Administrator does not approve an amendment, the Administrator shall continue to administer the Plan as if such amendment had not been made. 
In no event may an Adopting Employer amend the Master Plan or the GMEBS Trust Agreement. 
Section 18.02. - Amendment of Plan by GMEBS. 
The Board hereby reserves the right to amend the Master Plan or the elective provisions of the Adoption Agreement in its sole discretion without the consent of the Adopting Employers or of Participants (or any Beneficiaries thereof). Any modification, alteration, or amendment made in accordance with this Section may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate. A certified copy of the resolution of the Board making such amendment shall be delivered to the Administrator and the Adopting Employers. The Plan shall be amended in the manner and effective as of the date set forth in such resolution, and the Adopting Employers, Employees, Participants, Beneficiaries, the Administrator, and all others having any interest under the Plan shall be bound thereby. 
Section 18.03. - Amendment for Qualification of Plan. 
(a)  It is the intent of the Board that the Plan shall be and remain qualified for tax purposes under the Code. The Administrator shall promptly submit the Master Plan for approval under the Code and all expenses incident thereto shall be borne by the GMEBS Investment Fund. With the approval of the Board, the Practitioner may make any modifications, alterations, or amendments to the Master Plan, Adoption Agreement, or Addendum necessary to obtain and retain approval of the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate as may be necessary to establish and maintain the status of the Plan as qualified under the provisions of the Code or in compliance with other federal legislation, as now in effect or hereafter enacted, and the regulations issued thereunder. Any modification, alteration, or amendment of the Plan, made in accordance with this Section, may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate. A certified copy of the resolution of the Board approving such amendment shall be delivered to the Administrator and the Adopting Employers, and the Plan shall be amended in the manner and effective as of the date set forth in such resolution, and the Adopting Employers, Employees, Participants, beneficiaries, Administrator, and all others having any interest under the Plan shall be bound thereby. 
(b)  With the approval of the Board, on and after February 17, 2005, the Practitioner shall amend the Plan on behalf of all Adopting Employers, including those Adopting Employers who have adopted the Plan prior to this restatement of the Plan, for changes in the Code, the regulations thereunder, revenue rulings, other statements published by Internal Revenue Service, including model, sample, or other required good faith amendments (but only if their adoption will not cause such Plan to be individually designed), and for corrections of prior approved plans. These amendments shall be applied to all Adopting Employers. Employer notice and signature requirements have been met for all Adopting Employers before the effective date of February 17, 2005. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, the Practitioner shall no longer have the authority to amend the Plan on behalf of any Adopting Employer as of either: 
(1)  the date the Internal Revenue Service requires the Adopting Employer to file Form 5300 as an individually designed plan as a result of an amendment by the Adopting Employer to incorporate a type of Plan not allowable in a volume submitter plan; or 
(2)  as of the date of the Plan is otherwise considered an individually designed plan due to the nature and extent of the amendments. 
If the Adopting Employer is required to obtain a determination letter for any reason in order to maintain reliance on the advisory letter, the Practitioner's authority to amend the Plan on behalf of the Adopting Employer is conditioned on the Plan receiving a favorable determination letter. In any event, any amendment made by the Practitioner is subject to the approval of the Board. 
GMEBS will maintain or have maintained on behalf of the Practitioner, a record of the Participating Employers, and GMEBS on behalf of the Practitioner will make reasonable and diligent efforts to ensure that Adopting Employers have actually received and are aware of all Plan amendments and that such Adopting Employers adopt new documents when necessary. The provisions of this subsection shall supersede other provisions of the Plan to the extent those other provisions are inconsistent. 
Section 18.04. - Termination by Adopting Employer. 
(a)  The Adopting Employer expects the Plan to be continued indefinitely but, of necessity, reserves the right to terminate its Plan and Contributions thereunder at any time by action of the Governing Authority, subject to the Administrator's approval. Such termination shall be accomplished by the adoption of an ordinance or resolution (as applicable) by the Governing Authority terminating the Plan. Such ordinance shall conform to the rules and regulations of the Board governing Plan termination to the extent they are consistent with this provision. 
(b)  Upon termination, all Eligible Employees shall be deemed to be Participants, and the Accrued Benefits of such Participants shall be Vested to the extent funded. The Pension Committee shall notify Participants, Terminated Participants, Retired Participants, and Beneficiaries of the termination of the Plan, and shall provide a copy of such notice and the names and addresses of the persons notified to the Administrator. 
(c)  Upon termination, the Adopting Employer shall provide to the Administrator current Participant information necessary to calculate Accrued Benefits. Upon receipt of such information, the Administrator shall prepare a list of all the Adopting Employer's Participants, Retired Participants, Terminated Participants, and Beneficiaries, showing for each the present value of his Accrued Benefit, as determined by the GMEBS Actuary as of the date of termination. 
(d)  The Administrator, in accordance with the Board's current rules and regulations, and with generally accepted accounting practices, shall determine the value of the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund as of the termination date. All mandatory Employee Contributions, if any, plus interest, shall be paid from the Trust Fund to the Participants, to the extent of available Trust Fund assets. The Administrator shall then deduct from the Trust Fund a termination fee established by GMEBS for services provided in terminating the Plan. The Administrator, pursuant to the Board's rules and regulations, shall then allocate the remaining assets for distribution of the present value of Accrued Benefits in lump sums to the classes listed below. The benefits of each class shall be satisfied before proceeding to the next class. If at any time the remaining Plan assets would be insufficient to provide the present value of Accrued Benefits for the class in question, the remaining assets shall be applied on a pro rata basis within that class, and all subsequent classes shall receive no benefit. The pro rata allocation referred to above will be determined based upon the comparative value of each class member's Accrued Benefit (present value expressed in a lump sum) when measured against the lump sum present value of Accrued Benefits for the class as a whole. 
CLASS A — Retired Participants or Beneficiaries who are receiving payments as of the termination date. 
CLASS B — Participants delaying Retirement beyond the Normal Retirement Date. 
CLASS C — Participants eligible for Early Retirement. 
CLASS D — Other Participants, terminated or active, who have met the requirements for vesting as of the termination date. 
CLASS E — All other Participants on a pro rata basis. Payment of benefits to Retired Participants, Beneficiaries, and Participants by the Administrator as a result of a Plan termination shall be limited solely to the assets available in the Trust Fund. 
(e)  In its termination ordinance, the Governing Authority shall instruct the Administrator as to the distribution of excess assets, if any, remaining after the satisfaction of Accrued Benefits for the classes enumerated herein. In the absence of such instructions, any excess assets shall be distributed to the Adopting Employer. 
(f)  Upon distribution of the assets as specified above, the Adoption Agreement, Master Plan, and GMEBS Trust Agreement shall be regarded as terminated as to that Adopting Employer and no Participant or Beneficiary shall have any further rights or claim herein. 
Section 18.05. - Amendment of the Plan to Transfer Assets; Termination of Contract. 
(a)  The Adopting Employer may amend the Adoption Agreement by ordinance or resolution (as applicable) so as to provide for the transfer of assets to a successor trustee and to terminate the existing Contract between the Adopting Employer and the Board. Any such ordinance or resolution shall comply with Section 18.01 and with the requirements of the rules and regulations of the Board regarding amendment and transfer of Plan assets, to the extent they are consistent with this Section. 
(b)  In addition to other requirements, such ordinance or resolution shall: 
(1)  Designate a new trustee or trustees to replace the Board; 
(2)  Establish a month-end termination date, which shall be used for purposes of valuing the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund assets and which shall be fixed by the Administrator, taking into account the time reasonably required to liquidate GMEBS Retirement Trust Fund assets (if necessary) for purposes of the termination and transfer, the impact of the termination on the financial integrity of the Retirement System, and the time reasonably required for GMEBS and the terminating Employer to complete necessary administrative tasks associated with the termination. The termination date will be no earlier than forty-five (45) days after the Adopting Employer provides written notice to the Administrator of its intent to terminate; 
(3)  Provide that after the established termination date, GMEBS shall have no further responsibility or obligation to administer the terminating Employer's retirement plan, except as otherwise agreed and provided for by GMEBS and the terminating Employer in the ordinance or resolution; 
(4)  Provide that the value of assets of the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund as of the established termination date shall be determined based upon the value of the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund as reflected in the unaudited financial statements for the GMEBS Retirement Trust Fund as of the established termination date, subject to verification and reconciliation against the most recent GMEBS Retirement Trust Fund audit coinciding with or following the termination date. 
(5)  Provide for the transfer of assets held in the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund to the successor trustee as follows: 
(A)  That no transfer shall take place until a successor Code Section 401(a) retirement plan and trust document have been adopted by the Adopting Employer and furnished to GMEBS, together with a current IRS determination letter or an opinion letter from an attorney confirming that the successor retirement plan is tax qualified under Code Section 401(a); 
(B)  That as soon as reasonably practicable after the established termination date, the Administrator will make an initial transfer to the successor trustee of an amount to be determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion, but in no event more than eighty-five percent (85%) of the value of the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund, as reflected in the then most recently completed unaudited monthly financial statement for the GMEBS Retirement Trust Fund; and that prior to the completion of the initial transfer, the Administrator shall deduct from the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund a termination fee established by GMEBS for services provided in effecting the termination of the Adopting Employer's participation in GMEBS and the transfer of assets to the successor trustee; 
(C)  That as soon as reasonably practicable after completion of the GMEBS Retirement Fund unaudited financial statement for the month including the established termination date, the Administrator will make a second transfer to the successor trustee in an amount equal to the remainder of the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund assets, if any; and that in any event distribution of assets to the successor trustee shall be completed within the time limits specified in the GMEBS Trust Agreement; 
(D)  That after the established termination date, any funds remaining in the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund shall not share in the gains or losses of the GMEBS Retirement Trust Fund, notwithstanding any provision of the GMEBS Master Plan or Trust Agreement to the contrary; and that any investment gains or losses that would otherwise be credited to or debited from the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund after the established termination date shall not be taken into account. Rather, after the established termination date through completion of the transfer of assets, any amount remaining in the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund shall earn interest at the same rate as the GMEBS active cash management account which shall be credited monthly until the transfer of assets is completed; and, 
(E)  That if the audit of the GMEBS Retirement Trust Fund for the year including the established termination date reflects that the value of the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund on the termination date was understated or overstated in the unaudited financial statement relied upon, then GMEBS or the Adopting Employer shall remit to the other the amount of any overpayment or underpayment, unless said amount is less than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000). Such remittance shall be made in a lump sum with interest. Said interest shall be calculated at the same rate as the GMEBS active cash management account and credited monthly as of the last day of each month following the established termination date up until the date of the remittance. 
(6)  State that the existing retirement rights of Employees, Participants, and Beneficiaries shall not be impaired. 
(7)  Provide that upon completion of the transfer of assets, the GMEBS Board of Trustees shall have no further fiduciary responsibility for investment of the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund assets or payment of liabilities, and the Adopting Employer's Contract and participation under the GMEBS Trust Agreement shall be considered terminated. 
Section 18.06. - Involuntary Termination. 
(a)  The Board may involuntarily terminate the Plan as to an Adopting Employer in the event of any of the following occurrences: 
(1)  Failure of the Employer to comply with the terms of the Master Plan, Adoption Agreement, or GMEBS Trust Agreement including, but not limited to, failure to pay required Contributions in a timely manner; 
(2)  Receipt of written notice from an Adopting Employer's Governing Authority of its intent to discontinue further Contributions; 
(3)  Insistence by the Employer on enforcing an amendment to the Adoption Agreement which the Board has disapproved; or 
(4)  Failure of the Adopting Employer to maintain qualification status under Code Sections 401 (a) and 414(d). 
(b)  The rights, benefits, and entitlements under the Plan of any Participant, including those of his Beneficiary, any other provision of the Plan notwithstanding, before or after Retirement, death, or other termination of employment shall, upon the failure of the Adopting Employer to pay and to continue to pay its required Contributions, be limited as specified in this Article. 
(c)  In the event of an involuntary termination, the GMEBS Board may in its sole discretion adopt a resolution providing for: (i) designation of the members of the Employer's Governing Authority as successor trustees for the Plan; (ii) designation of a person or entity other than the Employer's Governing Authority as successor trustee for the Plan; or (iii) outright termination of the Plan and distribution of assets to Participants and Beneficiaries. The specific terms and conditions associated with involuntary termination shall be as provided in the Board resolution. 
(d)  The Administrator shall notify the Governing Authority, Participants, and Beneficiaries in writing of an involuntary termination and the reasons therefor. Said notice shall also fix a termination date. Upon the request of the Administrator, the Employer shall within a reasonable period provide the Administrator with the last known addresses of Participants and Beneficiaries for this purpose. 
(e)  The Administrator shall determine the value of the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund as of the termination date in accordance with the procedures described in Section 5(b)(4) of this Article. The Board shall deduct from the Trust Fund a termination fee established by GMESBS for services provided in effecting termination of the Adopting Employer's participation in GMEBS. 
(f)  Successor Trustee. 
(1)  Governing Authority as Successor Trustee. If upon voluntary termination, the GMEBS Board by resolution designates the members of the Employer's Governing Authority as successor trustees, the Adopting Employer shall be obligated to furnish GMEBS with a successor retirement plan and related documents as provided in Section 18.05(b)(5)(A). Distribution of assets to the Governing Authority or to a designee specified by the Governing Authority in writing, as successor trustee, shall then occur in accordance with the transfer procedures described in Section 18.05(b)(5). Payment of benefits to Retired Participants and Beneficiaries shall become the responsibility of the Governing Authority, as successor trustees, as of the termination date, except as otherwise provided in the Board's termination resolution. 
(2)  Other Entity as Successor Trustee. If upon involuntary termination, the GMEBS Board by resolution designates a successor trustee other than the members of the Employer's Governing Authority, distribution of assets to the successor trustee shall occur in accordance with the transfer procedures described in Section 18.05(b)(5) upon the Board's receipt of retirement plan and related documents as described in Section 18.05(b)(5)(A), and any other information reasonably requested by the Board. Payment of benefits to the Retired Participants and Beneficiaries shall become the responsibility of the successor trustee as of the termination date, except as otherwise provided in the Board's termination resolution. 
(3)  Termination without Successor Trustee. If upon involuntary termination, the GMEBS Board by resolution terminates the Employer's Plan outright, the assets of the Employer's Trust Fund will not be transferred to a successor trustee, but will be distributed to Participants and Beneficiaries in accordance with and subject to the termination provisions of Section 18.04(b)-(f), except as otherwise provided in this subsection. The Employer shall provide current Participant information necessary to calculate Accrued Benefits as required under Section 18.04(c), within a reasonable period after the Administrator's request for such information. Any excess assets remaining after satisfaction of Accrued Benefits and payment of the termination fee shall be distributed to the Employer. 
(g)  Freezing of Benefit Accruals. In the event of an Employer's failure to pay required Contributions, the GMEBS Board may by resolution freeze benefit accruals under the Employer's Plan, as an alternative to involuntary termination. If the Board adopts such a resolution, the Employer's Plan must continue to be maintained as a qualified plan and the Employer will be responsible for funding benefits as determined under the frozen Plan's provisions. The Board's resolution to freeze benefit accruals shall specify the extent to which Service and Earnings after the freeze date will or will not be counted for purposes of computing the amount of benefits payable under the Plan, and for purposes of meeting the minimum service requirements for vesting and benefit eligibility under the Plan. The resolution shall also specify the conditions for recommencing benefit accruals under the Plan. The resolution may also provide that, in the event of an Employer's continued failure to pay required Contributions, the Employer's Plan will be terminated outright as of a date certain or upon the Board's adoption of a resolution providing for outright termination, consistent with the provisions of subsection (f)(3). 
(h)  The Board in its discretion may require an Employer to obtain appropriate IRS approval of the qualified status of the terminating Plan or a successor plan. 
(i)  In the event that an Adopting Employer fails to comply with the terms of the Master Plan, Adoption Agreement, or GMEBS Trust Agreement including, but not limited to, failure to pay required Contributions in a timely manner, the Board may in its sole discretion pursue any other legal or equitable means that it deems appropriate, including the filing of a writ of mandamus, to facilitate such compliance. 
Section 18.07. - Termination of the Master Plan by the Board. 
The Board reserves the right to completely terminate the Master Plan and the GMEBS Trust Agreement. In such an event, the provisions of Section 18.04 shall be applied to each Adopting Employer. 
ARTICLE XIX. - NON-ALIENATION OF BENEFITS 
(a)  None of the benefits, payments, proceeds, or distributions payable under the Plan shall be subject to the claim of any creditor of any Participant or to the claim of any creditor of any Beneficiary hereunder, or to any legal process of levy or attachment by any creditor of any such Participant or Beneficiary; and no such benefits shall be in any manner liable for or subject to the debts, liabilities, engagements, or torts of any Participant or Beneficiary; and neither shall any such Participant or Beneficiary have any right to alienate, commute, anticipate, transfer, encumber, pledge, or assign any of the benefits, payments, proceeds, or distributions under this Plan. 
(b)  Nothing in subsection (a) shall be construed to preclude the Administrator, subject to any terms and conditions set by the Administrator, from making a deduction and direct payment to the Adopting Employer or GMEBS on behalf of a Retired Participant for the limited purpose of paying for a contribution or premium for a post retirement benefit offered by the Adopting Employer or GMEBS, if the Retired Participant elects to have such deduction and direct payment made. An election by the Retired Participant for such deduction and direct payment may be revoked at any time. 
(c)  Nothing in subsection (a) shall be construed to preclude the Administrator, subject to any terms and conditions set by the Administrator, from making a deduction and direct payment on behalf of a Retired Participant as provided under Section 845(a)(4)(D) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 in its current form or as amended, and as interpreted by the Internal Revenue Service, for the limited purpose of paying premiums for coverage for an eligible retired public safety officer, his spouse, and dependents, by an accident or health insurance plan or qualified long-term care insurance contract as defined in Section 7702B(b) of Title 26 of the United States Code, if the Retired Participant elects to have such deduction and direct payment made. An election by a Retired Participant for such deduction and direct payment may be revoked at any time. 
ARTICLE XX. - MISCELLANEOUS

(a)  Words used in this Plan in the masculine gender shall be construed to include the feminine gender where appropriate, and words used in this Plan in the singular or plural shall be construed as being in the plural or singular where appropriate. 
(b)  The Plan shall be construed, enforced, and administered and the validity thereof determined in accordance with the Code, and, when not inconsistent with the Code, the laws of the State of Georgia and the bylaws of the Board. 
(c)  In resolving any conflict between provisions of the Plan and in resolving any other uncertainty as to the meaning or intention of any provision of the Plan, the interpretation that (i) causes the Plan to constitute a qualified governmental retirement plan under the provisions of Code Sections 401 and 414(d) and the Trust as exempt from tax under Code Sections 501 and 115, and (ii) causes the Plan to comply with all applicable requirements of the Code and federal law shall prevail over any different interpretation. 
(d)  In resolving any conflict between the Plan and any policy or contract issued under the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall prevail. 
(e)  The headings and subheadings in the Plan are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not to be considered in the construction of any provision of the Plan. 
(f)  Neither the establishment nor maintenance of the Plan nor any amendment thereof, nor any act or omission under the Plan or resulting from the operation of the Plan shall be construed:

(2)  As a contract or Agreement between the Adopting Employer and any Participant or other person; 
(3)  As being consideration for, or an inducement or condition of, employment of any Participant or other person, or as affecting or restricting in any manner or to any extent whatsoever the rights or obligations of the Adopting Employer or any Participant or other person to continue or terminate the employment relationship at any time; or 
(4)  As giving any Participant the right to be retained in the service of the Adopting Employer or to interfere with the right of the Adopting Employer to discharge any Participant or other person at any time. 
Section 20.02. - Non-Diversion. 
(a)  The assets of the Plan shall never inure to the benefit of an Adopting Employer and shall be held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to Participants in the Plan and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the Plan, except in the case of a contribution which is made by an Adopting Employer under a mistake of fact as determined solely by the Administrator. Such contribution shall be returned to the Adopting Employer, upon demand, and shall be reduced for any loss incurred but unadjusted for any gains earned during the time the mistaken contribution was part of the Trust Fund. 
(b)  Trust assets shall be managed in compliance with Code Section 503(b). 
Section 20.03. - Legally Incompetent; Power of Attorney. 
Any Participant, Retired Participant, Terminated Participant, or Beneficiary receiving or claiming benefits under the Plan shall be conclusively presumed to be mentally competent and of age until the Administrator receives a written notice, in a form and manner acceptable to it, that such person is incompetent or a minor, and that a guardian or other person legally vested with the care of his estate has been appointed. In the event a guardian of the estate of any person receiving or claiming benefits under the Plan shall be appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction, payments shall be made to such guardian and the guardian may take any and all actions with respect to the person's interest under the Plan in accordance with the terms of the appointment, provided that proper proof of appointment is furnished in a form and manner suitable to the Administrator. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of liability therefor under the Plan. No person may act as an attorney-in-fact for an Employee, Participant, Terminated Participant, Retired Participant or Beneficiary with respect to a matter involving the Plan unless a valid power of attorney document appointing such person and authorizing such action is submitted in a form and manner acceptable to the Administrator. The Administrator shall be entitled to rely upon a power of attorney document which it reasonably determines to be valid, without liability for actions taken by the Administrator at the request of the designated attorney-in-fact, unless and until the Administrator receives notice that the power of attorney is no longer effective. 
Section 20.04. - Benefits Supported Only by Trust Fund. 
Any person having any claim under the Plan shall look solely to the assets of the Trust Fund for satisfaction.

Section 20.05. - Non-Discrimination. 
The Adopting Employer, through the Pension Committee, shall administer the Plan in a uniform and consistent manner with respect to all Participants. 
Section 20.06. - Limitation of Liability; Legal Actions. 
(a)  It is expressly understood and agreed by each Employee who becomes a Participant hereunder that, except for willful neglect or fraud, neither the Adopting Employer, the Plan Representative, nor the Board of Trustees shall be in any way subject to any suit or litigation, or to any legal liability, for any cause or reason or thing whatsoever, in connection with the Plan or its operation, and each such Participant hereby releases the Adopting Employer, all its employees and agents, the Plan Representative, and the Board of Trustees from any and all liability or obligation. 
(b)  The Adopting Employer and the Plan Representative shall be the only necessary parties to any action or proceeding involving any rights under the Plan or the proper administration thereof, and no Participant, Beneficiary, or other persons having or claiming to have an interest in the Plan shall be entitled to any notice of process. Any final judgment which is not appealed or appealable that may be entered in any such action or proceeding shall be binding and conclusive on the parties hereto and all persons having or claiming to have an interest in the Plan. 
Each fiduciary under the Plan shall be responsible only for the specific duties assigned under the Plan and shall not be directly or indirectly responsible for the duties assigned to another fiduciary. Any person or a group of persons may serve in more than one (1) fiduciary capacity with respect to the Plan. 
Section 20.07. - Claims. 
Any payment to a Participant or Beneficiary, or to their legal representatives, in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, shall to the extent thereof be in full satisfaction of all claims hereunder against the Plan Representative or the Adopting Employer, either of which may require such Participant, Beneficiary, or legal representative, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a receipt and release therefor in such form as shall be determined by the Plan Representative or the Adopting Employer. 
Section 20.08. - Errors in Benefits. 
(a)  Underpayments. Any underpayments from the Trust Fund to a Retired Participant or to a Beneficiary caused by administrative errors shall be corrected with interest compounded annually from the date of the miscalculated payment. The rate applied shall be the actuarially assumed rate utilized by the plan actuary for estimating future plan investment earnings as of the date of the correction. Underpayments shall be made up from the Adopting Employer's Trust Fund. 
(b)  Overpayments. In the event of an overpayment from the Trust Fund to a Retired Participant or to a Beneficiary caused by administrative error, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Corrective Amendment Option. In the event of an overpayment that is due to misapplication of the terms of the plan, the Adopting Employer may be provided the opportunity to amend its Adoption Agreement (a "Corrective Amendment") in order to provide for such overpayment to be permissible under the terms of the plan, but only if the Corrective Amendment is consistent with the circumstances resulting in the overpayment and with the Master Plan, as determined by the Administrator. The Corrective Amendment may be effective either retroactively only, or both retroactively and prospectively. 
(2)  Determination of Reasonableness of Collection from Retired Participants or Beneficiaries. In the event that the Adopting Employer does not adopt a Corrective Amendment, or that the circumstances resulting in the overpayment or the Master Plan would not permit such an amendment, the Administrator and the Adopting Employer will consult in making a determination of whether collection of the overpayment (in full or in part) from a Retired Participant or Beneficiary is reasonable under the particular facts and circumstances involved. In their determination, the Administrator and the Adopting Employer shall consider (1) the hardship of collection on the Retired Participant or Beneficiary; (2) any legal impediments to collection; and (3) the potential risk of litigation if collection is pursued, in consultation with the affected Adopting Employer's counsel. 
(3)  Failure to Reach Agreement on Reasonableness of Collection. If the Administrator and the Adopting Employer cannot reach agreement within six (6) months as to whether collection of an overpayment from a Retired Participant or Beneficiary is reasonable, the Board shall make this determination, considering the factors outlined above in paragraph (2). 
(4)  Collection Process. If a determination under this subsection is made that collection from the Retired Participant or Beneficiary is reasonable, the overpayment shall be corrected with interest compounded annually from the date of the miscalculated payment. The rate applied shall be the actuarially assumed rate utilized by the plan actuary for estimating future plan investment earnings as of the date of the correction. In collecting amounts of the overpayment (in full or in part), the Administrator shall have the discretion to use any of the following options: (i) single sum payments; (ii) installment payments; (iii) actuarial reduction of future Retirement payments; or (iv) deductions from Retirement payments. Retirement payment deductions shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the amount of payment from which the deduction is made. 
(5)  Corrective Payment by Adopting Employer.

Section 20.10. - Right of Recovery. 
If the Administrator makes any payment that according to the terms of the Plan and the benefits provided hereunder should not have been made, the Administrator may recover that incorrect payment, whether or not it was made due to the error of the Administrator, from the person to whom it was made, or from any other appropriate party. If any such incorrect payment is made directly to a Participant, the provisions of Section 20.08 apply. 
Section 20.11. - Evidence of Action. 
Any action by any Adopting Employer pursuant to any of the provisions of the Plan shall be evidenced by ordinance or resolution of its governing body, and the Administrator and the Board shall be fully protected in acting in accordance with such resolution or ordinance so certified to it.

A Participant may only count an aggregate of 8 years of service with other GMEBS employers and other municipalities in Georgia (i.e., 5 years maximum portability service and 3 years maximum service with any other municipality in Georgia) toward this 30-year service requirement.

In the event of a conflict between the provisions of any of the foregoing, they shall govern in the following order: 
(1)  The Act creating the Board of Trustees of The Georgia Municipal Employees' Benefit System, O.C.G.A. Section 47-5-1 et seq. (a copy of which is included in the Appendix to the Master Defined Benefit Plan Document) and any other applicable provisions of O.C.G.A. Title 47; 
(2)  The Master Defined Benefit Plan Document and Trust Agreement; 
(3)  This Ordinance and Adoption Agreement (and any Addendum); and 
(4)  The rules and regulations of the Board. 
In the event that any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this Plan shall be declared or adjudged invalid or unconstitutional, such adjudication shall in no manner affect the previously existing provisions or the other section or sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases of this Plan, which shall remain in full force and effect, as if the section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase so declared or adjudicated invalid or unconstitutional were not originally a part hereof. The Governing Authority hereby declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this Plan or retained the previously existing provisions if it had known that such part or parts hereof would be declared or adjudicated invalid or unconstitutional. 
This Adoption Agreement (and any Addendum) may only be used in conjunction with Georgia Municipal Employees Benefit System Master Defined Benefit Retirement Plan Document approved by the Internal Revenue Service under advisory letter J501718a dated March 30, 2018. The Adopting Employer understands that failure to properly complete this Adoption Agreement (or any Addendum), or to operate and maintain the Plan and Trust in accordance with the terms of the completed Adoption Agreement (and any Addendum), Master Plan Document and Trust, may result in disqualification of the Adopting Employer's Plan under the Internal Revenue Code. Inquiries regarding the adoption of the Plan, the meaning of Plan provisions, or the effect of the IRS advisory letter should be directed to the Administrator. The Administrator is Georgia Municipal Employees Benefit System, with its primary business offices located at: 201 Pryor Street, SW, Atlanta, Georgia, 30303. The business telephone number is: (404) 688-0472. The primary person to contact is: GMEBS Legal Counsel. 
Authorization for Amendments. Effective on and after February 17, 2005, the Adopting Employer hereby authorizes the volume submitter practitioner who sponsors the Plan on behalf of GMEBS to prepare amendments to the Plan, for approval by the Board, on its behalf as provided under Revenue Procedure 2005-16, as superseded by Revenue Procedure 2015-36, Revenue Procedure 2011-49, and Announcement 2005-37. Effective January 1, 2013, Georgia Municipal Association, Inc., serves as the volume submitter practitioner for the Plan. Employer notice and signature requirements were met for the Adopting Employer before the effective date of February 17, 2005. The Adopting Employer understands that the implementing amendment reads as follows: 
On and after February 17, 2005, the Board delegates to the Practitioner the authority to advise and prepare amendments to the Plan, for approval by the Board, on behalf of all Adopting Employers, including those Adopting Employers who have adopted the Plan prior to the January 1, 2013, restatement of the Plan, for changes in the Code, the regulations thereunder, revenue rulings, other statements published by Internal Revenue Service, including model, sample, or other required good faith amendments (but only if their adoption will not cause such Plan to be individually designed), and for corrections of prior approved plans. These amendments shall be applied to all Adopting Employers. Employer notice and signature requirements have been met for all Adopting Employers before the effective date of February 17, 2005. In any event, any amendment prepared by the Practitioner and approved by the Board will be provided by the Administrator to Adopting Employers. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, no amendment to the Plan shall be prepared on behalf of any Adopting Employer as of either: 
•  the date the Internal Revenue Service requires the Adopting Employer to file Form 5300 as an individually designed plan as a result of an amendment by the Adopting Employer to incorporate a type of Plan not allowable in a volume submitter plan as described in Revenue Procedure 2015-36; or 
•  as of the date the Plan is otherwise considered an individually designed plan due to the nature and extent of the amendments. 
If the Adopting Employer is required to obtain a determination letter for any reason in order to maintain reliance on the advisory letter, the Practitioner's authority to amend the Plan on behalf of the Adopting Employer is conditioned on the Plan receiving a favorable determination letter. 
The Adopting Employer further understands that, if it does not give its authorization hereunder or, in the alternative, adopt another pre-approved plan, its Plan will become an individually designed plan and will not be able to rely on the volume submitter advisory letter.

Except as otherwise specifically required by law or by the terms of the Master Plan or Adoption Agreement (or any Addendum), the rights and obligations under the Plan with respect to persons whose employment with the City was terminated or who vacated his office with the City for any reason whatsoever prior to the effective date of this Ordinance are fixed and shall be governed by such Plan, if any, as it existed and was in effect at the time of such termination.

(b)  Transfer of Employees and Assets to Troup County . 
(i)  Employees Transferred to Troup County as of July 1, 2001 - In accordance with the amendment to the Retirement Plan which became effective on June 30, 2001, Eligible Employees of the City of LaGrange, who as of July 1, 2001 are no longer employed by the City of LaGrange due to their transfer of employment to Troup County pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement dated May 19, 2000, between Troup County and the Cities of LaGrange, Hogansville, and West Point, shall be entitled to a Vested Retirement Benefit under the LaGrange Retirement Plan, regardless of their length of Service with the City of LaGrange. The amount of said Vested Retirement Benefit shall be computed in accordance with the terms of the Retirement Plan in effect on June 30, 2001, based upon said Eligible Employees' Final Average Earnings and Total Credited Service with the City as of June 30, 2001. 
(ii)  Transfer of Assets on Behalf of Certain Employees Transferred to Troup County as of July 1, 2001 - Provided the conditions of this subsection 2(b)(ii) are satisfied, the Georgia Municipal Employees Benefit System (GMEBS) is hereby authorized and directed to transfer from the Trust Fund of the City of LaGrange Retirement Plan (this Plan) to the Trust Fund for the Association County Commissioners of Georgia Defined Benefit Plan for Troup County Employees ("Troup County Plan") a lump sum amount equal to the present value of the vested Accrued Benefit under this Plan, as determined by the GMEBS actuary, for each of the following former Employees of the City of LaGrange who became Troup County employees effective July 1, 2001 pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement dated May 19, 2000, between Troup County and the Cities of LaGrange, Hogansville, and West Point: 
Allen Cadwell  Greg Hall  Donnie Howell  Lynn Howard  Nanette Scott  Keith Williams  Elaine Hiatt 
The transfer of assets referred to herein is contingent upon the following: 1) GMEBS' receipt of a properly executed amendment to the Troup County Plan, providing that (a) former City of LaGrange employees on whose behalf assets are to be transferred will receive under the Troup County Plan an amount of credited service for benefit accrual purposes that is equal to the amount of credited service necessary to provide an accrued benefit under the Troup County Plan that is no less than the former employee's Accrued Benefit (as determined by the GMEBS actuary) under this Plan; and 2) said credited service will be taken into account (in addition to any credited service the former employee accrues while employed by Troup County) in determining the amount of any retirement, death, or disability benefit payable to or on behalf of the former employee under the terms of the Troup County Plan; and 3) said former employees' actual service (not Credited Service awarded for benefit accrual purposes as described above) as an employee of the City of LaGrange prior to July 1, 2001, will be treated as "Vesting Service" under the Troup County Plan for purposes of computing eligibility for any and all retirement, death, and/or disability benefits payable under the Troup County Plan. As a further precondition for the transfer of assets, said former employees must submit a request for said transfer, on an applicable form approved by GMEBS and the City, authorizing and directing said transfer of assets on his or her behalf. If the former employee terminates employment from Troup County and if GMEBS receives written notice of same before the transfer of assets is completed, then the former employee's asset transfer request, if any, will be considered null and void and the transfer of assets will not occur. The transfer of assets will not occur unless GMEBS receives a properly completed asset transfer request form before December 31, 2009. The former employee is responsible to ensure that GMEBS receives his or her properly completed asset transfer request form before December 31, 2009. The former employee cannot revoke his/her request once it has been submitted to GMEBS. If GMEBS does not receive the former employee's properly completed asset transfer request form before December 31, 2009, then no transfer of assets will occur on behalf of the former employee. Upon completion of the transfer of assets, said former employees and their heirs and assigns will have no further right, title or interest under the City of LaGrange Retirement Plan (this Plan), and their entitlement to retirement, death, and survivor benefits, if any, with respect to their service with the City of LaGrange prior to July 1, 2001 will be determined in accordance with and subject to the terms of the Troup County Plan, in its current form or as amended. No assets will be transferred on behalf of any former employee who has received a distribution from this Plan prior to the date such transfer would otherwise occur.

In the event that the Participant's Post-Retirement Beneficiary predeceases the Participant, or in the event that there is otherwise no surviving, designated Post-Retirement Beneficiary to whom the benefit under this paragraph 15(a)(ii) is payable, then said benefit shall be paid to the Participant's estate. 
(C)  Amount of Lump Sum Death Benefit . The amount of the lump sum death benefit payable under this paragraph 15(a)(ii) shall be $5,000, which shall be payable without interest upon GMEBS' receipt of documentation (including but not limited to a death certificate for the Participant) sufficient to establish the recipient's entitlement to said amount. 
(b)  Mandatory Participation - Effective April 1, 2002, participation in this Plan shall be mandatory for all Eligible Regular Employees. Any current Eligible Regular Employees who had previously elected not to participate in the Plan are required to participate on and after April 1, 2002. Said Eligible Regular Employees' Total Credited Service shall include Service rendered for the City prior to such date. Provided, however, that said Total Credited Service shall not include any period of time during which the Employer made contributions or facilitated additional deferrals on the Employee's behalf to any other retirement plan or deferred compensation plan.
