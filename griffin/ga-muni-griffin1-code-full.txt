PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Griffin, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1968 Code, as supplemented through December 9, 1997, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1968 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of H. Palmer Carr, Code Attorney, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Andrew J. Whalen, III, City Attorney for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

ARTICLE II. - COMMISSION AND COMMISSIONERS 

Section 2.1. - Corporate and governing authority. 
The municipal government of the city shall consist of a commission of seven citizens, who shall be known as the "Board of Commissioners of the City of Griffin, Georgia," hereafter

The members of the commission shall devote as much of their time to the office as may be necessary.

Section 2.2. - Qualification and election of commissioners. 
(a)  Any person who is a citizen of this state, has attained the age of 18 years, and has at least 12 months' residency within the city shall be eligible to hold the office of commissioner; provided, however, that no person who is not a qualified elector of the city, who has been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude (unless that person's civil rights have been restored), who holds a public office, or who is the holder of public funds unaccounted for shall be eligible to hold the office of commissioner. 
(b)  Candidates for Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 shall have resided within their respective election district for at least six months on the date of qualifying.

(2004 Ga. Laws, page 4232)

Thereafter, the commission, following publication of each United States decennial census, has reapportioned election districts in accordance with Code Section 36-35-4.1 of the O.C.G.A.

I do further swear that I am not the holder of any office of trust under the government of the United States, any other state, or any foreign state which by the laws of the State of Georgia I am prohibited from holding. I do further swear that I am qualified to hold the office of commissioner of the City of Griffin according to the Constitution and laws of Georgia. I do further swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Georgia. I do further swear that I am a resident of the district from which I have been elected and have been a resident of the district for the time required by the Constitution and laws of this state.

(2004 Ga. Laws, page 4232) 
Section 2.7. - Quorum for commissioners meeting; voting; conflicts of interest. 
(a)  Four commissioners shall constitute a quorum. In order to enact ordinances or take action, the vote of a majority of those present shall control. An abstention, except when based upon the member's disqualification for announced conflict of interest or other legal grounds, shall be counted as an affirmative vote. Except when a role call vote is requested by any member, votes may be cast by voice ("aye" or "nay") or by show of hands. The chairperson shall announce all votes and declare each matter approved or rejected. 
(b)  No commissioner shall vote or act upon, or seek to influence the approval or rejection of, any ordinance, resolution, contract or other matter within the official jurisdiction of the city in which that person is financially interested. Any commissioner having a financial interest, directly or indirectly, in any ordinance, resolution, contract, or matter pending before or within a department of the city shall disclose such interest, in writing, to the commission at the earliest opportunity and disqualify himself or herself from participating in any decision or vote relating thereto. 
(2004 Ga. Laws, page 4232) 
Section 2.8. - Meetings of the commission. 
(a)  The commission shall hold regular meetings on the second and fourth Tuesday of each month at such times as set by ordinance, which meetings shall be open to the public, except as allowed by law shall keep minutes of their proceedings; and shall record all their actions therein. They may meet at such times and as often in extra called meetings as any three of them or the chairperson may designate or call. 
(b)  To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property, or public peace, the board of commissioners may convene on call of the chairperson or any two commissioners, provided that such emergency meeting is called in accordance with the Georgia open meetings law, Code Section 50-14-1, et seq., of the O.C.G.A. At such emergency meeting, the board of commissioners may consider and adopt an emergency ordinance, but such ordinance may not levy taxes; grant, renew, or extend a franchise; regulate the rates charged by the city for any utility services provided; or authorize the borrowing of money, except temporary borrowings made in anticipation of taxes. An emergency ordinance shall be proposed in the form required for ordinances generally and shall contain a declaration stating in clear and precise terms the conditions that constitute the emergency warranting the meeting and action taken therein.

The lease or management contract may provide for options to renew such lease or management contract for not more than three renewal periods and each such renewal period shall not be greater than the original length of such lease or management contract.

When the lessee or contractee charges any person to enter or go upon the land for the purpose of attending the annual regional fair or for attending or participating in recreational purposes, the consideration received by the City of Griffin for the lease or management contract shall not be deemed a charge within the meaning of Article 2 of Chapter 3 of Title 51 of the O.C.G.A. 
(b)  The City of Griffin shall have the right unilaterally to terminate such lease after giving three months' notice of its intention to do so. 
(c)  Any lease entered into as provided in subsection (a) of this section shall be automatically terminated upon conviction of the lessee or contractee for any offense involving the conduct of unlawful activity.

(Ord. No. 10-02, § 1, 4-27-2010) 
Sec. 2-188. - Scope of coverage. 
(a)  All purchasing, leasing or contracting for equipment, materials and supplies shall be governed by this division. Contracts for services, where feasible, should be competitively bid upon written specifications approved by the city manager; provided, however, it is recognized that the ability to render certain services, particularly those of learned professionals, are often unique to an individual contractor and are incapable of competitive bidding. All contracts shall be reviewed and approved by the city attorney as to legal form, approved by the board of commissioners and spread upon the minutes of the board of commissioners' meeting at which approval was granted. All contracts shall be executed in the manner and with the requisite formalities set forth in the City Charter or other applicable law; provided, however, when the form of a standardized contract for city-provided utilities or other services has been approved by the board of commissioners, such contract may be executed by the city manager or his designee(s) as and for the act of the commission. 
(b)  Repairs and general maintenance, where feasible, should be competitively bid; however, certain equipment, systems and facilities can only be repaired or serviced through authorized service centers or by specially trained personnel who do not engage in bidding. The public interest is best served by maintaining such equipment, systems and facilities in accordance with manufacturer's requirements and warranties. For this reason, such services may be obtained without first obtaining bids as generally required by this division. 
(c)  Pursuant to O.C.G.A. 13-10-91, all contracts for the physical performance of services within this state, to be binding on and enforceable against the city, shall require the contractor to register and participate in the federal work authorization program to verify work eligibility of all newly hired employees and subcontractors. Before a bid for any such service is considered by the city, the bid shall include a signed, notarized affidavit from the contractor attesting to the following: 
(1)  The affiant has registered with and is authorized to use the federal work authorization program; 
(2)  The user identification number and date of authorization for the affiant; and 
(3)  The affiant is using and will continue to use the federal work authorization program throughout the contract period. 
No contractor or subcontractor under contract with the city in connection with the physical performance of services within this state shall be entitled to payment from public funds for its services unless such contractor or subcontractor registers and participates in the federal work authorization program. It shall be deemed a breach of contract for any contractor, or subcontractor thereof, who physically performs services within this state under a contract with the city, to fail or refuse to participate in the federal work authorization program throughout the term of such contract. It shall be the duty of the contractor and/or subcontractor(s) to maintain records of federal work authorization verification for all newly hired employees for the term of the contract and to maintain such records for not less than three years from the contract's date of final completion. Such records shall be considered an open public record and made available to the city upon request or in the event of contract audit by a federal or state agency; provided, however, any information in such record protected from public disclosure by federal or state law shall be redacted.

Where feasible, whenever like purchases are required by more than one department, the purchasing coordinator shall consolidate purchase orders to receive full advantage of available quantity discounts. 
(b)  All other procurement of equipment, materials, or supplies having an estimated cost of less than $15,000.00 shall be competitively bid upon written specifications drawn by the department manager in consultation with the purchasing coordinator, as approved by the city manager. The manner of advertisement or bid solicitation (including the pre-qualification of potential vendors), the period bid solicitations remain open, and procedures governing bidding and bid openings shall be recommended by the purchasing coordinator and approved, in writing, by the city manager. ALL REQUESTS FOR PROCUREMENT SHALL BE ISSUED WITH RESERVATION OF THE CITY'S RIGHT TO REJECT ALL BIDS; TO REBID UPON READVERTISEMENT (WITH OR WITHOUT MODIFIED SPECIFICATIONS); OR, IN CASES WHERE ALL BIDS RECEIVED FAIL TO MEET SPECIFICATIONS, TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE BIDDER WHOSE PRODUCT COMES CLOSEST TO MEETING SPECIFICATIONS. Purchases of less than $15,000.00 shall be approved, in writing, by the city manager.

Throughout this Code, provisions are made for the issuance by the city of various licenses, permits, and approvals. Some are required by federal or state law while others are part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme adopted by this board of commissioners. The commission finds that the number of ever-increasing demands on city staff, resources, and infrastructure is limited, not only by budgetary constraints, but physical limitations and manpower. It is the objective of this commission to utilize its resources wisely, fairly, and in the most efficient manner, while requiring consideration of criteria and standards without discrimination or favor. The intent of this article is to recognize and provide guidance for city staff and this commission as the city's governing authority to ensure that city services, privileges, and benefits are delivered in a non-discriminatory manner. 
Most all forms of licenses, permits, and approvals required by the city involve some form of deployment of city resources. In order to conserve and allocate these resources wisely, the city often must balance competing factors affecting its citizens, property owners, residents and businesses. Licensing and permitting often requires some form of due process, or notice, and can only be approved following a hearing or other means of allowing citizens to be heard. Adequate advance notice to the pertinent city staff is key to timely and relevant decision-making, as well as a full understanding of material facts and the applicant's objectives. Normally, the burden is on the applicant to apprise the city staff of material information by filing a complete application. 
Fees charged in relation to permits or licenses are established to recoup the city's cost of permit/license review and administration. In certain cases, the fee will also seek to recoup anticipated costs to the city for the burden placed on infrastructure and services, such as additional security and traffic control. The upfront payment of required fees is part of the submission of a complete application. Waiver or reduction of fees and waiver of a complete written application is discouraged, except as incentives for economic development, and should only be approved by the city manager, upon written recommendation of a department manager. 
Last, while it is the general intent of this commission to make its permitting and licensing procedures as simplified as possible, the need for fully informed decision-making by city staff and this commission mandates the need for consistency and transparency, which are only attainable through a written application process, followed by documented verification and review. In all instances where applications are filed, the city will seek to provide a timely response to the applicant, with all final decisions (approval, denial, or approval upon reasonable conditions) given to the applicant in writing.

Sec. 2-216. - Non-discrimination. 
This provision shall apply to all licensing, permitting, and/or approval requests found in this Code. Though certain Code sections may contain objective criteria or standards relevant to the specific license, permit, or approval sought, this provision shall serve as an overlay and guide the decision-making process. 
(1)  No license, permit, or approval shall be denied nor shall the applicant be given less favorable treatment as to time, place, or manner requirements or conditions on account of the race, color, creed, religion, gender, domestic relationship status, familial status, sexual orientation, national origin, political affiliation, or gender identity of the applicant and/or participants in the business, undertaking, event, or activity to be carried out by the applicant under such license, permit, or approval. 
(2)  No license, permit, or approval shall be denied nor shall the applicant be given less favorable treatment as to time, place, or manner requirements or conditions based upon the message or content of speech of the applicant and/or participants in the business, undertaking, event, or activity to be carried out by the applicant under such license, permit, or approval. 
(3)  Where it is assumed or reasonably believed that issuance of a license, permit, or approval is likely to result in unreasonable hostility by opponents of an applicant and/or its group or entity, or there is a heighten risk to public safety, based upon the content of speech or the message conveyed by the applicant and/or participants in the undertaking, event, or activity to be carried out by the applicant under such license, permit, or approval, reasonable accommodation as to time, place, and manner requirements shall be afforded, including provision of city resources necessary for traffic control, and police and fire protection; provided, however, payment for or reimbursement of the cost of such accommodation may be imposed by the city as a reasonable condition for such approval. 
(4)  All other conditions or modifications of the time, place, and manner requirements for a license, permit, or approval shall be reasonable and imposed based upon compelling reasons relating to public safety, health, or the environment. When approval is based upon the imposition of reasonable conditions, all such conditions shall be clearly set forth in the written notice of decision.

The failure to provide requested data, information and records or to make those persons specified available for interrogation within a reasonable time shall be grounds for denial of an application. 
( Ord. No. 17-12, § 1, 8-22-2017 ) 
Sec. 6-37. - Ownership of premises. 
Unless the applicant under this chapter will own the premises from which the business will be conducted, the application shall also disclose the name of every person owning a beneficial interest in the premises and shall state the amount of rental to be paid, the manner in which the rental is to be determined, and to whom and at what intervals the rent is to be paid. The applicant shall also attach a copy of the proposed lease with the verified statement of the applicant that such lease contains the entire agreement between the parties.

Sec. 6-38. - Limitations on interest in licenses. 
No person shall have, own or enjoy any ownership interest in, share in the profits from, or otherwise participate in the business of any alcoholic beverage license unless a full description of such interest shall have been furnished to the city at the time of making application for the license. It shall be the continuing duty of an alcoholic beverage licensee to report to the city manager, in writing, within ten days, any change in any interest in such licensee's business. Failure to report to such change in interest shall be grounds for suspension or revocation of the license. Under the de minimis concept, a person who owns less than ten percent of the shares of a corporation whose stock is publicly traded shall not, on the fact of stock ownership alone, be deemed to have a beneficial interest in a license held by a corporation.

The city manager, upon advice and consent of the board of commissioners, may exempt officers and employees of the city from the provisions of this section, upon written finding that such officer or employee's involvement, direct or beneficial, in any business licensed by the city to engage in the sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages would pose no conflict of interest or interference with the performance by the officer or employee of his official duties for the city. 
(c)  No officer or employee of the city shall be permitted to engage in employment with any person, firm or corporation licensed by the city to sell or distribute alcoholic beverages. The city manager may, in writing, exempt those officers or employees from the prohibition of this section, upon finding that such employment would pose no conflict of interest or interference with the performance by the officer or employee of his official duties for the city; provided, however, no certified police officer shall be permitted employment by any establishment that deals in alcoholic beverages without first obtaining the written consent of the chief of police.

For the purpose of this subpart, "grocery store" shall mean a grocery retailer carrying a full selection of food and grocery items, including fresh produce and meats and having a minimum total retail floor space of 10,000 square feet of which at least 85 percent is reserved for the sale of food and other nonalcoholic beverage items. A "convenience store" shall mean a retail store carrying a limited selection of canned, packaged or prepared food and grocery items and at which gasoline may be regularly available for sale, provided that no service or mechanical work is performed on motor vehicles, and provided further that the minimum wholesale value of the inventory of food and grocery items maintained on the premises for sale to the public is no less than $10,000.00, exclusive of malt beverages and wine, tobacco products and candy. Discount/general-merchandise department store means a store with retail floor space open to the public in excess of 9,000 square feet of which no more than 4 percent is devoted to the sale of alcoholic beverages. For the purpose of this section a "drugstore" shall mean a retail store at which prescription drugs and medications are dispensed under the control of a licensed pharmacist, and which sells at retail various personal health-related items for which prescriptions are not required. 
(c)  Licenses for the package sale of distilled spirits will be issued only for premises located within a commercial zoning classification under the city's Unified Development Code, and fronting on one of the following streets: 
(1)  North Expressway (Hwy. 19/41) from the north city limit south to its intersection with Taylor Street.

(5)  Williamson Road (S.R. 362) from the Martin Luther King, Jr. Bypass (S.R. 341/19 and 41) to the southwest city limits. 
No new license for the retail package sale of distilled spirits shall be approved for a location within 500 yards of any other business licensed to sell packaged distilled spirits at retail, as measured by the most direct route of travel on the ground; provided, however, that this limitation shall not apply to any hotel licensed under this chapter. 
(d)  A specialty package retailer, as defined by this chapter, may hold an ancillary tasting license under this chapter, but may not operate its business in conjunction with any other retail business except as allowed by this chapter. No package sales of any distilled spirit shall be permitted by a specialty package retailer, whose business premises shall be located within a special entertainment district as defined by this chapter. 
(e)  All premises at which the package sale of alcoholic beverages is authorized shall meet all requirements of state law and the city's Unified Development Code, as well as minimum building, fire and life safety codes. 
(f)  Premises licensed on May 15, 2001, for the package sale of distilled spirits and lying outside the locations authorized for package sales in subsection (c) may continue such operation, provided they are in compliance with all other provisions of this chapter. Cessation of any such business for 90 days creates a rebuttable presumption of abandonment and may result in loss of grandfather status and serve as grounds for revoking any current license. Except as provided herein, no new licenses for the package sale of distilled spirits shall be issued for a location not meeting the location requirements of subsection (c). 
( Ord. No. 17-12, § 1, 8-22-2017 )

The city manager shall review the chief's report and make such further investigation as he deems appropriate. All applications shall be investigated and acted upon within 90 days of the date of submission of a completed application, unless consent of the applicant to extend the investigative period has been obtained in writing. Inability of the city manager to obtain the good faith cooperation of the applicant in the investigation process, within the time period specified, shall constitute grounds for denial of the license. 
( Ord. No. 17-12, § 1, 8-22-2017 ) 
Sec. 6-46. - Consideration for granting of licenses. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of the city manager to issue or refuse to issue a license under this chapter to any applicant.

(3)  The reasonably anticipated effect on the immediately surrounding neighborhood for which the license is sought as to traffic congestion, noise and/or light pollution; 
(4)  Whether the applicant and/or any holder of an interest in the license has ever had any alcoholic beverage or business license suspended or revoked by any state or any political subdivision thereof, or whether any alcoholic beverage business with which the applicant and/or any holder of an interest in the license has been associated has been cited for a violation of the laws or regulations of any state or any local ordinance pertaining to alcoholic beverages, and the outcome of such proceedings. 
(b)  If, upon investigation of an application for a license or renewal of an existing license, the city manager determines the applicant or any of its employees have been convicted, or entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendre, to any felony, any law, regulation or ordinance involving alcoholic beverages, gambling, narcotics, or tax laws, sufficient to warrant denial, the city manager shall have the option of issuing a probationary license conditioned upon posting a bond, with adequate security, in an amount not to exceed $5,000.00, in addition to the license or renewal fee. 
( Ord. No. 17-12, § 1, 8-22-2017 ) 
Sec. 6-47. - Grant of application; notice of denial. 
(a)  All applications for alcoholic beverage licenses meeting this chapter shall be granted by the city manager for a period of up to one year, expiring on the last day of December in each year, unless some specific cause regarding location, traffic or environmental conditions or the specific causes set out in section 6-46 justifies a refusal. In the event of denial for location, traffic or environmental conditions, the applicant shall be entitled to file a new application of like kind for a different location without the loss of any part of the application fee. In the event the city requests additional documents during the application review, the 60-day review period shall be stayed until production of the additional documents is completed. 
(b)  If the city manager denies an application for a license, the applicant shall be provided notice in writing of the denial, and a listing of the reasons therefor. The applicant shall have the right to appeal to a hearing officer by filing a request for hearing with the city manager no more than ten days following receipt of the denial notice. A hearing shall be held not more than 30 days from the date the city manager receives the written notice of appeal. Within ten days from the date of conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall notify the applicant and the city manager, in writing of his decision.

Sec. 6-48. - False information in application. 
Any material omission from, or untrue or misleading information in, an original, renewal or transfer application for a license under this chapter shall be cause for the denial or refusal of a license, or for the revocation of a license previously granted. Any failure to notify the city manager of the change in any relationship as specified in section 6-38(d) within ten days after such change is made shall likewise constitute due cause for cancellation, revocation or suspension of a license.

Sec. 6-50. - Annual renewal; payment of fee; suspension of operation. 
All alcoholic beverage licenses are annual licenses that run from January 1 to December 31 of each year. Holders of existing licenses in good standing shall apply to the city manager for renewal for the next calendar year on or before November 1 by filing a renewal application in proper form and tendering the required fees.

The State of Georgia Department of Revenue shall be promptly notified of all licenses which were not timely renewed on or before January 1, and all privilege to carry on and conduct a business governed by this chapter shall be immediately suspended due to license expiration. 
( Ord. No. 17-12, § 1, 8-22-2017 ) 
Sec. 6-51. - Privilege nature of license. 
(a)  All licenses issued under this chapter shall constitute a grant of privilege to carry on or conduct a business covered by such license during the term of the license, subject to the terms and conditions imposed by the City Charter, this chapter and other applicable ordinances of the city and the constitution, laws and regulations of the state and of the United States of America applicable thereto. 
(b)  All licenses issued under this chapter shall have printed on the face the following words: 
THIS LICENSE IS A PRIVILEGE CONDITIONAL ON THE HOLDER MEETING ALL STANDARDS FOR SUCH LICENSE AND OPERATING REGULATIONS APPLICABLE THERETO SET OUT IN CITY ORDINANCES AND GEORGIA LAW. FAILURE TO MEET SUCH STANDARDS OR TO COMPLY WITH SUCH OPERATING REGULATIONS SHALL SUBJECT THE HOLDER TO THE LICENSE BEING REVOKED FOLLOWING NOTICE AND HEARING.

In case of the death of any person owning a license, or any interest therein, the same may, with the approval of the city manager and subject to the terms of this chapter, be transferred to the administrator, executor or personal representative of the deceased person, or to the devisees or heirs at law of the deceased person, if such devisees or heirs meet the qualifications contained in this chapter. The license of a deceased person shall be held by his administrator, executor, or personal representative only for the time necessary to complete administration of his estate and to dispose of the license or interest therein. One transfer may be made by the administrator, executor, or personal representative of a deceased license holder to a person meeting the qualifications of this chapter. 
(c)  Partnerships. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a partner in a partnership holding a license to withdraw from the partnership and to assign his interest to one or more of the partners who were partners at the time of the issuance of the license. Such withdrawal shall not serve to bring any new ownership into the partnership, unless such new owner shall apply for a license and comply with all provisions of this chapter, and then only upon the approval of the city manager. 
(d)  Increased capitalization. A partnership or corporation holding a license may take on additional partners or shareholders, as the case may be, where it is determined that the additional capital furnished is to be used exclusively for additional inventory or expanded facilities of the business or for building new facilities and where it further appears that the other partners or shareholders will not receive any of the additional capital investment. Such additional partner or new stockholder must apply for a license and meet all requirements of a licensee, including approval by the city manager, before he shall be permitted to acquire such interest. 
(e)  Transfer of locations. Should a transfer of location be approved, there shall be no new license fee, but the new premises must meet all location requirements as for a new license. 
( Ord. No. 17-12, § 1, 8-22-2017 ) 
Sec. 6-53. - Suspension and revocation; grounds and procedure. 
(a)  When any state license issued by the commissioner of revenue pursuant to O.C.G.A. Chapter 3, Alcoholic Beverages, is revoked, any similar license issued to the same person by the city shall automatically become invalid and the licensee shall immediately cease and desist to operate thereunder. 
(b)  Except as provided in sections 6-55 and 6-56, no license which has been issued or which may be issued pursuant to this article shall be suspended or revoked except for due cause and after hearing and upon at least three-day prior written notice to the holder of the license of the time, place and purpose of the hearing and a statement of the charges upon which the hearing shall be held. 
(c)  The term "due cause" for the purposes of this section shall include, but not be limited to: 
(1)  Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by, the licensee or any of his employees or any person holding an interest in the license for any felony, any law, administrative regulation or ordinance involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics, or tax laws. 
(2)  Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by, the licensee or any of his employees or any person holding an interest in the license for any sex offense when the licensed business is for on-premises consumption. 
(3)  Conviction of a violation of subsections (e), (f), or (g) of O.C.G.A. § 16-12-35 by an owner, operator, or employee of a alcohol licensee offering to the public any bona fide coin-operated amusement machine within the licensed establishment. 
(4)  Suspension or revocation of any state license required as a condition for the possession, sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages. 
(5)  Material falsification of any fact given in an application for a license issued under this chapter or bearing upon the licensee's qualification therefor. Any act which may be construed as a subterfuge in an effort to circumvent any of the qualifications for a license under this chapter shall be deemed a violation of the requirement attempted to be circumvented. 
(6)  Any person to whom a license has been issued is no longer actively engaged in the dealing of alcoholic beverages (closure of the business for more than 90 consecutive days shall create a rebuttable presumption the licensee has abandoned the business). 
(7)  Failure to meet or maintain any standard prescribed by this chapter as a condition or qualification for holding a license. Loss of qualifications during the term of a license shall be grounds for revocation or for denial of renewal. 
(8)  Any other factor known to or discovered by the city whereby it is objectively shown the licensee, any of the licensee's employees or any person holding an interest in a license, has engaged in conduct at or involving the licensed business or has permitted conduct on the licensed premises that constitutes a violation of federal or state law, local ordinance or administrative regulations involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics for all alcohol licensed businesses and including any sex offense under state law or local ordinances with respect to businesses licensed for on-premises consumption. With respect to this section, it shall be rebuttably presumed that the violative act was done with the knowledge or consent of the licensee; provided, however, that such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such licensee did not know, assist or aid in such occurrence, or in the exercise of full diligence that such licensee could not have discovered or prevented such activity. 
(d)  Notice of suspension or revocation proceedings shall be served on the person(s) named on the license. Notice shall be in writing. The notice may be served personally, by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), or by statutory overnight delivery. If by mail, the notice shall be addressed to the licensee at its last known address as it appears in the records of the city. The burden shall be on the licensee to provide notice, in writing, of any change of address for service of notices and process. In the case of service by registered or certified mail of any notice required by this chapter, the service shall be deemed complete on the third business day following the date of mailing with the United States Postal Service. If by statutory overnight delivery, the notice shall be delivered to the physical street address of the licensee, either at the licensed premises or at his place of residence, and effective on the first business day after depositing with the delivery service. 
(e)  The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer appointed by the chairperson of the board of commissioners. The hearing officer shall be an attorney licensed to practice in the state who is disinterested in the proceeding. 
(f)  Hearings shall be only as formal as necessary to preserve order and shall be compatible with the principles of justice. The city attorney shall present the city's case and bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that due cause exists to suspend or revoke the license. At the hearing the licensee shall have the right to represent itself or be represented by counsel, may cross examine all witnesses offered by the city, and may call witnesses and present evidence in its own behalf. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings under this section, although the hearing officer shall have the right to exclude evidence which has no relevance or carries no indicia of reliability. All testimony shall be offered under oath or affirmation. 
(g)  The hearing officer shall make his final determination within ten business days of the completion of the hearing. The decision shall be placed in writing and contain the hearing officer's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decision as to sanction, if any. Such sanction may include one or more of the following: revocation of the license, suspension of the license for no more than 12 months, imposition of a probationary period not to exceed 12 months, and/or a civil monetary penalty not to exceed $5,000.00. Progressive sanctions, depending on the severity of the violation, are encouraged but not required. Where the remaining term of the license is less than 12 months, imposition of suspension or probation for a period in excess of the term of the existing license shall be applied to any renewal license. A subsequent violation within a probationary period shall be cause for revocation and/or denial of license renewal. A total of three separate and unrelated violations within 24 months, whether or not within a probationary period, shall be grounds for permanent revocation. 
(h)  The hearing officer's decision shall be personally served or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested to the licensee and his attorney, with a copy to the city attorney, within ten business days of the close of the hearing. The decision of the hearing officer shall constitute final action by the city, subject to review upon petition for certiorari to the superior court. 
(i)  Upon receipt of notice of adverse action against the licensee under this section, the licensee may waive its right to a hearing and stipulate to a sanction, as recommended by the city manager, in consultation with the chief of police. Any stipulation entered under this subsection shall be in writing, signed by the licensee, and nonappealable. 
(j)  Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 3-3-2.1, the city manager shall be required to provide notification to the Georgia Department of Revenue within 45 days of any officer, department, agency, or instrumentality of the municipality taking disciplinary action against any person issued a license to operate any premises at which 75 percent or more total gross annual revenue is derived from the sales of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. 
(k)  The notification required under subparagraph (j) above shall be in the format for the reporting of disciplinary actions established by the Georgia Department of Revenue. 
(l)  For purposes of subparagraph (j), "disciplinary action" shall have the same meaning as provided for in O.C.G.A. § 3-3-2.1(a)(1), which includes any citation or arrest arising out of the violation of any law, rule, regulation, resolution, or ordinance of a governmental entity relating to the manufacture, distribution, sale, or possession of alcoholic beverages against a licensee, any employee of a licensee, or any person holding a financial interest in the license of a licensee on the premises or place of business of any licensee.

Sec. 6-55. - Short-term emergency suspension for violation involving licensed business. 
(a)  The city manager has authority to suspend a license for a short-term period not to exceed ten days. The city manager's decision shall be in writing, with the term of the suspension and the reasons stated, and shall be mailed or delivered to the licensee as provided in section 6-53(c). 
(b)  A short-term suspension by the city manager must be for an emergency cause. Emergency cause for the short-term suspension of a license shall consist of a third or subsequent violation by the same licensee or the licensee's agents on the same premises within a two-year period of any state or federal laws, administrative regulations of the state or city ordinances regulating such business holding a license, including those prohibiting gambling, regulating the sale, manufacture, distribution, handling, dealing in, and possession of alcoholic beverages, including the sale or transfer of alcoholic beverages to minors in an unlawful manner, and the manufacture, sale, or distribution of any controlled substance which puts the city and the health and safety of its citizens at such risk that an immediate suspension is necessary until a hearing as provided for in section 6-53 can be held. 
( Ord. No. 17-12, § 1, 8-22-2017 ) 
Sec. 6-56. - Emergency suspension of all alcoholic beverage licenses.

Such suspension may be made effective immediately and shall remain in force until the board of commissioners determines the emergency is over or until the next meeting of the board of commissioners, at which time the suspension shall cease unless the same is extended by affirmative action of the board of commissioners.

(a)  Recomputation of tax; authority to make; basis of recomputation. If the city tax collector is not satisfied with the return of the tax or the amount of the tax required to be paid to the city by any person responsible for collecting and paying the tax over to the city, the tax collector may compute and determine the amount required to be paid upon the basis of any information within his possession or obtained by subpoena served upon the licensee, including itemized receipts. 
(b)  Estimate of gross receipts in absence of return. If any licensee fails to file a return, files a false or fraudulent return, or when the tax collector reasonably believes a tax deficiency is due to a fraudulent intent to evade the tax imposed by this article, the person shall be assessed a specific penalty of 50 percent of the tax due. The city tax collector shall make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts of the licensee or, as the case may be, of the amount of the total sales in the city which are subject to the tax. The estimate shall be made for the period or periods in respect to which the licensee failed to make the return and shall be based upon any information which is or may come into the possession of the tax collector. Upon the basis of this estimate, the tax collector shall compute and determine the amount required to be paid to the city. One or more determinations may be made for one or for more than one period.

(b)  Duty of successors or assignees of operator to withhold tax from purchase money. If any licensee liable for any amount under this article sells his business or quits the business, his successors or assigns shall withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the city tax collector showing that he has been paid, or a certificate stating that no amount is due. 
(c)  Liability for failure to withhold; certificate of notice of amount due; time to enforce successor's liability. If the purchaser of a business fails to withhold the necessary amount from the purchase price as required in this section, the purchaser becomes personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by it to the extent of the purchase price valued in money. Within 30 days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate, the city tax collector shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the purchaser at his address as it appears on the records of the city of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. The time within which the obligation of a successor may be enforced shall begin at the time the licensee sells out his business or at the time that the determination against the licensee becomes final, whichever event occurs later.

Whenever the amount of any tax, penalty or interest has been paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this article, it may be offset as provided in section 6-151(c). If the licensee determines that it has overpaid or paid more than once, which fact has not been determined by the city tax collector, it will have three years from the date of payment to file a claim in writing stating the specific ground upon which claim is founded. The claim shall be audited. If the claim is approved by the city, the excess amount paid the city may be credited on amounts then due and payable from the licensee by whom it was paid or its administrators or executors.

The amount of the determination, exclusive of penalties, shall bear interest at an annual rate equal to the bank prime loan rate as posted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Statistical Release H.15, or any publication that may supercede it, plus three percent, to accrue monthly. Such annual interest rate shall be determined for each calendar year based on the first weekly posting of Statistical Release H.15 on or after January 1 of each calendar year.

(d)  Penalty for fraud or intent to evade. If any part of the deficiency for which a deficiency determination has been made is due to fraud or an intent to evade any provision of this chapter or other authorized rules and regulations, a penalty of 25 percent of the deficiency shall be added thereto in addition to the 15 percent prescribed by subsection (a) of this section.

Sec. 10-31. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this article is to regulate the adverse, secondary effects found to exist in association with adult entertainment/sexually-oriented businesses. Such effects are found to be increased criminal activity (including prostitution and other sex-related crimes, disorderly conduct, alcohol and drug offenses), the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases, and reduced property values and increased urban blight. It is recognized that regulation cannot approach the de facto prohibition of adult entertainment/sexually-oriented businesses, as such have been judicially recognized as a protected form of expression under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. This article represents a balancing of competing interests, after due and careful legislative considerations.

Minor means any person who has not attained the age of 18 years.

Progressive sanctions, depending on the severity of the violation, are encouraged but not required. Where the remaining term of the license is less than 12 months, imposition of suspension or probation for a period in excess of the term of the existing license shall be applied to any renewal license. A subsequent violation within a probationary period shall be cause for revocation and/or denial of license renewal. A total of three separate and unrelated violations within 24 months, whether or not within a probationary period, shall be grounds for permanent revocation. 
(g)  The hearing officer's decision shall be personally served or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested to the licensee and his attorney, with a copy to the city attorney, within ten business days of the close of the hearing.

Such person shall have in their possession while controlling their dog a device or equipment for pick up and removal of the animal excrement and its proper disposal in a sanitary manner.

Sec. 22-51. - Permits. 
(a)  Required. No person, firm or corporation shall erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, convert or demolish any building or structure within the city, or cause the same to be done, without first obtaining a permit for such building or structure from the city. Separate permits are required for grading, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, and low-voltage. 
(b)  Fees. Permit fees shall be established in accordance with a schedule approved by the board of commissioners, as may be revised from time to time. 
(c)  Term.

(d)  Revocation for suspension or abandonment. If work authorized by a permit is suspended or abandoned, after the initial term, for a period of 30 days, without good cause shown to the city manager or his designated representative, the permit may be revoked upon written notification to the permit holder.

(e)  State licensing required. Persons engaging in electrical, plumbing, mechanical, low-voltage or utility contracting on any work within the city are required to possess a license issued by the state construction licensing industry board as a condition for performing the work; provided, however, the owner of a single-family dwelling performing work (other than utility contracting) within a dwelling occupied by him as his personal residence, shall be exempt from state licensing. Where a state license is required, every applicant for a permit shall furnish proof, at time of application, that he or the person contracted to do the work holds a valid state license in good standing. Failure to meet this requirement may be grounds for revocation of the permit. 
(f)  Permits issued for structures with revoked certificates of occupancy. If a certificate of occupancy has been revoked for a structure, the permit issued for that structure is valid for either 90 days or for the amount of time ordered in the relevant order issued by the Griffin Municipal Court, whichever is longer. 
(g)  Indebtedness to city. Unless prior arrangement has been made to satisfy the debt owed, no permit under this chapter shall be issued to any applicant if any person holding a beneficial interest in the property or the business applying for the permit owes any delinquent fines or other assessments to the city.

No permits shall issue on any project where the structure to be built or improved thereon is a "special hazard structure" or the use to be conducted therein is a "special hazard use", without first obtaining the approval of building plans by the state fire marshal's office. Where a project is subject to permitting under the state soil erosion and sedimentation control law, no permit shall issue for any land-disturbance activity unless approved plans are received from the district soil conservation office and all required stabilization facilities are in place, and ready for inspection. All buildings and structures intended for human occupancy shall have a safe source of drinking water and sanitary disposal; no permit shall issue for any building or structure which does not have access to public water and sewer unless plans for a well and/or septic tank have been approved by the county health department.

Such notice shall be given in writing, directed to the owner of the property and to the person doing the work, and shall state the conditions under which work may be resumed. Where an emergency situation exists, the city manager or his designated representative shall not be required to give a written notice prior to stopping the work.

The city manager or his designated representative may also revoke a permit upon determining that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving, or demolition of the building or structure for which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of state minimum standard codes; provided, the work was stopped in accordance with section 22-53 and the permittee has not met the conditions for resuming the work after a reasonable period for compliance has been granted. 
(Ord. No. 01-19, § 1(22-7), 12-11-2001) 
Sec. 22-55. - Inspections; right of entry. 
Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of the state minimum standard codes, or whenever the city manager or his designated representative has probable cause to believe that there exists in any building or structure or upon any premises within the city any condition or code violation which makes such building, structure, or premises, unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the city manager or his designated representative, may enter such building, structure, or premises, at all reasonable times to inspect the same or to perform any duty imposed by this article; provided, if such building, structure, or premises is occupied, he shall first present proper credentials and request entry from the building's owner or occupant. If such building, structure or premises is unoccupied, he shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or person having charge or control of the building, structure or premises and request entry. If entry is refused, the city manager or his designated representative may apply to the judge of the municipal court of the city for an administrative search warrant. 
(Ord. No. 01-19, § 1(22-8), 12-11-2001) 
Sec. 22-56. - Service of orders, rulings, etc.; appeals. 
All decisions, orders and rulings of the city manager or his designated representative shall be in writing and served upon the applicant, permit holder, owner of property affected or his agent, and, if applicable, persons in possession or occupancy of affected premises. Where such decisions cannot be personally served, service shall be made by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the party's last known address as shown on official government records. Any party aggrieved by a decision, order or ruling of the city manager or his designated representative may seek review thereof by filing a written petition for certiorari, within 30 days, with the superior court of the county; provided, however, in any case where the city manager or his designated representative has issued an order for the repair, closing or vacating of a building or structure on grounds it is unsafe, unsanitary or dangerous so as to constitute a public nuisance, no review may be had until the municipal court has entered its final order in the nuisance abatement proceeding. 
(Ord. No. 01-19, § 1(22-9), 12-11-2001) 
Sec. 22-57. - Variances. 
In those limited circumstances where the state minimum construction codes allow a local variance based upon hardship, the board of commissioners may, upon finding that strict enforcement of the state minimum standard codes would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and purpose of such codes and the public interest, grant a variance, subject to finding, in writing, all of the following: 
(1)  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the building, structure, or system involved and which are not applicable to others similarly situated; 
(2)  That the special condition and circumstances do not result from the action or inaction of the applicant; 
(3)  That granting a variance will not confer on the applicant any special privileges that are denied by the codes to other buildings, structures, or service systems; 
(4)  That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the building, structure, or service system; and 
(5)  That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of such codes and will not be detrimental to the public health, safety and general welfare. 
Applications for variance shall be advertised not less than 15 days prior to conducting an evidentiary hearing before the board of commissioners. Such hearing shall be informally conducted, with the applicant having the burden of proof. Each decision of the board of commissioners shall recite the factual findings underlying its decision and the reasons for such decision. In granting a variance, the board of commissioners may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the codes, including a reasonable time limit in which the variance is required to be commenced or completed, or both. A copy of the board of commissioners's written decision shall immediately be filed in its minutes of the hearing at which the variance was considered and a copy promptly served upon all affected parties. Decisions of the board of commissioners shall be final, subject to review by petition for certiorari to the superior court, filed within 30 days of entry of the written decision.

(b)  If the public officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall file a complaint in rem in the municipal court of the city against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties in such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance.

The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing. 
(c)  If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state, in writing, findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
(1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation; and, if applicable, to secure by closing the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or

For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered; and, provided further, that if the unsatisfactory condition is limited solely to the presence of graffiti, the dwelling, building or structure shall not be ordered demolished or closed, but its owner may be ordered to repair the same by cleaning or removal of the graffiti. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, chapter 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction.

Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or any equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action shall commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
(e)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
(f)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
(g)  The lien provided for in subsection (e) shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in Spalding County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection (a). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall, within 90 days of the completion of repairs, demolition or closure, forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. 
(h)  It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. § 48-4-5; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply; provided, further, that redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. The tax commissioner may initiate enforcement of liens imposed under this section at any time following receipt of the final determination of costs from the public officer. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
(i)  The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the municipality whose ordinance is being enforced. The tax commissioner may retain an amount equal to the cost of administering collection of the lien. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
(j)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
(k)  Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

(c)  Orders and other filings made subsequent to service of the initial complaint shall be served in the manner provided in this section on every interested party who answers the complaint or appears at the hearing. Any interested party who fails to answer or appear at the hearing shall be deemed to have waived all further notice in the proceedings.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 30-1. - Purpose and intent of regulation. 
The care accorded the remains of deceased persons reflects respect and regard for human dignity as well as cultural, spiritual, and religious values. The General Assembly of Georgia has declared that human remains and burial objects are not property to be owned by the person or entity which owns the land or water where human remains and burial objects are interred or discovered, but human remains and burial objects are a part of the finite, irreplaceable, and nonrenewable cultural heritage of the people of Georgia which should be protected. It is the intent of this chapter that the regulations contained herein be construed to require respectful treatment of human remains in accord with the equal and innate dignity of every human being and consistent with the identifiable ethnic, cultural, and religious affiliation of the deceased individual as indicated by the method of burial or other historic evidence. 
( Ord. No. 16-07, § 1, 6-14-2016 ) 
Sec. 30-2. - Definitions. 
As used in this chapter, the term: 
Abandoned cemetery means a cemetery or known burial ground which shows signs of neglect including, without limitation, the unchecked growth of vegetation, repeated and unchecked acts of vandalism, or the disintegration of grave markers or boundaries and for which no person or entity can be found who is legally responsible for and financially capable of the upkeep and maintenance of such cemetery or burial ground. 
Burial ground means an area used for interment of human remains, outside of a dedicated cemetery as hereinafter defined. 
Burial object means any item reasonably believed to have been intentionally placed with human remains at the time of interment, or any memorial, tombstone, grave marker, or shrine which may have been added subsequent to interment. Such term shall also include any coping, curbing, enclosure, fencing, pavement, shelter, wall, stonework, pottery, or other grave object erected or deposited incident to or subsequent to interment. 
Cemetery means any land or structure within the city dedicated to and used for interment of human remains. It may be either a burial plot for earth interments, a mausoleum for vault or crypt interments, a columbarium (a structure consisting of multiple spaces or "niches" for the permanent storage of cremated remains or "ashes"), or a combination thereof. Cemeteries shall either be publicly-owned by the federal, state, or a local government, privately-owned by an entity licensed by the state to operate a perpetual care cemetery, or by a church or religious institution who is legally responsible for and financially capable of the upkeep of such cemetery. Private, family-owned cemeteries are no longer permitted in the city. All new cemeteries, other than those owned by the city, shall be permitted in accordance with the Unified Development Code of Griffin, Georgia. 
Human remains means the bodies of deceased human beings in any stage of decomposition, including cremated remains. 
( Ord. No. 16-07, § 1, 6-14-2016 ) 
Sec. 30-3. - Burial in cemetery required; disinterment or disturbance without permit prohibited. 
(a)  No human remains shall be interred at any place within the corporate limits of the city other than in the cemeteries established by the city, a church cemetery, or a perpetual care cemetery licensed by the State of Georgia. 
(b)  No person, including the owner or occupier of land on which a cemetery or burial ground is located, or immediately adjacent thereto, shall knowingly disturb a cemetery, burial ground, human remains, or burial objects, unless a permit is first obtained from the board of commissioners of the city, under the procedure set forth in Chapter 72 of Title 36, O.C.G.A. 
(c)  Any willful or knowing violation of this section shall constitute a misdemeanor of a high and aggravated nature, punishable upon conviction in the Superior Court of Spalding County, by a fine not to exceed $5,000.00, and incarceration not to exceed six months, or both. 
( Ord. No. 16-07, § 1, 6-14-2016 ) 
Sec. 30-4. - Authority to preserve and protect abandoned cemeteries and burial grounds. 
Whenever the board of commissioners of the city finds and determines that a cemetery or burial ground within the city has become abandoned, it shall be within the authority of the city manager or his designee to preserve and protect such abandoned cemetery or burial ground, through the expenditure of public funds, to keep it safe from destruction, peril, or other adversity. Such action may include the placement of fencing, signs, markers, or other appropriate features so as to identify the site as a cemetery or burial ground and may include the periodic cleaning, maintenance, and upkeep of the site so as to aid in its preservation and protection. The city manager is authorized to retain the services of an archeologist, a genealogist, attorney, or accountant, as required, to determine the person or entity legally responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the cemetery or burial ground and whether or not that person or entity is financially capable of doing so. If such person or entity is determined to be legally responsible and financially capable, the city manager shall seek reimbursement from such person or entity, using all legal means at his or her disposal. 
( Ord. No. 16-07, § 1, 6-14-2016 ) 
ARTICLE II. - RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR CITY-OWNED AND MAINTAINED CEMETERIES 

Sec. 30-31. - Applicability. 
The rules and regulations in this article shall apply to all city cemeteries, except where otherwise specified. 
( Ord. No. 16-07, § 1, 6-14-2016 ) 
Sec. 30-32. - Designation of city cemeteries. 
The city owns and maintains the cemeteries known as Oakhill Cemetery, Rest Haven Cemetery, Veterans Memorial Cemetery, and the Historic Confederate Cemetery. The original cemeteries were laid out by the city and burial lots were sold, in fee simple, as evidenced by the delivery of deeds to those lots; many of those deeds were never recorded in the land records, which in many cases has today caused their legal ownership to become unclear or uncertain. 
By ordinance, enacted February 28, 1961, no future lot sales were to be made in the city cemeteries and all burial spaces sold thereafter, including in future portions of the existing cemeteries and any new cemeteries, were to be perpetual care, evidenced by a burial rights contract delivered to the buyer. Provision was made in said ordinance for the owners of existing cemetery lots to convert their lots to perpetual care by redelivering title to the lot to the city and payment of a perpetual care fee. Perpetual care fees from the sale of burial rights, including conversion of existing cemetery deeds, are deposited into the City of Griffin Cemetery Trust Fund. 
While many lot owners took advantage of the opportunity to place their lots under perpetual care, many others did not. At this time, the city provides a consistent level of general maintenance throughout its cemeteries, without distinction as to ownership of the underlying fee. This board of commissioners finds and concludes that individual ownership of lots remains scattered throughout the older, original sections of Oakhill Cemetery and Rest Haven Cemetery, where those persons buried in said lots no longer have descendants now living and therefore, no person or entity is now legally responsible and financially capable of providing for their upkeep and maintenance. Thus, this board concludes that those lots in its cemeteries which were earlier sold to buyers in fee simple, but for which no conversion later occurred under the ordinance of February 28, 1961, are deemed the equivalent of an abandoned cemetery, thus warranting the use of public funds for future upkeep and maintenance. 
( Ord. No. 16-07, § 1, 6-14-2016 ) 
Sec. 30-33. - Rules and regulations; amendments. 
The board of commissioners may, from time to time, adopt, by resolution, such rules and regulations as they shall deem necessary for the use and maintenance of the city's cemeteries. Such regulations may be amended or repealed, as needed. When the board has adopted rules and regulations as established by this section, a copy thereof shall be maintained in the city manager's office and in the cemetery office for public inspection and copying.

If such person has no guardian or personal representative, service shall be perfected upon the probate judge of the county, who shall appoint a guardian ad litem for such person. 
In addition, where the alleged public nuisance involves a condition or activity existing upon private property, the petitioner shall cause notice of the filing of the petition, together with date, time and place of hearing, to be served upon the tax commissioner of the county. Personal service under this article may be made by any law enforcement officer of the city or the county, or any citizen over the age of 18 years specially appointed by the judge of the municipal court, and an affidavit of return of service shall be executed by such person and filed with the clerk of the municipal court prior to the date of hearing. 
(d)  Upon filing of a petition, the clerk of the municipal court shall issue a summons notifying the respondent(s) that a hearing will be held before the court at a date, time and place certain. Such hearing shall be scheduled not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of the petition, with the date thereof to be determined based upon the manner in which the petition must be served. The summons shall notify respondent(s) of the right to file an answer to the petition and to appear, in person or by attorney, and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing. 
(Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 2-12-2002) 
Sec. 42-34. - Trial procedure; appeal. 
(a)  The burden at trial shall be upon the petitioner to prove the existence of a public nuisance by a preponderance of the evidence. A written finding by any governmental officer, environmental enforcement officer, public health officer, fire inspector, life safety inspector, or building inspector, based upon physical inspection, that real property or a structure or condition existing upon real property is a health, safety, or environmental hazard shall constitute prima-facie evidence that such property, structure, or condition constitutes a public nuisance. 
(b)  Proceedings to abate a public nuisance under this article are an action at law and shall not require the intervention of equity. The question of whether or not a public nuisance exists is neither criminal or quasi-criminal in nature and therefore the court shall not impose a fine as a condition of its order to abate the existence or continuance of the nuisance. The order of abatement shall define with particularity the condition or occurrence found to constitute the nuisance and provide specifically for its cessation or removal within a reasonable time period. The municipal court is empowered to enforce its judgments by contempt. 
(c)  Any final judgment entered by the municipal court under this article is subject to review by certiorari in the superior court of the county, upon application filed within 30 days of the service of said order upon the respondent(s). 
(d)  Proceedings under this article cannot be brought for the recovery of money damages; however, upon appropriate findings, the court may order payment of restitution for special injuries proved. Costs of the proceedings shall be imposed upon the respondent(s) in all cases wherein the court finds the respondent responsible for the maintenance of a public nuisance. 
(Ord. No. 02-02, § 1, 2-12-2002)

( Ord. No. 17-17, § 1, 11-28-2017 ) 
Sec. 42-63. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of this article and the state general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article under section 42-64 shall be prepared and approved before the land-disturbing activity takes place. The minimum requirements of section 42-65(c) and the state general permit shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation, and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity until the site is finally stabilized in accordance with requirements of this article and the state general permit. 
(b)  Best management practices required; minimum standards: 
(1)  Best management practices shall be required for all projects involving land-disturbing activities, including those exempt from permitting and/or requiring an approved plan under section 42-64. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or local issuing authority or to any other allegation of noncompliance with this article, paragraph (2) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-5, or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30. As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia." 
(2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and/or maintained shall constitute a separate violation of this article, any land-disturbing permit issued by the local issuing authority, or any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout streams. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, and/or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of this article, any land-disturbing permit issued by the local issuing authority or any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30 for each day on which such failure occurs; provided, however, the fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall not, without corroborating evidence, constitute proof of or create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of a permit issued hereunder. For purposes of this paragraph, maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to its specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
(4)  The director or local issuing authority may require reasonable and prudent monitoring and reporting of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  Neither the approval of any permit under the provisions of this article nor failure of the local issuing authority, division, or director to enforce compliance with the provisions of this article or any permit issued hereunder shall relieve any person from legal liability for damages to others caused by such person's land-disturbing activity, nor create any right of action against or impose any liability upon the local issuing authority, division or director for damages to any persons or property. 
(6)  No provision of this article shall authorize any person to violate Article 2 of Chapter 5 of O.C.G.A. Chapter 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", or to pollute any waters of the State of Georgia as defined herein. 
(c)  Minimum requirements. For the purpose of regulating land-disturbing activities, every person shall be required, at a minimum, to follow protections at least as stringent as the state general permit and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia", as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion. 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum. 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential. 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented. 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum. 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable. 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development. 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control measures shall be installed as soon as practicable. 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of this section. 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills. 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property. 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners. 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum. 
(14)  Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent properties and waters beyond the levels specified in section 42-63(b). 
(d)  Establishment of buffer; exceptions; variance of buffer width; land-disturbing activities within buffers. Buffers on state waters are valuable in protecting and conserving land and water resources; therefore, minimum mandatory buffers should be established and protected. In accordance with O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b)(15), there is hereby established a minimum 25-foot natural, undisturbed buffer along the banks of all state waters within the jurisdiction of the City of Griffin, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action; provided, however, that where it is not readily evident that vegetation has been wrested from the stream bank, the buffer shall be measured horizontally from the stream bank as defined in this article. Excepted from this minimum buffer requirement are state waters meeting those conditions: (i) as provided by paragraphs 16 and 17 of subsection (b) of O.C.G.A. § 23-7-6; (ii) where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment in accordance with Rules and Regulations of the Department § 391-3-7-.05; (iii) where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8; (iv) where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented; (v) along any ephemeral stream, or (vi) where shoreline or streambank stabilization structures are installed to prevent erosion under a plan or pursuant to a permit issued by the city. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, following completion of construction and stabilization of the land-disturbing activity site, a buffer of at least 25 feet shall remain in place, subject to the uses and limitations imposed thereon by law, unless the director issues a variance, pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b)(15)(A)(ii). The city as local issuing authority has no power to waive the requirements of this section or issue any variance therefrom. 
The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
(1)  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within any buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed, except as otherwise provided by this section. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a property owner may apply to the city for a permit to thin or trim vegetation within the buffer as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural tree canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
(2)  Permitted land uses or activities within the buffer are as follows: 
a.  A project involving the construction or repair of an existing infrastructure project or a structure that, by its nature, must be located within the buffer. Such structures include, but are not limited to, dams, public water supply intake structures, detention/retention ponds, wastewater discharges, docks including access ways, boat launches including access ways, and stabilization of areas of public access to water; 
b.  A project that will result in the restoration of or an enhancement to improve water quality and/or aquatic habitat; 
c.  Buffer intrusion necessary to provide reasonable access to a property or properties; 
d.  Buffer intrusion for water and sewer lines that cannot reasonably be placed outside the buffer, under generally accepted engineering practices, provided that stream crossings occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; they cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented; 
e.  Buffer intrusions and stream crossings for other utilities, including but not limited to gas, liquid, power, telephone, telecommunications, and other pipelines, provided that the number of crossings and the amount of vegetative disturbance are minimized and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented; 
f.  Recreational foot trails and viewing areas (non-pervious), provided that impacts to the buffer are minimal; 
g.  Projects where the proposed land-disturbing activity within the buffer has been permitted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer under Sec. 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendment of 1972, 33 U.S.C. § 1344, and the Corps of Engineers has approved a mitigation plan to be implemented as a condition of such permit; or 
h.  Projects and activities for which a plan has been approved by the division that shows that, even with the proposed land-disturbing activity within the buffer, the completed project will result in maintained or improved water quality downstream of the project; 
(3)  Where the use or land-disturbing activity within the buffer has been otherwise permitted or exempted through rules and regulations of the board of the department of natural resources.

Furthermore, the exemptions of this section shall apply only to permitting requirements imposed by this article and shall not exempt a project under other regulations imposed by the city. 
( Ord. No. 17-17, § 1, 11-28-2017 ) 
Sec. 42-65. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  Generally. No land-disturbing activity shall be conducted within the City of Griffin, except those land-disturbing activities exempted from permitting in accordance with section 42-64, without the operator first securing a permit from the local issuing authority and/or providing notice of intent to the division, with a copy submitted to the local issuing authority. Before undertaking any land-disturbing activity, the property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall review the general development plans, ordinances and requirements of the local issuing authority that affect the tract to be developed and the areas surrounding it. They shall review the Unified Development Code, stormwater management regulations and permitting requirements, flood damage prevention regulations, this article, and any other codes and ordinances which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Griffin. 
(b)  Application requirements: 
(1)  The application for a permit shall be made only in the name of the owner and/or operator; provided, however, if the operator is not the owner holding record legal title to the property on which the land-disturbing activity is to occur, the name, mailing address and telephone number of the owner shall be stated in the application. Every operator, who is not the owner, shall provide written designation of his authority. Applications shall be submitted to the director of planning and development, in proper form, and must include five copies of the applicant's proposed erosion, sediment and pollution control plan, with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sediment and pollution control plans shall conform to the provisions of section 42-63(c). All applications shall contain a certification stating the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. Incomplete applications and plans, which on their face fail to conform to this section, shall be promptly returned to the applicant. 
(2)  A local permitting fee, in the amount of $20.00 shall be charged for each acre, or fraction thereof, in the project area, regardless of actual size of land-disturbing activity on the project site; provided, however, for any project of 500 acres or more, the fee shall be $10.00 per acre or fraction thereof. No application shall be deemed complete unless the requisite fees are paid to the local issuing authority at time of filing. This fee shall be retained by the local issuing authority and shall cover the cost of plan review and permit issuance. 
(3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5)(a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development of each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land-disturbance permit. One-half of the fees levied under this subsection shall be remitted by the primary permittee directly to the division; the other half shall be submitted to the local issuing authority to cover the costs of inspections and enforcement. 
(4)  Upon receipt of a complete application and plan in proper form, and payment of all required fees, the director of stormwater management shall immediately refer the application and plans to the district for its review and approval, or disapproval, concerning the adequacy of the erosion and sedimentation control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be promptly forwarded, in writing, to the local issuing authority. No permit shall be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 42-63(c), if required, and bonding have been obtained. District review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into a written agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. A local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the plan submittal. 
(5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits (either in this or any other jurisdiction), of this Article, or the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Control Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application, or condition its approval on the posting of a performance bond. 
(6)  The local issuing authority shall require the permit applicant to post a performance bond, in the form of a surety bond issued by a company licensed in the State of Georgia and returnable to the City of Griffin, government security, cash, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, as a condition for issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond, or any part thereof, to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
(7)  Where the local issuing authority intends to revoke or suspend a permit and call the bond (or a portion thereof) to be forfeited, notice of such action shall be given in writing to the permit holder. The aggrieved party is entitled to request, in writing, within five business days of receipt of notice, a hearing before the city manager, or his designated hearing officer. Such hearing shall be informally conducted, but held in such manner as to afford the applicant fundamental due process. A hearing record shall be prepared by the city. Any person aggrieved by a final determination of the city manager or his designee shall be entitled to file a petition for writ of certiorari to the Superior Court of Spalding County, Georgia, within 30 days of written notice of such final action. 
(c)  Plan requirements: 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in section 42-63(c) of this article and the state general permit. Conformance with the minimum requirements may be attained through the use of design criteria in the current issue of the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, published by the State Soil and Water Conservation Commission as a guide; or through the use of alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article, and may be referenced over the Internet at "www.gaswcc.org". The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. 
(2)  Data required for the site plan shall include all information requested on the appropriate Erosion, Sediment and Pollution Control Plan Review Checklist, established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
(d)  Permits: 
(1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application and payment of all applicable fees, provided bonding and variances, where necessary, are obtained. Failure to act within 45 days of receipt of a completed application shall be considered an approval of the permit. The permit shall expressly state all conditions or restrictions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sediment and pollution control plan has been approved by the district or the local issuing authority, and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by section 42-63(c) are obtained, bonding requirements are met and all codes, ordinances and other applicable rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority have been satisfied. If the permit is denied, the reason(s) for denial shall be stated, in writing, setting forth specifically wherein the application or plan is deficient, and served by regular U.S. mail upon the applicant, with notice of the right to appeal. 
(3)  If the project is to be developed in phases, a phased development schedule may be agreed to, in writing, with the director of stormwater management. In most cases the entire project site shall be required to permit and install erosion and sediment control measures for the entire site prior to any land-disturbing activities. Where phasing is permitted, a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(4)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in title is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sediment and pollution control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any purchaser of any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit, and all current and future maintenance obligations imposed thereon, whether under this article or related ordinances. 
(5)  A permit issued under this article shall not be valid for work commencing more than six months after its issuance date. Where work is not timely commenced, or work on the project is suspended for more than three months after commencement, the local issuing authority shall automatically suspend the permit, until the applicant provides an affidavit from a registered or certified professional in engineering, architecture, landscape architecture, land surveying, or erosion and sedimentation control, certifying that, based upon diligent investigation, including an on-site inspection, no material changes have occurred since the erosion and sediment control plan was originally approved. 
(6)  Any change or amendment of design and construction plans for the project which may materially impact or negate the permit based on original approval of an erosion, sediment, and pollution control plan shall require a permit amendment. All amendments shall be applied for in writing and follow the same procedure as original applications for a permit. 
(7)  Any land-disturbing activities by the City of Griffin shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other laws and ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the city. Erosion, sediment and pollution control plans for the local issuing authority shall be submitted to the district for review and approval or disapproval. 
( Ord. No. 17-17, § 1, 11-28-2017 ) 
Sec. 42-66. - Inspections and citations. 
(a)  Inspections. Inspections and compliance monitoring, pursuant to this article, shall be conducted by the stormwater management department, and their designated inspectors. The inspector shall periodically inspect the site of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in a land-disturbing activity as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article or O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1, et seq., a written notice to comply shall be served immediately upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. Except as provided in section 42-67, the inspector may require that all land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action and mitigation have been taken. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
(b)  Inspection authority. The local issuing authority shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out its duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
(c)  Right of entry for inspection. No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division, who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
( Ord. No. 17-17, § 1, 11-28-2017 ) 
Sec. 42-67. - Penalties and enforcement. 
(a)  Mandatory stop-work orders; injunctive relief. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining a required permit, fails to maintain a required buffer of state waters, or significant amounts of sediment (as determined through inspection by the local issuing authority, the commission, the district or the division) have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed and maintained, a stop-work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority. Such stop-work order shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall remain in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop-work order shall apply to all work being performed or undertaken on the site, including non-land-disturbing activities, with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls necessary to bring the project into compliance. If the person to whom such order is directed fails to comply, the person shall be subject to injunction of the project, work or activity from the superior court of the county where such person resides, or in the case of a non-resident of this state, from the Superior Court of Spalding County; provided, however, where exigent circumstances exist, the local issuing authority may apply to the Superior Court of Spalding County for a temporary restraining order without the necessity of showing an adequate remedy at law exists. 
(b)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply setting forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and stating the time within which such measures must be completed has been given, and the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, posted under the provisions of section 42-65. The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance with the plan and this article. 
(c)  Monetary penalties. In addition, and cumulative of the above, any person who violates the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Control Law, O.C.G.A. Title 12, Chapter 7, or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, any provision of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any stop-work order of the local issuing authority shall be subject to appear, upon citation, before the Municipal Court of the City of Griffin. Each day during which the violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall constitute a separate violation. The general limitations of law on the jurisdiction of municipal courts notwithstanding, any person found liable in the municipal court for violating any provision of law or this article, or who violates any permit condition or limitation, or negligently or intentionally fails or refuse to comply with any stop-work order issued by the local issuing authority, shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day for each violation, together with forfeiture or revocation of any regulatory license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority's jurisdiction.

Sec. 42-68. - Education and certification. 
(a)  Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspection or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent upon their level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(b)  For each site on which land-disturbing activity occurs, each entity or person acting as either a primary, secondary, or tertiary permittee, as defined in the state general permit, shall have a minimum of one person who is in responsible charge of erosion and sedimentation control activities on behalf of said entity or person and meets the applicable education or training certification requirements developed by the commission present on site whenever land-disturbing activities are conducted on that site. A project site shall herein be defined as any land-disturbance site or multiple sites within a larger common plan of development or sale permitted by an owner or operator for compliance with the state general permit. 
(c)  Persons or entities involved in projects not requiring a state general permit but otherwise requiring certified personnel on site may contract with certified persons to meet the requirements of this article. 
(d)  If a state general permittee who has operational control of land-disturbing activities for a site has met the certification requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19, then any person or entity involved in land-disturbing activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet the educational requirements specified in paragraph (4) of subsection (b) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19 and shall not be required to meet any educational requirements that exceed those specified in said paragraph. 
( Ord. No. 17-17, § 1, 11-28-2017 ) 
Sec. 42-69. - Administrative appeal and judicial review. 
(a)  Administrative remedies. The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with conditions of a permit by the local issuing authority upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sediment and pollution control plan, or that the holder is no violation of permit conditions, or that the holder is in violation of any related environmental ordinance or development requirement, shall entitle the person holding the permit to a hearing before the city manager, within five business days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a written notice requesting to be heard. The decision of the city manager shall be final. 
(b)  Judicial review. Any person aggrieved by a final decision or order of the local issuing authority, after exhaustion of his administrative remedies, shall have the right to petition the Superior Court of Spalding County, Georgia, for a writ of certiorari.

ARTICLE V. - NOISE CONTROL 

Sec. 42-100. - Purpose and intent; definition; sound measurement standard. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. This article is enacted to protect, preserve and promote the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Griffin, Georgia, through the control of noise, a recognized form of environmental pollution. It is the intent of this article to establish objective standards that will reduce excessive community noises, which are harmful and otherwise detrimental to individuals and to the community in the enjoyment of life and property and in the conduct of business. It is not the intent of this article to regulate noise based upon its source, but based upon objective volume limitations at objective distances from the source, which for purposes of this article intentionally vary based upon the time of day and reasonable expectations of persons occupying the area during the relevant time period. It is not the intent of this article to regulate speech, under either the Federal or Georgia Constitutions. This article has been narrowly tailored as a content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation to serve a significant governmental interest [5] while leaving open ample opportunity for communication. 
(b)  Definition of "noise". For purposes of this article, "noise" means a sound or sounds of any kind, that is repetitive or continuous, and of sufficient duration, that a person of reasonable auditory sensitivity would consider loud, unpleasant, unexpected, or undesirable. 
(c)  Sound measurement standards. For the purposes of this article, "plainly audible" shall mean any sound emanating from a specific sound-producing source which can be heard from the distances set forth below, using the following sound measurement standards: Measurement shall be by the auditory senses of a person standing at a distance no less than the required minimum distance from the source of the sound. Inasmuch as the limitation on noise is neutral as to the content of the message, if any, generated or conveyed by its source, words and phrases need not be discernable. For music and other noise, bass reverberations are included.

Sec. 50-1. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to life, health, and safety due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development activities which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(5)  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; and, 
(6)  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas. 
(b)  Applicability. This chapter shall be applicable to all areas of special flood hazard within the City of Griffin.

Sec. 50-3. - Basis for area of special flood hazard; flood area maps and studies. 
For the purposes of this chapter, the following are adopted by reference: 
(1)  The Flood Hazard Determinations (FHDs) by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to become effective June 7, 2017, modifying the Flood Insurance Study (FIS), effective May 3, 2010, for the City of Griffin, Georgia (Community No. 130165), with accompanying FIRM maps and other supporting data, and any future revision thereto, is hereby adopted by reference. For those land areas acquired by the municipality through annexation after May 3, 2010, the current effective FIS and data for Spalding County, Georgia, with accompanying FIRM maps and other supporting data, and any future revision thereto, are hereby adopted by reference. 
(2)  Other studies which may be relied upon for the establishment of the base flood elevation or delineation of the 100-year floodplain and flood-prone areas include: 
(a)  Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey or any other local, state or federal agency applicable to the City of Griffin; or 
(b)  Any base flood study authored by a registered professional engineer licensed in the State of Georgia which has been prepared using FEMA-approved methodology acceptable to the City of Griffin. 
(3)  Studies which may be relied upon for the establishment of the future-conditions flood elevations or delineation of the future-conditions floodplain and flood-prone areas include: 
(a)  Any flood or flood-related study conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey, or any other local, state or federal agency applicable to City of Griffin; or

( Ord. No. 17-07, § 1, 3-28-2017, eff. 4-1-2017 ) 
Sec. 50-4. - Compatibility with other regulations. 
Unless expressly repealed hereby, this chapter is not intended to modify or repeal any other Code section, chapter, rule, regulation, statute, easement, covenant, deed restriction or other provision of law. The requirements of this chapter are in addition to the requirements of any other Code section, chapter, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other Code section, chapter, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
( Ord. No. 17-07, § 1, 3-28-2017, eff. 4-1-2017 ) 
Sec. 50-5. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
This chapter is enacted in exercise of the police power in order to protect the general health, safety, and welfare of citizens and property within the City of Griffin, Georgia; and in furtherance of the mandate found in Art. I, Sec. I, Par. II of the 1983 Constitution of Georgia that protection of person and property is the paramount duty of government. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter, and the limitations imposed on owners of private property to use their property, is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on sound scientific and engineering considerations. In enactment of these restrictions, the governing body of the City of Griffin finds and concludes this chapter strikes a suitable balance between compelling governmental interests and private property rights, and that no undue burden is placed on private property owners. 
Conceptually, all land is subject to flooding. Larger floods can and will occur, above the level of flooding regulated by this chapter; the standards herein are deemed reasonable under common conditions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes beyond the legal control of the City of Griffin. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Griffin or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

Sec. 50-64. - General standards for development. 
(1)  Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway, also known as regulatory floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. Development is prohibited within a regulatory floodway. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply: 
(a)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill materials, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (b) below. 
(b)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways, and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and, 
(c)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the City of Griffin until an affirmative Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the City of Griffin. 
(2)  Floodplain development limited. Outside of the regulatory floodway, but within the future-conditions floodplain, no development shall be allowed that could result in any of the following: 
(a)  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation; 
(b)  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity; 
(c)  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or, 
(d)  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
(3)  [Development conditions.] Any development within the future-conditions floodplain allowed under subparagraph (1) above shall meet the following conditions: 
(a)  No fill material shall be permitted within the future-conditions floodplain; 
(b)  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
(c)  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
(d)  Verification of no-rise conditions, flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of section 50-66, signed and sealed by a professional engineer; 
(e)  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from flood waters; and 
(f)  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) to FEMA. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the City of Griffin using the Community Consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of construction, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys for a final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).

Sec. 50-65. - Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. 
An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of subsection 50-92(c) apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered Professional Engineer in the State of Georgia and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the City of Griffin prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
(1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
(2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the City of Griffin. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles; 
(3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
(4)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments.

Sec. 50-93. - Appeal procedures. 
The following appeal procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity within or immediately adjacent to an area of special flood hazard, including a building permit. A notice of appeal shall be filed with the city manager, within 30 days of the written denial, by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the City of Griffin for the reasons stated herein. 
(1)  All notices of appeal shall be heard and decided by the board of commissioners, after notice to all affected parties and an opportunity to be heard in an administrative hearing. The chairperson of the board of commissioners shall set the date, time and location for the hearing, not less than 15 days following filing of the notice of appeal. The board shall affirm the denial of the permit, reverse the denial based upon the preponderance of the evidence that the permit should be issued, or grant a variance as provided in this section. The decision of the board of commissioners shall be final. 
(2)  Any person aggrieved by a final decision of the board of commissioners may petition the Superior Court of Spalding County for a Writ of Certiorari, within 30 days of the issuance of a written decision by the board of commissioners. 
(3)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of Historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(4)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this chapter are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(5)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(6)  In hearing appeals, the board of commissioners shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
(7)  Conditions for variances: 
(a)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
(i)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and, 
(iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
(b)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(c)  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(d)  The city manager shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(8)  Any person appealing the denial of a permit shall submit such information and documentation as the board of commissioners shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request. The burden shall rest upon the appellant to support the record by a preponderance of relevant evidence. 
(9)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the board of commissioners may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this chapter. 
(10)  Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."

Before taking any of the following actions or imposing any of the following penalties, the city manager shall first notify the applicant or other responsible person in writing of its intended action, and shall provide a reasonable opportunity, of not less than ten days (except, that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, 24 hours notice shall be sufficient) to cure such violation. In the event the applicant or other responsible person fails to cure such violation after such notice and cure period, the city manager may take any one or more of the following actions or impose any one or more of the following actions: 
(1)  Stop work order. The city manager may issue a stop work order which shall be served on the applicant or other responsible person. The stop work order shall remain in effect until the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violation or violations described therein, provided the stop work order may be withdrawn or modified to enable the applicant or other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such violation or violations. 
(2)  Withhold certificate of occupancy.

(d)  Criminal penalties. For intentional and flagrant violations of this chapter, the city manager may issue a citation to the applicant or other responsible person, requiring such person to appear in municipal court to answer charges for such violation. Upon conviction, such person shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00, imprisonment for six months, or both. Each act of violation and each day upon which any violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense.

Within 30 days immediately following final adoption of this section, the city manager shall give written notification of such district designation to each owner at such address as last shown in the records of the Spalding County Tax Commissioner for the mailing of tax notices, apprising the owner of the necessity for obtaining a certificate of appropriateness prior to undertaking any material change in appearance of the property listed within the historic district, and of the right of aggrieved property owners, within 30 days of receiving such notice, to file a petition in the Superior Court of Spalding County, Georgia, for declaratory judgment as to the appropriateness of such designation. 
(Ord. No. 07-12, § 1, 10-23-2007) 
Sec. 55-5. - Certificate of appropriateness required; building permits. 
(a)  After the designation by ordinance of a historic property or of a historic district, no material change in the appearance of the historic property or of a structure, site, or work of art within the historic district shall be made or be permitted to be made by the owner or occupant thereof unless and until application for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted to and approved by the commission. Such application shall be accompanied by such drawings, photographs, or plans as may be required by the commission. 
(b)  In all cases where a certificate of appropriateness is required by this chapter, the city manager or his designated representative charged with issuance of building permits, shall not issue any building permit for work of any nature that may materially change the appearance of the historic property or structure, unless the certificate is granted. The rejection of a certificate of appropriateness shall be binding on the city manager or other officer charged with issuing building permits. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in or on a historic property, which maintenance or repair does not involve a material change in design, material, or outer appearance thereof, nor to prevent any property owner from making any use of his property not prohibited by other laws, ordinances, or regulations. 
(c)  The department of transportation and any contractors, including cities and counties, performing work funded by the department of transportation are exempt from this chapter. Local governments, including the city, are exempt from the requirement of obtaining certificates of appropriateness; provided, however, that local governments shall notify the commission not less than 45 days prior to beginning any undertaking within the historic district or affecting a historic property that would otherwise require a certificate of appropriateness and allow the commission an opportunity to comment. 
(Ord. No. 02-14, § 1(5), 8-27-2002) 
Sec. 55-6. - Certificate of appropriateness; applications; procedure; appeals. 
(a)  Prior to reviewing an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall take such action as may reasonably be required to inform the owners of any property likely to be affected materially by the application and shall give the applicant and such owners an opportunity to be heard. In cases where the commission deems it necessary, it may hold a public hearing concerning the application. 
(b)  The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change in appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the esthetic, historical, or architectural significance and value of the historic property or the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance; architectural style; general design, arrangement, texture, and material of the architectural features involved; and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style and pertinent features of other structures in the immediate neighborhood. 
(c)  In its review of applications for certificates of appropriateness, the commission shall not consider interior arrangement or uses having no effect on exterior architectural features. Present and intended land use of a historic property shall not be a factor in the commission's determination. 
(d)  The commission shall approve or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within 45 days after the filing thereof by the owner or occupant of a historic property or of a structure, site, or work of art located within a historic district. Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness issued by the commission. Failure of the commission to act within the 45 day period shall constitute approval, and no other evidence of approval shall be needed. 
(e)  In the event the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so in writing and shall transmit a record of such action and the reasons therefor, in writing, to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
(f)  Where such action is authorized in writing by the board of commissioners and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preservation of a unique historic property, the commission may enter into negotiations with the owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange, or otherwise of the property or any interest therein. 
(g)  Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this article would result in exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of any specific property, the commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to the provisions or to interpret the meaning of the provision so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided, however, that such variance, modification, or interpretation shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the provisions so that the architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will in its judgment best fulfill the purpose of this article. 
(h)  The commission shall keep a record of all applications for certificates of appropriateness and of all its proceedings. 
(i)  Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the board of commissioners and such governing body may, after conducting an administrative hearing, approve, modify and approve, or reject the determination made by the commission if the governing body finds that the commission abused its discretion in reaching its decision. The decision of the board of commissioners shall be made in writing, stating its findings and reasons, with a copy served upon all interested parties. The decision of the board of commissioners shall be final. Aggrieved parties may, within 30 days of a final decision, petition the Superior Court of Spalding County, Georgia, for a writ of certiorari. 
(Ord. No. 02-14, § 1(6), 8-27-2002) 
Sec. 55-7. - Building permits to conform to certificate of appropriateness. 
(a)  Building permits issued based upon a certificate of appropriateness shall be conformed to the requirements of such certificate. A certificate of appropriateness shall expire six months after its date of issuance unless a building permit is issued and work is commenced and diligently pursued. In the event work is not performed in accordance with the certificate, the city manager or his designated representative charged with construction standards and enforcement shall issue a stop work order and all work shall cease. 
(b)  The city manager shall be authorized to institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any material change in the appearance of a designated historic property or historic district, except those changes made in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, or to prevent any illegal act or conduct with respect to such historic property or historic district. 
(Ord. No. 02-14, § 1(7), 8-27-2002) 
Sec. 55-8. - Enforcement; penalties and fines. 
Any person who owns or occupies a building or structure that has been designated a historic property or that is located within a historic district, who shall intentionally do anything prohibited by this chapter, or who shall willfully fail to do anything required by this chapter that results in a material change in appearance of the designated property shall be cited to appear before the municipal court for violation of this chapter and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00. Each day a violation continues after initial citation shall constitute a separate offense. 
(Ord. No. 02-14, § 1(8), 8-27-2002) 
Chapter 57 - MEDIA PRODUCTIONS 

Sec. 57-1. - Purpose. 
It is the public policy of the State of Georgia to market the state as a location for media productions, recognizing the economic impact this industry provides, as well as the tourism it generates for local jurisdictions, such as the City of Griffin. The city is further fortunate to have a diverse number of unique locations to attract movies and television productions to the city. 
Despite the many positive benefits a media production may offer, certain inconveniences may result if the production company and city cannot work in concert to assure minimum standards are met and to assure a thoroughly-planned production schedule is followed. These concerns are best addressed through a regulatory permit. 
(Ord. No. 12-10, § 1, 8-28-2012) 
Sec. 57-2. - Scope of coverage. 
The permit required by this chapter shall be required for all movies, television or video series, pilots, feature films and documentaries, commercials, music videos, photo shoots, infomercials and public service announcements, whether the final product is intended for commercial use or not, unless the activity shall wholly occur on private property within an otherwise licensed facility (such as a film or television studio). Any media production on public property, intended to be closed to participation by the public, or restricting access to public property or facilities normally accessible by the public, shall require a permit. For purposes of this chapter, media production activity shall include areas designated for parking of trucks and equipment on public or private property, base camps used during the production activity, and food service areas. No public highway, street or road shall have its public access restricted or limited except by a permit issued pursuant to this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 12-10, § 1, 8-28-2012) 
Sec. 57-3. - Permit requirements. 
(a)  This permit is allowed with conditions in all zoning districts. Whenever a permit is sought for activities in primarily residential neighborhoods, extra consideration shall be given to the conditions imposed to ameliorate as much as possible inconvenience to the residents. 
(b)  Two classifications of media production permits are allowed: 
(1)  Low-impact activities are generally those activities having an intended duration of no more than 14 consecutive days, with little or no disruption to normal and customary use of the site and adjacent and nearby properties and uses; and 
(2)  High-impact activities are generally those activities having an intended duration of 15 or more consecutive days, which do not comply with the low-impact standards of this chapter, and/or will disrupt normal and customary use of the site and adjacent and nearby properties and uses. Any filming involving automobile crashes or chases, gunfire, pyrotechnics, explosives, the use of aircraft, stunts, and similar activities are examples of high-impact activities. 
(c)  General standards. Prior to making application for a permit, it shall be incumbent on the applicant to meet with the city manager and director of public safety, or their designees, to review locations and the general scope of activities planned during the production. A copy of the script shall be made available, upon request, to allow the city staff to better understand the applicant's needs. 
The following general standards shall apply to all permits: 
(1)  No tents, temporary sanitary facilities, trash collection, or food service facilities shall be located within 100 feet of the property line of any property used for residential use, unless the owner or tenant gives written consent; 
(2)  Tents, depending on their square footage, and other temporary structures may require a separate building permit from the city; any food preparation or food service provided at the location shall require a food service permit from the county health department, or evidence of exemption; 
(3)  Lighting for filming should be oriented away from adjacent or nearby properties as much as possible and shall not interfere with the safe movement of vehicular traffic; 
(4)  Temporary signage must be approved in writing, in advance, prior to erection, by the development director, or his designee; approval of temporary signage is conditioned restoration of permanent signage following completion of the media activity; 
(5)  No regulatory traffic control signage within a public right-of-way shall be removed without the prior written consent of the chief of police; 
(6)  No modification to any existing traffic signage, street light, traffic control device or other officially-installed facility or improvement shall be made without prior consent of the chief of police; 
(7)  No street, road, alley, or sidewalk shall be closed, barricaded or other obstruction erected within a public right-of-way, and no access shall be denied or restricted to public or private property or facilities unless the closure or restriction is approved as a condition of the permit; reasonable alternative access shall be arranged whenever possible; 
(8)  No trees, vegetation (including grasses), or ornamental shrubs shall be cut or removed from public property without prior written consent of the city in the permit, based upon an agreed landscape restoration plan. A land disturbance permit may be separately required depending upon the nature and extent of the activity. 
(9)  Traffic management plan. The applicant shall submit to the chief of police a traffic management plan to address traffic flow in the vicinity of the location where production activity is to occur, even if normal traffic flow is not to be obstructed or interrupted. Detours shall be determined and approved by the chief of police; temporary traffic control devices and signage as required by the manual on uniform traffic control devices shall be provided at the sole expense of the applicant; the city fire marshal shall also review and approve such plan. 
(10)  The City of Griffin shall be listed in the production credits for all permits required. 
(Ord. No. 12-10, § 1, 8-28-2012) 
Sec. 57-4. - Low-impact activity standards. 
In addition to the general standards, the following minimum standards shall be met in order to be permitted as a low-impact activity. Due to the varying requirements of media productions and nature of the industry, these standards are not intended to be all inclusive and additional conditions may be reasonably imposed, as warranted, to minimize anticipated adverse effects. 
(a)  No permit shall be effective for more than 14 consecutive dates from its date of issuance. Permits may be extended by the city manager, for reasonable cause, provided a daily filming fee shall apply. A single application shall include all locations for the same production within the city. Application shall be made no less than ten business days prior to the first scheduled event or day of filming. The permit shall be available, on location, at all times while production activity is occurring and shown to city inspectors upon request. 
(b)  Normal hours of activity shall be 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. daily; all preparation and wrap-up shall occur within one hour of this time frame. Noise shall be kept to a minimum. 
(c)  No street closure, obstruction or interference with normal traffic flow, including pedestrian use of sidewalks and public rights-of-way shall occur, including use of on-street parking spaces or parking in alleys or side streets. 
(d)  Facilities and locations to be used for base camp, food service, and parking shall be approved as a condition of the permit; any other required permit(s) shall be obtained prior to issuance of the permit under this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 12-10, § 1, 8-28-2012) 
Sec. 57-5. - High-impact activity standards. 
In addition to the general standards, the following minimum standards shall be met in order to be permitted as a high-impact activity. Due to the varying requirements of media productions and nature of the industry, these standards are not intended to be all inclusive and additional conditions may be reasonably imposed, as warranted, to minimize anticipated adverse effects. 
(a)  No permit shall issue for a term of less than 15 consecutive days from its date of issuance; the duration of the permit shall be based upon an agreed production schedule submitted by the applicant. Permits may be extended by the city manager, for reasonable cause, provided a daily filming fee shall apply. A single application shall include all locations for the same production within the city.

Noise shall be kept to a minimum; any activity occurring outside of the above hours involving planned noises in excess of 65 db at a distance of 100 feet from the point of origin shall be addressed in the application. If activity is planned within 500 feet of a residential area outside the hours specified, or will involve noises in excess of 65 db, notice shall be given by the best means available to residents as far in advance as reasonable. 
(c)  Street closure(s), obstruction or interference with normal traffic flow, including pedestrian use of sidewalks and public rights-of-way shall be detailed in the application, including any use of on-street parking spaces and/or parking in alleys or side streets. 
(d)  The city will not intervene on behalf of any permittee or negotiate access rights to private property with property owners; the permittee is expected to deal directly with private property owners for required permission and consent. 
(e)  Facilities and locations to be used for base camp, food service, and parking shall be approved as a condition of the permit; any other required permit(s) shall be obtained prior to issuance of the permit under this chapter. 
(f)  Based upon the proposed scope of production activity and in consideration of any potential danger to the safety, health and welfare of the community, particularly private property and residents near the location, the chief of police and/or city fire marshal may require on-site security (qualified private security or use of off-duty law enforcement officers) and/or may require personnel and equipment be placed on standby for portions of the high-impact activity at the expense of the applicant. The application shall detail the planned time, place, and manner of any of the following production activities: pyrotechnics, demolition, discharge of firearms or other weapons, motor vehicle chases, physical stunts, and similar actions. 
(Ord. No. 12-10, § 1, 8-28-2012) 
Sec. 57-6. - Application and permit procedure.

The minimum limits of insurance coverage shall not be less than $1,000,000.00 per occurrence. 
(f)  All applications shall be filed with the city manager, or his designee, who may require such additional information as needed to assess the proposed extent and intensity of the production within the city.

Sec. 58-2. - Disorderly conduct. 
(a)  The term "disorderly conduct" shall mean the commission of such words, acts, and conduct upon public property, upon private property that is open to the general public, or within the curtilage of any private residence not his own other than by invitation of the owner or lawful occupant, which under ordinary circumstances will naturally tend to disturb the public peace, tranquility, or decorum, scandalize the community, or shock the public sense of morality.

(2)  Use of obscene, vulgar, opprobrious, or abusive language, without provocation, which by its very utterance tends to incite an immediate breach of the peace; that is to say, words which as a matter of common knowledge and under ordinary circumstances will, when used to another person in the presence of the speaker, tend to provoke violent resentment; that is, words commonly called "fighting words"; 
(3)  Being and appearing in an intoxicated condition which is outwardly made manifest by boisterousness; by indecent condition or act such as to offend sentiments of delicacy and modesty universally recognized in civilized society; or by loud, vulgar, profane, opprobrious, abusive or unbecoming language, which by its very utterance tends to incite an immediate breach of the peace;

(c)  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prevent the peaceful assembly of citizens in a lawful manner, the free exercise of protected speech, nor shall the mere possibility of disorder justify the exclusion of persons otherwise entitled to be present. 
(d)  Any person charged with a violation of this section shall have the right, upon written demand filed with the clerk of the municipal court and a copy thereof served upon the city attorney, to a jury trial, upon a finding by the municipal court that probable cause exists to bind the case over to the appropriate state court.

The permit shall be for a limited time not to exceed 30 days and for use only upon the applicant's property. Not more than two permits in any one calendar year shall be issued for any one property location. The permit may be revoked for cause by the chief of police at any time without notice. No person holding such permit shall at any time discharge such firearm in the direction of any street, public way, house or property, or person of another. No person shall discharge such firearm at night or on Sunday or at other times so as to work a nuisance or cause annoyance of other citizens in the use and enjoyment of their property.

No person shall give false information in his written application.

Sec. 58-4. - Loitering. 
(a)  A person commits the offense of loitering when he is in a place at a time or in a manner not usual for law-abiding citizens under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property within the vicinity. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in loitering within the city. 
(b)  Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon the appearance of a police officer, refuses to identify himself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or any object. Immediate concern for the safety of persons or property may arise from observing a person or persons remaining idle in essentially one location, whether within or without a motor vehicle, having no obvious purpose or intent. 
(c)  Unless flight by the person or other circumstances make it impracticable, a police officer shall, prior to arrest for an offense under this section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel an alarm or immediate concern which would otherwise be warranted by requesting the person to identify himself and explain his presence of conduct. 
(d)  This section shall not preclude a police officer from arresting any individual for criminal trespass where such individual knowingly and without authority remains on public or private property after being lawfully notified to depart.

ADDENDUM TO THE  GEORGIA MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES BENEFIT SYSTEM  DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN ADOPTION AGREEMENT 
This is an addendum to the adoption agreement completed by the City of Griffin, Georgia. It modifies the adoption agreement in the following ways:

N/A 
2.  Discontinuance of participation in the plan by one or more departments or classes of employees (for amendment of adoption agreement only—see section 64-326 of adoption agreement): 
N/A 
3.  Special eligibility service requirement for regular employees (see section 64-327 regarding waiting period): 
Notwithstanding the provision entitled "waiting period" on page 7 of the adoption agreement [section 64-327], there is no waiting period for participation in the plan. Eligible regular employees employed by the city on April 16, 2005, will be eligible to begin participation in the plan as of April 16, 2005. Eligible regular employees initially employed after such date will be eligible to begin participating in the plan as of their first day of employment with the city. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the master plan or adoption agreement to the contrary, any person who is or becomes classified as a part-time, seasonal, or temporary employee under the city's personnel policy (in effect as of April 16, 2005, or as amended in the future), shall not be (or no longer be) eligible to participate in the plan. However, if a temporary or seasonal employee is reclassified as a regular, full-time employee under the city's personnel policies, then employee may commence participation in the plan as of the effective date of said reclassification, and the employee may receive credit for prior full-time service (at least 30 hours per week) as a temporary or seasonal employee. 
4.  Credited past service under the plan for newly eligible classes of employees (see subsection 64-329(a) of adoption agreement regarding past credited service):

N/A 
6.  Alternative early retirement actuarial reduction table for one or more classes of eligible employees (see article VI, section 2 of master plan regarding early retirement benefit): 
N/A 
7.  Other: 
(a)  Definition of "final average earnings" or "average annual compensation". Final average earnings shall be defined as the average earnings during the five consecutive years (12-month periods) of employment with the city in which the participant received the greatest aggregate amount of earnings. For purposes of this calculation, and notwithstanding any provision of the master plan or adoption agreement to the contrary, the term "earnings" shall mean annual cash earnings based on the city's pay scale, including longevity pay but excluding overtime pay. Earnings shall also not include perquisites or allowances for use of a car or house rent. Earnings and final average earnings shall be determined by the pension committee secretary and reported to GMEBS in accordance with this provision. 
(b)  Definition of disability; disability qualifications. A participant must have at least five years of credited service and must have become an employee of the city before July 1, 1995, in order to apply for disability retirement benefits under this plan. Notwithstanding any provision of the master plan or adoption agreement to the contrary, disability retirement benefits shall be administered in accordance with and subject to the provisions of section 19A-2.4 of the retirement benefit plan for city employees, as adopted by the board of commissioners on June 13, 1995, as Ordinance Number 95-8, and published in the 1968 City Code of Griffin, Georgia, as Chapter 19A (hereinafter referred to in this addendum as "the predecessor plan"). The terms of said section 19A-2.4 are incorporated herein by reference; provided, however, that: 1) the pension Committee as defined in section 64-321 of the adoption agreement, not the board of trustees, shall be responsible for determining whether a participant is eligible for disability retirement benefits under section 19A-2.4 and for approving applications for said benefits; and 2) the amount of the disability benefit shall be computed in the same manner as the normal retirement benefit as provided in section 64-331 of the adoption agreement. For purposes of determining eligibility for benefits, the definition of "total disability" and "total disability benefit" in section 19A-1 of the predecessor plan shall control, notwithstanding any provision in the master plan or adoption agreement to the contrary. 
(c)  Retirement formula under predecessor plan; "basic compensation" table. Participants who are vested as of April 15, 2005, under the terms of the predecessor plan are entitled to receive a monthly retirement benefit that is no less than the monthly retirement benefit that would be payable under the terms of the predecessor plan. The benefit that would be payable under the terms of the predecessor plan shall be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of sections 19A-1 and 19A-2.2 of the predecessor plan, without taking into account subsection (c) of section 19A-2.2. For purposes of determining the benefit that would be payable under the terms of the predecessor plan, "basic compensation" shall be as defined in section 19A-1 of the predecessor plan, utilizing the table contained in said definition. 
(d)  Cost-of-living adjustment. As of July 1, 2005, and each July 1 thereafter, each retired participant and beneficiary who is receiving a retirement, disability, or death benefit as of said date shall be entitled to receive a three percent cost-of-living adjustment in his or her monthly benefit payment. The monthly benefit payable immediately prior to July 1, 2005, and immediately prior to each July 1 thereafter shall be multiplied by .03 and the resulting amount shall be the adjusted monthly benefit payable for the ensuing 12-month period (July 1—June 30). If as of any July 1, a retired participant or beneficiary has not been receiving monthly benefits for the entire preceding 12-month period, he or she will receive a pro rate adjustment based on the number of monthly payments received for the preceding 12-month period (e.g., if six monthly payments have been made as of July 1, the adjustment will be one half of three percent or 1½ percent). The annual cost-of-living adjustment will first be included in monthly benefit checks for the month of July, which will be issued at the end of said month. If a participant or beneficiary's monthly benefit payments commence as of July 1 in any year, the first annual three-percent adjustment will be made the following July 1. Except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any provision of the predecessor plan to the contrary, no other cost-of-living adjustments, bonus adjustments, or other adjustments will be made on or after April 16, 2005. 
(e)  Retirement benefits for terminated vested employees. With respect to payment of retirement benefits, employees who terminated employment with a vested retirement benefit prior to April 16, 2005, and who do not return to employment with the city (hereinafter referred to as "terminated vested employees") shall be governed by the terms of the predecessor plan in effect as of the date of their termination, except as otherwise provided in this subsection. Early retirement benefits and the rule of 75 alternative normal retirement benefit shall not be payable to or on behalf of said terminated vested employees. Monthly benefit payment options available to terminated vested employees who become eligible for a normal retirement benefit shall be the same as those available to participants under the GMEBS master plan. Actuarial assumptions and factors used to determine retirement or survivor benefits payable to or on behalf of terminated vested employees shall be those specified in the GMEBS master plan. In determining the monthly normal retirement benefit amount payable to terminated vested employees and the normal retirement date upon which said benefit becomes payable, GMEBS is directed to utilize the listing of inactive vested employees provided to GMEBS by the city which reflects the normal retirement benefit amount and normal retirement date for each terminated vested employee. Provided, however, that this provision shall not create a duty to notify terminated vested employees of their entitlement to a normal retirement benefit or a duty to pay normal retirement benefits until application for said benefits is made by the terminated vested employee. 
(f)  Pre-retirement death benefits. The "auto A" in-service pre-retirement death benefit (see adoption agreement section 64-333) and the "auto A" terminated vested death benefit (see adoption agreement section 64-333) shall be payable in accordance with the provisions of the master plan and adoption agreement, notwithstanding any provision of the predecessor plan to the contrary. However, if the pre-retirement beneficiary to whom the pre-retirement benefit is payable is a child as defined in article II, section 9 of the master plan, then the auto A death benefit otherwise payable to the child will be actuarially adjusted to provide for payment until the child attains age 22, or if later, until the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. If the child dies before benefits are due to cease under this provision, no further benefits will be payable. Pre-retirement benefits will not be paid in the form of a single lump sum, except as otherwise provided by the master plan with respect to small benefit cash-outs. 
(g)  Pre-retirement death benefits for terminated vested employees. Notwithstanding any provision of the predecessor plan to the contrary, with respect to payment of pre-retirement benefits, employees who terminated employment with a vested retirement benefit prior to April 16, 2005, and who do not return to employment with the city (hereinafter "terminated vested employees") shall be governed by the terms of subsection (f), except as otherwise provided herein. Notwithstanding subsection (f), the pre-retirement death benefit payable to terminated vested employees shall be equal to the survivor's portion of the actuarial equivalent 50 percent joint and survivor annuity as described in the GMEBS master plan, which shall be calculated based upon the normal retirement benefit amounts reflected in the listing of inactive vested employees provided to GMEBS by the city. If the pre-retirement beneficiary to whom the death benefit is payable is the terminated vested employee's spouse as defined in article II, section 56 [of the master plan], then the spouse may defer receipt of the death benefit until what would have been the terminated vested employee's normal retirement date. If the pre-retirement beneficiary is not the spouse, the death benefit shall be payable as of the first day of the month coinciding with or following the date of the terminated vested employee's death. The death benefit will be actuarially reduced to reflect payments made prior to the date that would have been the terminated vested employee's normal retirement date. Actuarial assumptions and factors used to determine pre-retirement death benefits payable on behalf of terminated vested employees shall be those specified in the GMEBS master plan. This provision shall not create a duty to notify terminated vested employees or their beneficiaries of their entitlement to a pre-retirement death benefit, nor shall it create a duty to pay pre-retirement death benefits until application for said benefits is made by the terminated vested employee. 
(h)  Timing of distributions. Distribution of retirement benefits will commence as of the participant's effective retirement date as determined under the GMEBS master plan, but in no case before a participant files a claim for benefits. Notwithstanding section 19A-4.2 of the predecessor plan, monthly retirement benefit payments will not be prorated. 
(i)  Indemnification. In the event that GMEBS or GMA (including their officers, directors, or employees) is made a party to any claim arising out of or concerning administration of the predecessor plan (including, but not limited to, claims concerning eligibility for benefits, benefit calculation or payment, employee contributions, plan investments, plan funding, record-keeping, or regulatory compliance) or any claim arising out of or concerning differences between the terms of this plan and the predecessor plan, then to the extent allowed by law, the city shall indemnify and hold GMA and GMEBS harmless for any and all judgments, settlements, and costs, including attorney fees ("loss"), that GMEBS or GMA incurs or pays in connection therewith. 
(j)  Transfer of assets. The city will take all necessary steps to effect the transfer of all plan assets currently held for participants and beneficiaries of the predecessor plan to the board of trustees of the Georgia Municipal Employees Benefit System (GMEBS). Said transfer shall be effected by the city no later than April 16, 2005, or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, utilizing transfer methods and/or procedures mutually agreed upon between the city and GMEBS. Upon the acceptance and execution of the adoption agreement and this addendum by the city and by the authorized officer of GMEBS, and after said transfer of assets, the board of trustees of the GMEBS shall serve as successor trustees to the board of trustees established under the predecessor plan with respect to assets transferred to GMEBS and shall be responsible for administration of the retirement plan and investment of transferred plan assets in accordance with and subject to the terms of O.C.G.A. 47-5-1 et seq., the GMEBS master plan, adoption agreement, and the GMEBS trust agreement. 
(k)  Obligations of trust fund. Obligations of the city's retirement trust fund shall not be payable from or charged upon any other funds of the city. Obligations of the trust fund shall not constitute a charge, lien, or encumbrance, legal or equitable, on any property, real or personal, of the city, nor shall they constitute a pledge of the taxing authority of said city. 
(l)  Amendments. The board of commissioners may amend the benefit elections in the adoption agreement at any time, but no amendment shall have the effect of decreasing the described retirement benefit of anyone who is a vested participant on the date the amendment is adopted or becomes effective, whichever is later. This subsection shall operate in lieu of article XVIII, sections 1(a) and (c) of the master plan.

Moreover, the Plan will credit the Participant's qualified military service as service for vesting purposes, as though the Participant had resumed employment under USERRA immediately prior to the Participant's death. 
3.2  Benefit accrual. If the Employer elects in Amendment Section 2.2 to apply this Section 3.2, then effective as of the date specified in Amendment Section 2.2, for benefit accrual purposes, the Plan treats an individual who dies or becomes disabled (as defined under the terms of the Plan) while performing qualified military service with respect to the Employer as if the individual had resumed employment in accordance with the individual's reemployment rights under USERRA, on the day preceding death or disability (as the case may be) and terminated employment on the actual date of death of disability. 
a.  Determination of benefits. The Plan will determine the amount of employee contributions and the amount of elective deferrals of an individual treated as reemployed under this Section 3.2 for purposes of applying paragraph Code § 414(u)(8)(C) on the basis of the individual's average actual employee contributions or elective deferrals for the lesser of: (i) the 12-month period of service with the Employer immediately prior to qualified military service; or (ii) the actual length of continuous service with the Employer. 
3.3  Differential wage payments. For years beginning after December 31, 2008: (i) an individual receiving a differential wage payment, as defined by Code § 3401(h)(2), is treated as an employee of the employer making the payment; (ii) the differential wage payment is treated as compensation for purposes of Code § 415(c)(3) and Treas. Reg. § 1.415(c)-2 (e.g., for purposes of Code § 415, including the definition of post-severance compensation for deferral purposes under Treas. Reg. § 1.457-4(d)(1); and (iii) the Plan is not treated as failing to meet the requirements of any provision described in Code § 414(u)(1)(C) (or corresponding plan provisions) by reason of any contribution or benefit which is based on the differential wage payment.

Differential wage payments (as described herein) will also be considered compensation for all Plan purposes unless otherwise elected at Amendment Section 2.2.

3.4  Deemed Severance. Notwithstanding Section 3.3(i), if a Participant performs service in the uniformed services (as defined in Code § 414(u)(12)(B)) on active duty for a period of more than 30 days, the Participant will be deemed to have a severance from employment solely for purposes of eligibility for distribution of amounts not subject to Code § 412. However, the Plan will not distribute such a Participant's account on account of this deemed severance unless the Participant specifically elects to receive a benefit distribution hereunder. If a Participant elects to receive a distribution on account of this deemed severance, then the individual may not make an elective deferral or employee contribution during the 6-month period beginning on the date of the distribution. If a Participant would be entitled to a distribution on account of a deemed severance, and a distribution on account of another Plan provision (such as a qualified reservist distribution), then the other Plan provision will control and the 6-month suspension will not apply. 
ARTICLE IV - WAIVER OF 2009 REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS 
4.1  Suspension of RMDs unless otherwise elected by Participant. This paragraph does not apply if the Employer elected Amendment Section 2.3 b, c, or d. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Plan relating to required minimum distributions under Code § 401(a)(9), a Participant or Beneficiary who would have been required to receive required minimum distributions for 2009 but for the enactment of Code § 401(a)(9)(H) ("2009 RMDs"), and who would have satisfied that requirement by receiving distributions that are (1) equal to the 2009 RMDs or (2) one or more payments in a series of substantially equal distributions (that include the 2009 RMDs) made at least annually and expected to last for the life (or life expectancy) of the Participant, the joint lives (or joint life expectancy) of the Participant and the Participant's designated Beneficiary, or for a period of at least 10 years ("Extended 2009 RMDs"), will not receive those distributions for 2009 unless the Participant or Beneficiary chooses to receive such distributions. Participants and Beneficiaries described in the preceding sentence will be given the opportunity to elect to receive the distributions described in the preceding sentence. 
4.2  Continuation of RMDs unless otherwise elected by Participant. This paragraph does not apply if Amendment Section 2.3 a, c, or d is selected. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Plan relating to required minimum distributions under Code § 401(a)(9), a Participant or Beneficiary who would have been required to receive required minimum distributions for 2009 but for the enactment of Code § 401(a)(9)(H) ("2009 RMDs"), and who would have satisfied that requirement by receiving distributions that are (1) equal to the 2009 RMDs or (2) one or more payments in a series of substantially equal distributions (that include the 2009 RMDs) made at least annually and expected to last for the life (or life expectancy) of the Participant, the joint lives (or joint life expectancy) of the Participant and the Participant's designated Beneficiary, or for a period of at least 10 years ("Extended 2009 RMDs"), will receive those distributions for 2009 unless the Participant or Beneficiary chooses not to receive such distributions. Participants and Beneficiaries described in the preceding sentence will be given the opportunity to elect to stop receiving the distributions described in the preceding sentence. 
4.3  Direct Rollovers. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Plan relating to required minimum distributions under Code § 401(a)(9), and solely for purposes of applying the direct rollover provisions applicable to an Employer sponsoring a Governmental Eligible 457 Plan, certain additional distributions in 2009, as elected by the Employer in Amendment Section 2.3, will be treated as eligible rollover distributions. If no election is made by the Employer in Amendment Section 2.3, then a direct rollover will be offered only for distributions that would be eligible rollover distributions without regard to Code § 401(a)(9)(H). 
ARTICLE V - PARTICIPANT ELECTION OF TIME AND METHOD 
5.1  Participant Election of Time and Method. The Employer in the Adoption Agreement must elect whether to permit Participants to elect the timing and method of distribution of their Account in accordance with Plan Section 4.02. The Plan Administrator must consent to the specific terms of any such Participant election and the Plan Administrator in its sole discretion may withhold consent. Subject to the foregoing conditions, a Participant: (1) may elect to postpone distribution of his/her Account beyond the time the Employer has elected in its Adoption Agreement, to any fixed or determinable date including, but not beyond, the Participant's required beginning date; and (2) may elect the method of payment. Effective as of the date this Plan amendment is adopted, a Participant may elect the timing and method of payment of his/her Account prior to the date the Plan Administrator or Trustee first would commence payment of the Participant's Account in accordance with the Adoption Agreement.

It is the purpose of this article to establish procedures to regulate solid waste handling, storage and collection by the city solid waste department and by those private collectors licensed to collect, store and handle solid waste generated from commercial and industrial sources within this city and to secure reliable data for solid waste management planning as part of the city's goal for wasteload reduction. 
(b)  It is further declared to be the policy of the city to educate and encourage generators and handlers of solid waste to reduce and minimize to the greatest extent possible the amount of solid waste which requires collection, treatment, or disposal through source reduction, reuse, composting, recycling, and other methods and to promote markets for and engage in the purchase of goods made from recovered materials and goods which are recyclable. 
(c)  It is further declared to be the policy of the city that every effort be undertaken to ensure the proper management of scrap tires from the point of generation to the ultimate point of reuse, recycling, or disposal and that every effort be made to ensure that, where possible, they be reused or recycled rather than being disposed. 
(d)  It is further declared to be the policy of the city that nature's way of recycling vegetative matter be respected and followed and that essential landfill space no longer be wasted by such materials being collected and buried in landfills, but allowed to decompose and returned to the soil. The city therefore recommends natural, low-maintenance landscaping requiring little or no cutting, using drought-tolerant trees, plants and shrubs, and encourages its citizens follow these steps for handling yard waste: 
(1)  Grass should be recycled by mowing it and letting the clippings lie; 
(2)  Leaves should be left where they fall, or mowed and composted; 
(3)  Woody material should be chipped on the site where such material was generated, or cut for use as fiber fuel; and 
(4)  Composting on the site where the material was grown, followed by incorporation of the finished compost into the soil at that site. 
(e)  The owner and/or occupant of every premises within the city shall be ultimately responsible for the proper handling, storage and disposal of all solid waste generated upon the property.

Sec. 74-33. - Collection of residential solid waste. 
(a)  Receipt of service required. In order to protect the public health and sanitation, to prevent the spread of contagious or infectious diseases, and to prevent the breeding of rodents, insects and other vermin, all improved residential properties (single-family and multifamily residences) within the city shall receive regular municipal solid waste collection services from the city solid waste department.

Such fee shall be imposed against the property itself and payment of the fee shall be enforceable and collected as provided by law for levy and sale of in rem liens. 
(b)  Outside storage of residential solid waste; curbside containers. All residential solid waste, except newspapers, stored outside the residence pending collection shall be placed inside approved containers with lids tightly affixed. Approved containers shall be those issued by the city to residential customers pursuant to this article, designed to be rolled to curbside for periodic collection. All waste must be bagged and placed inside the container. Under no circumstances will garbage outside of city-issued containers be collected. If necessary, extra containers may be obtained for an additional monthly fee, as determined by the current fee schedule in affect at the time such additional cart is provided. Each container shall bear a serial number and shall be registered to the assigned customer. All containers shall remain the property of the city. Additionally, in the event a container is lost, stolen or intentionally damaged, the city reserves the right to charge the customer the replacement cost of the container. Except when taken to the curbside for scheduled collection, containers shall be consistently located behind the residence and outside of fenced enclosures in which animals are kept. Containers shall be used exclusively for the storage and transport of solid waste to the curbside. 
(c)  Time and placement of containers. By 6:30 a.m. on the scheduled day for collection, customers should place their containers at curbside in front of the customer's residence. Both the solid waste and recycling containers should be placed approximately four feet from the edge of the roadway, but not so as to pose a physical or visual obstruction to motorists. Both containers may be placed at curbside the night before the scheduled day for collection; for example, if the scheduled day for collection is Monday, containers may be placed at curbside on Sunday evening. All carts shall be placed with the front of the cart squarely facing the roadway, so as to be capable of being picked up by automated collection equipment. Where there is insufficient right-of-way adjacent to the roadway, or other topographical difficulties exist which make it unreasonable to conform to the general requirements, customers should place their container at a location mutually agreeable to the customer and solid waste department, after consultation with the solid waste director or his designee. All containers shall be removed from the curbside and returned to a location behind the customer's residence no later than 6:30 a.m. following the scheduled day of service. Due to holidays or other unforeseen circumstances, special collection dates will be announced or published through the local news media. Customers are encouraged to make suitable arrangements with neighbors or friends to set out and remove their containers from the curbside if absent during the hours specified herein; customers routinely allowing containers to remain at curbside outside of the hours specified shall be deemed to create a nuisance, punishable as a violation of this Code. 
(d)  Assisted service for households with mobility-impaired residents. Households in which all regular residents are mobility-impaired may apply for assisted collection service at the same fee as levied for curbside collection. The containers must be placed at the street building line, visible from the street. Applications shall be made on forms provided by the solid waste department director or his designee, accompanied by the certificate of a physician licensed in the state stating that, based upon a physical examination conducted within the past 30 days, the applicant is mobility-impaired or has sufficient medical reasons not to place the container at curbside. Any denial of an application shall be in writing, stating the reason therefore. Aggrieved applicants may, within 20 days of the receipt of denial, request a hearing before the city manager, whose decision shall become final. The solid waste department may request recertification of a mobility-impaired customer annually. It shall be the duty of a mobility-impaired customer to report promptly to the solid waste department any change in medical condition or change in occupancy of the residence. 
(e)  Service for multifamily residential developments. 
(1)  Multifamily residential developments with three or less units. Residential developments of three or less dwelling units (detached, attached, duplex or triplex) located on the same tract or parcel shall be served with each unit being assigned a container for curbside collection. 
(2)  Multifamily residential developments with more than three units. All other multifamily developments (more than three units) shall be deemed as residential customers, but shall be serviced by a centrally located commercial container or compactor. It shall be the responsibility of each multifamily residential development to provide adequate containers for storage of its own waste. Before a building permit shall be issued for construction of a new multifamily development or before a certificate of occupancy is issued for a previously vacant multifamily development, arrangements for the storage and collection of solid waste shall be approved pursuant to city development regulations. Commercial containers at existing multifamily developments serviced by the city solid waste department shall be placed at locations approved by the solid waste director. 
(f)  Restrictions on residential solid waste other than household garbage. Municipal solid waste, other than household garbage, shall not be placed in containers nor mixed with residential solid waste. Cardboard boxes and related shipping materials should be broken down and securely bundled and left next to the container at curbside. Objects such as broken glass or hypodermic needles that may cause injury to sanitation workers shall be enclosed in nonpermeable containers with lids tightly affixed, before mixing with residential solid waste. 
(g)  Maintenance of surrounding area. The occupant of a single family residential dwelling shall be responsible for maintaining the area surrounding the container clean and free of litter. The owner of a multifamily residential unit shall be responsible for maintaining the area surrounding the container clean and free of litter. Upon failure of the occupant of a single family residential dwelling, and on premises which are not currently occupied, the owner shall have the duty to maintain the premises accordingly. 
(h)  Cleanliness of containers. All refuse and recycling containers, except single use containers, shall be kept clean and free of accumulated waste and shall be treated with an effective insecticide, if necessary, to prevent nuisance. 
(i)  Dangerous or corrosive materials. It shall be a violation of this article to place or cause to be placed in any refuse or recyclables container for collection any acid, explosive material, flammable liquids or dangerous or corrosive material of any kind. No person shall place a used lead-acid vehicle battery in mixed municipal solid waste or discard or otherwise dispose of a lead-acid vehicle battery except by delivery to a battery retailer or wholesaler, to a secondary lead smelter, or to a collection or recovered materials processing facility that accepts lead-acid vehicle batteries. 
(j)  Pet litter, disposable diapers, other similar waste. Pet litter, disposable diapers and other similar waste must be contained in a securely tied plastic bag before placing in a refuse container. 
(k)  Preparation of municipal solid waste. All municipal solid waste shall be free of liquid and placed in watertight plastic bags with the tops secured prior to being placed in a refuse container. 
(l)  Paint cans. Paint cans shall be collected if empty or if the paint therein is dry or solidified with sand or pet litter and the cans are placed at the curb with lids off. 
( Ord. No. 17-13, § 1, 8-22-2017 ) 
Sec. 74-34. - Collection of yard waste from residential customers and light commercial entities. 
(a)  Yard waste not to be mixed with municipal solid waste. It shall be unlawful to place or mix yard waste, as defined by this article, with municipal solid waste within a container intended for storage and collection of residential solid waste. All residential customers will be entitled to one biweekly collection of yard waste at curbside. For purposes of this article one biweekly load shall consist of a pile approximately eight feet by four feet by four feet in height. Bagged leaves and grass clippings will be excluded from the measurement of loads. Unbagged leaves will be included in the measurement of loads. Yard waste shall be placed on the right-of-way, in front of the residence, within approximately four feet of the roadway, provided no yard waste shall be placed so as to physically protrude into the roadway or visually obstruct any motorist. No yard waste shall be placed at a location where it is likely to wash or blow into the roadway, into a storm drain, or on or near fire hydrants, water meter boxes, mail boxes, utility poles or guy wires, in such manner as to obstruct access to the waste to be collected or to obstruct the function of the object. 
(b)  Regulations on yard waste. Limbs and branches shall be separated from grass clippings and leaves.

No establishment permitted under this section shall serve a patron more than one drink or container of an alcoholic beverage within the designated area at one time.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 18-04, § 1, adopted April 24, 2018 , repealed the former Art. III, §§ 78-61—78-70, and enacted a new Art. III as set out herein. The former Art. III pertained to parades and demonstrations and derived from Ord. No. 14-01, § 1, adopted Feb. 25, 2014. 
State Law reference— Preventing or disrupting lawful procession, O.C.G.A. § 16-11-34; operation of motorcycles and motor vehicles in parades, O.C.G.A. § 40-6-7; funeral processions, O.C.G.A. § 40-6-76; authority to regulate or prohibit processions or assemblages on the highways, O.C.G.A. § 40-6-371(a)(3). 

Sec. 78-61. - Purpose and intent. 
It is the purpose of this article to regulate parades, gatherings, assemblies, and demonstrations, and similar events that occupy or obstruct the safe and orderly passage of motor vehicles and pedestrians on, over and across the streets and public ways of the city, without regard to the content or any message conveyed by such activity. The City of Griffin recognizes that the First Amendment, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits a municipal government from restricting expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content; content-based regulations are presumptively unconstitutional and unenforceable. Therefore, it is the intent of the board of commissioners, in enacting this article, to be content-neutral and impose reasonable regulations, by date, time, place, manner, and location only. 
Further, this article involves a balancing of the right of the public to the free passage of citizens, either in motor vehicles, on foot, or by other means of conveyance, along, over and across the public streets and ways of the city against the First Amendment rights of citizens to exercise certain protected speech and activities on or within the city's streets, which the U.S. Supreme Court regards as quintessential public forums. It is the finding and conclusion of the board of commissioners that public safety and the protection and preservation of life and property, both public and private, are legitimate, significant, and compelling governmental interests which this article is intended to protect and regulate. It is further believed that the regulations imposed hereunder are narrowly tailored to achieve such purposes and reasonably protect such government interests, and that these regulations are the least restrictive measures that achieve such results. Finally, it is the intent of this board of commissioners to leave open adequate alternative avenues for communication.

Sec. 78-62. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Parade is any form of assembly, march, ceremony, demonstration, show, exhibit, pageant, road race (walk/run/bicycle or other form of conveyance), or procession of any kind, in, on, or upon any public street, sidewalk, park or other public place within the city, which impedes, obstructs, impairs or interferes with, free flow of traffic, by motor vehicles, pedestrians, or other conveyances within a public street or way. Any assembly on or within a public street that does not conform to the normal or usual traffic control devices shall be presumed to impede, obstruct, impair or interfere with the free flow of traffic on such street, highway, alley, sidewalk or other public way. 
Person is any person, firm, partnership, corporation or other form of recognized business entity, association, or organization, whether organized for profit or not-for-profit. 
( Ord. No. 18-04, § 1, 4-24-2018 ) 
Sec. 78-63. - Permit required. 
Permitting is a reasonable way for a local government to receive notice of an upcoming event, such as a parade, protest march, or assembly. By receiving advance notice of such event, the city has the opportunity to meet with event organizers, determine the location(s) where the event will take place, and to properly assess security and other needs for the event. The purpose for a permit under this section is not to restrict or suppress a person's right to engage in speech or expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment; rather it is to provide the city with reasonable advance notice of intended or planned assemblies that may interfere with or impede normal traffic flow and operation of vehicles and pedestrians upon a public street or way. In requiring a permit for planned assemblies, it is not the city's intent to suppress the spontaneous exercise of First Amendment rights, when such are occasioned by news or current affairs becoming public knowledge, or caused by reaction to some topical event, such as demonstrations for which a permit has been issued. No person shall engage in, participate in, organize, form, promote or aid in the start of any planned or organized parade, assembly, or demonstration that occupies or obstructs a public street or way of the city, unless a permit shall have been obtained from the city manager or his designee, or the event or activity is excepted from a permit by this article. 
( Ord. No. 18-04, § 1, 4-24-2018 ) 
Sec. 78-64. - Exceptions. 
This permit requirement of this article shall not apply to: 
(1)  Funeral processions formed and conducted in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 40-6-76(a); 
(2)  A government entity or agency acting within the scope of its legal authority, duties and functions; 
(4)  Picketing involving less than 30 persons and no vehicles or floats, whose route is confined solely to public sidewalks and which does not obstruct or impair normal traffic movement (vehicles or pedestrians) in, along, or on any public street, or encroach on private property adjacent to the sidewalk unless written permission is first obtained from the property owner, and which does not involve sound amplification or noises regulated by the city's noise pollution regulations; or 
(5)  On not less than 24 hours notice from the event organizer, the city manager shall have the discretion to waive the requirement for a permit for a spontaneous exercise of First Amendment rights, provided such exercise is wholly located on city-owned property in the block bounded by Slaton Street on the north, N. Fifth Street on the east; E. Solomon Street on the south, and N. Sixth Street on the west. This exception is provided to afford an alternative adequate avenue for communications protected by the First Amendment. In order to exercise the discretion afforded by this section, the city manager, or his designee, shall meet, in person, in advance, with the event organizer in order to determine the level of security required for citizens and property during the event. 
( Ord. No. 18-04, § 1, 4-24-2018 ) 
Sec. 78-65. - Permit—Application. 
An application for a parade permit shall be filed with the city tax and license clerk, who shall promptly convey the application to the chief of police or his designee, time being of the essence. Such application shall be on form(s) provided by the city and shall be filed not less than five calendar days prior to the proposed parade, assembly or demonstration. The application shall contain the following information:

(2)  The date and time of the parade or event; 
(3)  The proposed route of the parade, including its assembly and disassembly points, if permission is sought to shorten the route or follow a different route from that set forth in section 78-68 of this article; the proposed location(s) for a protest or demonstration, and the written consent of any private property owner on whose property the event is to occur; 
(4)  Approximate number of participants, and type of vehicles, animals, marching units, bands, and floats to be involved, including any sound amplification to be used; 
(5)  Estimate of the number of persons or spectators who may observe the event; 
(6)  Estimate of the maximum length of the parade and/or time during which street intersections along the parade route may be obstructed; 
(7)  Estimate whether any opposition or contra-demonstration is anticipated and what security measures, if any, the sponsor or organizer has taken to provide security for participants; 
(8)  A description of any unusual problems anticipated concerning traffic or public safety, or a statement that no unusual problems are anticipated; 
(9)  Where a separate permit is required by the Georgia Department of Transportation to occupy or obstruct a state route or highway, such permit shall be issued by GDOT as a condition precedent to applying for a city permit. 
(10)  All applications shall be signed by the event sponsor or organizer, who shall swear before a notary that the information contained therein is true and correct. Any false statement in an application shall be grounds for denial or revocation of a permit and/or denial of future permits.

Whenever possible, the police chief shall have a meeting, in person, with the event sponsor or organizer, who signed the application, to better understand the purpose and intent of the event and potential for hostile counter activity. The report shall contain findings as to whether all requirements of section 78-65 have been met. Further, the report shall assess the requirements for traffic and pedestrian safety in the vicinity of the event, including that of parade participants and observers, during and following the event. This investigation shall be completed within four calendar days of receipt of a complete application for permit; should the police chief fail to complete a report to the city manager within that time the application shall be deemed granted. 
( Ord. No. 18-04, § 1, 4-24-2018 ) 
Sec. 78-67. - Permit—Issuance or denial. 
By the fifth calendar day after filing of a complete application, the city manager shall review the application and the investigative report and recommendations of the police chief. The city manager, in recognition of his limited discretion to deny the permit, shall issue the permit unless he or she finds: 
(1)  The parade or event will be of such a size or nature that diverts public safety resources to such a degree that the rest of the city will be without reasonable police, fire, or life safety protection; 
(2)  The parade or event will encroach upon or interfere with another parade or event for which a permit has been previously approved; 
(3)  Information contained in the application is found to be false in any material aspect; or 
(4)  The sponsor refuses to agree to abide by and comply with the reasonable conditions of this article. 
No decision to deny a permit shall be based upon the message or expression of speech conveyed by such event, its ideas, or subject matter. All decisions to deny a permit shall be in writing, shall state, with specificity, the reason or reasons for permit denial, and shall be served upon the applicant, either in person or by statutory overnight delivery to the address given in the application. The decision of the city manager shall be final. An applicant aggrieved by a permit denial may file a petition for writ of certiorari to the Superior Court of Spalding County, Georgia asserting any alleged errors of law.

Sec. 78-68. - Regulations pertaining to all parades and events. 
(a)  All parades, except road races, shall assemble and start on the North Expressway (U.S. 19 and 41, Ga. 92 Business), south of its intersection with W. Ellis Road; thence, proceed south on the North Expressway to its intersection with Flynt Street, thence west on Flynt Street to its intersection with Spalding Street, then north on Spalding Street to its intersection with Varsity Drive, then east on Varsity Drive to its intersection with the North Expressway, thence north on the North Expressway to the point of origin, where the parade shall disband. To keep traffic congestion to a minimum, the sponsor or event organizer should seek written consent of commercial parking lot owners near the point(s) of assembly to allow gathering of participants, parking, and formation of units off-street, if possible. Buses and other vehicles used to transport participants to the assembly point shall be parked prior to the parade start. Uniformed policemen shall be posted at all intersections where the normal use of traffic-control devices will be interrupted during the parade or event. 
(b)  Road races shall be routed so as to minimize traffic congestion, particularly in the commercial business district and/or impacting federal or state highways; crossing of federal or state highways shall be kept to a minimum for safety purposes. Uniformed policemen shall be posted at all intersections where the normal use of traffic-control devices will be interrupted during the race event. At all other non-signalized intersections, it shall be the responsibility of the race organizer to post its own personnel, wearing an orange safety vest, to warn approaching motorists during the race event. 
(c)  In coordination with the Georgia Department of Transportation, since the North Expressway is a federal and state highway, parades using the route specified in subparagraph (a) above, shall only be conducted on Tuesdays and Thursdays between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 11:00 a.m., the hours of 1:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m., and the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.; and on Saturdays, and legal holidays between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 12:00 p.m., the hours of 1:30 p.m. and 4:30 p.m., and the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.

Participants parking or entering on private property without permission shall be subject to having their vehicles towed and impounded. 
(e)  All materials used in the construction of floats shall be fire-resistant and shall be subject to inspection with fire and life safety requirements by the city fire marshal. 
(f)  Drivers of all motorized vehicles, regardless of whether such vehicle is required to display a tag or proof of title, shall operate the vehicle in accordance with the Uniform Rules of the Road, as adopted by city ordinance, while participating in a parade or other permitted event. Any driver who operates a motor vehicle in an unsafe manner, as defined by O.C.G.A. § 40-6-251, may be cited accordingly. Drivers of vehicles in parades shall obey the lawful commands and instruction of police officers posted along the parade route. 
(g)  To prevent risk of injury to spectators and other parade participants, no objects shall be thrown from floats or vehicles in the parade. Handbills, leaflets, individually wrapped candy, or objects of a similar nature not likely to cause physical injury may be handed to spectators by participants walking outside of vehicles or floats. 
(h)  Where barricades, ropes, tape or similar devices are used to demarcate the limits of the parade route, spectators shall remain within or behind defined areas. Spectators shall not cross the parade route while the parade is in progress or in such a manner as to interfere with its progress. No objects may be thrown by spectators into the parade route or at parade participants. 
(i)  When animals are participating in a parade, it is the responsibility of the animal's handler to immediately remove any droppings from the public street or sidewalk. 
(j)  Parade participants are encouraged not to engage in speeches or debates during the parade or march, but may make speeches, debate and distribute literature at rallies or similar gatherings conducted at the conclusion of the parade, if suitable arrangements have been made off the public streets and sidewalks of the city. 
(k)  As a condition of every permit, permittee, its officers, agents and employees acknowledge that issuance of a permit by the city forms no special relationship between the city and event sponsor or organizer, any participant, observer or spectator in or at the permitted event or activity. All participants do so at their own risk. Permittees are encouraged, but not required to obtain and maintain adequate liability insurance for such permitted activity or event. 
( Ord. No. 18-04, § 1, 4-24-2018 ) 
Sec. 78-69. - Public conduct during parades. 
(a)  Interference. No person shall unreasonably hamper, obstruct, impede, or interfere with any parade or permitted event, or with any person, vehicle, or animal participating in a parade. 
(b)  Driving through parades or funeral processions. No driver of a vehicle shall drive between vehicles or persons comprising a parade when the parade is in progress or in motion, unless directed by authorized traffic control personnel. 
(c)  Parking on parade route. When in the sole judgment of the chief of police it is reasonably necessary to prohibit or restrict parking of vehicles along a street or highway constituting a part of the route of a parade, road race, or other permitted event, the police department shall post signs to that effect. It shall be unlawful for any person to park or leave an unattended vehicle in violation thereof. Offending vehicles may be towed and/or impounded.

Any permit issued pursuant to this article may be summarily revoked, without prior notice to the permit holder, by the city manager, if by reason of disaster, public calamity, riot, or other emergency, he or she determines that the safety of the public or property, public or private, is in peril. Whenever a permit is revoked under this section, a new permit for a rescheduled parade or event, if requested, shall be issued to the sponsor at no cost or charge. 
( Ord. No. 18-04, § 1, 4-24-2018 )

Nothing in this article shall relieve the sponsor or organizer of an event, as herein defined, from legal liability for any injuries or damages to persons or property, public or private, occasioned by any act or omission arising from the event for which a permit under this article was issued. The City of Griffin, merely by requiring and approving an event permit under this article, accepts no responsibility for the safety of persons participating in parades and events governed by this article, including spectators at such events.

(3)  The impact on safety, visual quality of the streets, traffic flow, and other users of the right-of-way and the difficulty and length of time of the project, construction or maintenance. 
(e)  Emergency situations. 
(1)  Each utility shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, notify the director of any event regarding its facilities which it considers to be an emergency. The utility may proceed to take whatever actions are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. A utility who engages in an emergency excavation shall take all reasonable precautions to avoid or minimize damage to any existing facilities. 
(2)  In the event that the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding utility facilities, the city may attempt to contact the affected utility or facilities representative. The city may take whatever action it deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, including cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers, appliances, or other parts of the facilities.

d.  Made a material misrepresentation or omission of fact in its permit application.

If the director decides there is cause or reason to terminate, the following procedure shall be followed: 
(1)  City shall serve a utility with a written notice of the reason or cause for proposed termination and shall allow a utility a minimum of 15 calendar days to cure its breach. 
(2)  If the utility fails to cure within 15 calendar days, the city may declare the permit terminated. 
(h)  Expiration of permit. If work is not begun within six months of the date of issuance, the permit will automatically expire.

Sec. 78-83. - Required minimum standards. 
(a)  Utility accommodation manual adopted. The 2009 Utility Accommodation Policy and Standards Manual, including all references contained therein to codes, rules, regulations, schedules, forms and appendix items, except Appendix B (Permit Forms and supporting Documents), promulgated by the State of Georgia Department of Transportation, as may be amended from time to time, is hereby adopted by reference and incorporated in this article as if fully set forth herein, subject to the amendments and modification contained herein. A copy of the manual shall be maintained in the offices of the director or his designee and open for public inspection and copying. Copies of the manual are also available on the Georgia Department of Transportation's website. Any conflicts between the provisions of this article and the manual shall be resolved in favor of the manual. References to state personnel, agencies, and fees shall be interpreted, where required, as meaning the City of Griffin municipal equivalents. 
(b)  Protection of traffic and roadway. Unless specifically in the permit, no utility may occupy city rights-of-way unless sufficient space is available so that the free flow and safety of traffic and other capacity considerations are not unduly impaired and the installation does not prevent the department from reasonably maintaining the streets, structures, traffic control devices and other appurtenant facilities, and further provided that maintenance and operations of the facilities do not jeopardize the traffic, street structure, other users of the right-of-way or the right-of-way itself. 
(c)  Grading. If the grades or lines of any street within the city right-of-way are changed at any time by the city or by federal or state highway authorities during the term of the permit and this change involves an area in which the utility's facilities are located, then the utility shall, at its own cost and expense and upon the request of the city upon reasonable notice, protect or promptly alter or relocate the facilities, or any part thereof, so as to conform with such new grades or lines. In the event the utility refuses or neglects to so protect, alter, or relocate all or part of the facilities, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter, or relocated all or any part of the facilities without any liability to the utility and the utility shall pay to the city the costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alteration, or relocation. 
(d)  Installation of poles and other wireholding structures and relocation. Unless otherwise provided in a valid service agreement, no placement of any pole or wireholding structure of the utility is to be considered a vested interest in the right-of-way, and such poles or structures are to be removed, relocated underground, or modified by the utility at its own expense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The facilities shall be so located and installed as to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 82-1. - Administration. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this article the finance officer shall be charged with the duty to administer the imposition, collection and enforcement of all taxes and special assessments levied or imposed by the city in accordance with the administrative procedures set forth in this article. To the extent this article fails to provide a designated procedure, such officer shall act in the manner established, if any, for county tax collectors under applicable state law. 
(b)  In determining the fair market value of property within its taxing jurisdiction, the city shall use the fair market value as finally determined for the property for county ad valorem tax purposes. 
(c)  Following adoption of its current fiscal year budget, the board of commissioners shall, by resolution, adopt a millage rate upon which property subject to ad valorem tax will be billed. Prior to adoption of such millage rate, the board of commissioners shall publish the notice of proposed ad valorem tax rate as required by O.C.G.A. § 48-5-32. Millage rates shall be calculated using 40 percent of the assessed fair market value of the property upon which the tax is levied. 
(d)  The finance officer shall cause a bill to be sent to all taxpayers at the address last shown on the county tax digest by regular U.S. mail, with adequate postage thereon; provided, however, failure by the taxpayer to receive a bill shall not constitute grounds for nonpayment or late payment of the tax. The bill shall state the location or description of the property taxed, the fair market value of the property (100 percent) and its taxable value (40 percent of fair market value), and the amount of tax due thereon. The bill shall also state the due date after which taxes shall be in default. The bill may also contain such additional information as allowed by law or authorized by the board of commissioners. 
(Code 1968, § 21-1) 
Cross reference— Administration, ch. 2. 
Sec. 82-2. - Due date; payment; interest on past due taxes. 
(a)  All ad valorem taxes shall be due and payable in full within 60 days after notice, unless the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, in which case it shall be postponed until the first day following which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Supplemental ad valorem taxes and special assessments shall be due and payable on the date set forth in the ordinance imposing the tax or assessment. 
(b)  All taxes and assessments imposed by the city shall be paid in full in legal tender of the United States; except where specially authorized by law or ordinance of the board of commissioners, no partial payments shall be accepted. 
(c)  Taxes and special assessments shall bear interest at an annual rate equal to the bank prime loan rate as posted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Statistical Release H.15, or any publication that may supercede it, plus three percent, to accrue monthly. Such annual interest rate shall be determined for each calendar year based on the first weekly posting of Statistical Release H.15 on or after January 1 of each calendar year. Interest shall begin to accrue from the date the tax is due until the date the tax is paid. Any period less than one month shall be considered to be one month. The finance officer may waive the collection of any interest, in whole or in part, due the city on unpaid taxes or assessments whenever or to the extent that he reasonably determines that the delay in payment was attributable to the action or inaction of his department. 
(Code 1968, § 21-2; Ord. No. 16-14, § 1, 9-27-2016 ) 
Sec. 82-3. - Penalties. 
(a)  All penalties imposed by this article are part of the tax or assessment and are to be collected as such. The proceedings to collect the original tax, the tax constituted from penalties imposed, and the interest shall all be conducted in the same manner. Any provision of law for criminal prosecution shall not operate to relieve any taxpayer of any tax, penalty, or interest imposed by this article. 
(b)  In any instance in which any taxpayer fails to pay a tax or assessment within 90 days of the due date, he shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax due, together with interest as specified in this article. 
(c)  The board of commissioners may waive, in whole or in part, the collection of any amount due as a penalty under this article to the extent such body finds and determines the default giving rise to the penalty was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect or disregard of this article. 
(Code 1968, § 21-3) 
Sec. 82-4. - Executions on delinquent taxes and assessments. 
(a)  As soon as the last day for the payment of taxes and assessments has arrived, the finance officer shall notify in writing the taxpayer of the fact that the taxes have not been paid and that, unless paid within 30 days, an execution shall be issued. 
(b)  The finance officer shall issue executions for the nonpayment of taxes and assessments at any time after 30 days have elapsed since giving notice as provided in subsection (a) of this section. The execution shall identify the defendant in fi. fa. (taxpayer), the year for which delinquent taxes are being executed, and the amount thereof. Executions shall be directed to all and singular sheriffs and constables of the state. 
(c)  The finance officer shall cause all executions issued to be recorded on the general execution docket of the county where the property is located, in the case of real property; and, in the case of personal property, in the county of the taxpayer's residence if a resident of the state, otherwise in the county where any real or personal property of the taxpayer may be found. If the taxpayer is not a resident of the state and has no known real or personal property within the state, the execution shall be recorded in the county in which the act or activity giving rise to tax liability took place. 
(d)  All executions issued shall continue to bear interest and penalties at the rates established in this article for past-due taxes and assessments. 
(e)  The finance officer shall cause all executions issued to be placed in the hands of the city marshal for collection or levy and sale of property. The marshal shall exercise his best efforts to collect the full amount of taxes and assessments due, together with all interest, penalties, and any costs due thereon, from the defendant in fi. fa. In the event he is unable to do so, the marshal shall levy the execution on a sufficient amount of the defendant in fi. fa.'s property, whether real or personal, to satisfy the obligations due at a sale to be held and conducted in accordance with this article. 
(Code 1968, § 21-4) 
Sec. 82-5. - Levy of executions; sale of property. 
(a)  The chief of police is hereby designated as the marshal of the city and delegated the duties set forth in this article. The marshal shall be subject to being ruled for money in his hands arising from the public sale of any property pursuant to process issued by the municipality. After first paying the finance officer the amount due on the process under which the sale was made, the marshal shall pay any surplus to any lawful claimant holding an interest subordinate to the lien for taxes, else to the defendant in fi. fa. 
(b)  In all cases of levying on real property, within five days' written notice of the levy must be given personally, or delivered by certified mail, to the defendant in fi. fa. and to any tenants in possession. If the land is unoccupied, a copy of the notice of levy shall also be conspicuously posted on the land. In the case of personal property, the marshal shall enter the property on the execution and plainly describe the property levied on and the amount of the interest of the defendant in fi. fa. therein. 
(c)  Whenever any real property is levied upon for taxes or assessments, it shall be the marshal's duty before proceeding to advertise the property for sale to give 20 days' written notice of the levy to the record owner of the property and the holder of each security deed of record. The 20-day period shall begin to run from the time the notice is personally delivered or, when delivered by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, from the date of mailing. The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the owner of the land, the year or years for which the taxes were assessed, and a statement of the amount of the taxes due, together with accrued costs. The marshal shall keep a copy of the notice on which he shall enter the date the notice was delivered or mailed and how, where, and to whom the notice was delivered. The marshal shall file the copy with the finance officer. 
(d)  When a levy is made upon real or personal property, the property shall be advertised and sold by the marshal in the same manner as provided for executions and judicial sales; provided, however, in addition to such other notice as may be required by law, the defendant in fi. fa. shall be given at least ten days' written notice of such sale by registered or certified mail. The notice shall be addressed to the taxpayer at the last known address listed in the records of the county tax commissioner. In addition, if the United States has a claim or lien on the property subject to being sold and such lien was filed or recorded more than 30 days before the proposed sale, the marshal shall cause written notice of the sale to be given to the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate not less than 25 days before the sale. Notice may be given either by personal service or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. 
(e)  The marshal shall publish weekly for four weeks in the official legal organ of the county in which the sale will be conducted an advertisement of the date, place, and hours during which the sale will be conducted, together with a full and complete description of the property to be sold, making known the name of the owner of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state the property is being sold for collection of taxes due to the city and the year for which taxes have been executed. 
(f)  Sales of property under execution shall be made by the marshal in the board of commissioners chambers on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. eastern standard time or eastern daylight savings time, whichever is applicable, and at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash; provided, however, should the first Tuesday of the month fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sales shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. The purchaser shall look for himself as to the title and soundness of all property sold under tax executions and neither the marshal conducting the sale nor the city make any representations or warranty of title, condition, or fitness for a particular purpose, expressed or implied. 
(g)  The marshal shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash and, upon collection of the sales price, make a deed or bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who becomes the purchaser of any property sold at the sale, who fails or refuses to comply with the terms of sale when requested by the marshal to do so, shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money. It shall be the option of the marshal either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and then proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. A tax deed for real property, or bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered as evidence of a sale for taxes conducted pursuant to this article shall convey the title as effectually as if the sale were made by the person against whom the process was issued. Sales of personal property shall be final; real property sold by virtue of an execution issued for the collection of taxes or for any special assessments is subject to redemption rights of the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property at the time of levy and sale. Recitals in a deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the instrument. The marshal shall put the purchaser in possession of the property so sold; provided, however, the purchaser of real property is not entitled to be placed in possession until after the time for redemption has expired. 
(h)  Whenever no bids are forthcoming on property sold for taxes after the property has been offered a reasonable time, the marshal may either readvertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The marshal shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and exposed for sale has been abandoned due to lack of bids. 
(Code 1968, § 21-5) 
Sec. 82-6. - Bidding by city at tax sales; disposition of property acquired. 
(a)  If, during any sale of property for taxes and after the property has been offered a reasonable time, no one present at the sale bids an amount for the property being sold which is as much as the total of the taxes due (including any priority liens for taxes due the state, county, and school and other special tax districts of the state) plus the marshal's cost due on the sale, then the city manager, or his designee, may purchase the property for the city. If the city purchases property at a sale, the marshal shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city manager. The marshal shall put the city in possession of the property so sold. 
(b)  Property acquired by the city pursuant to a sale for taxes or assessments may be divested or alienated by the city only by public sale of the property to the highest bidder; however, when the city has not parted with title to the property, the city may quitclaim the property to the owner at the time of the tax sale, or to the owner's administrators, executors, heirs, or assigns, upon full payment of the redemption price provided in section 82-9. 
(c)  The right of redemption in real property purchased by the city at a tax sale shall be foreclosed in the manner set forth in section 82-9. 
(Code 1968, § 21-6) 
Sec. 82-7. - Accounting by marshal; final return or settlement. 
(a)  The marshal shall make a prompt accounting to the finance officer for all executions placed in his hands for collection or levy and sale. He shall pay over to the finance officer all amounts due the city for taxes and assessments, interest, penalties, and costs and shall file a final written return or settlement showing the amounts so paid, together with disposition of any excess proceeds derived from the sale. If there is any excess after paying taxes, costs, and all expenses of a sale, it shall be immediately paid to the person authorized to receive the excess. 
(b)  In any event, within 90 days from the date executions are placed in his hands, if the marshal finds an execution to be either uncollectible or not collectable in full, he shall so notify the finance officer in writing. It shall be the duty of the finance officer to cause cancellation of executions on the general execution docket of the county upon their final payment or collection. 
(Code 1968, § 21-7) 
Sec. 82-8. - Garnishments by city; reduction of executions to judgment. 
(a)  Whenever the marshal can find no property belonging to a defendant in fi. fa. on which to levy any tax execution in his hands, he shall make an entry to that effect on the execution. The finance officer, in the name of the city, may then petition any court of competent jurisdiction to issue a summons of garnishment against any person whom he believes to be indebted to the defendant in fi. fa. or who has property, money, or effects in his hands belonging to the defendant in fi. fa. The finance officer shall enter upon the execution the names of the persons garnished and the court and file number of the action where the garnishment is filed. All subsequent proceedings shall be the same as provided by law in other cases where judgments have been obtained or execution issued. 
(b)  When an execution for taxes remains unsatisfied and an entry of "nulla bona" has been duly entered by the marshal on the execution within the immediately preceding 30-day period and the finance officer has reason to believe the defendant in fi. fa. may have or may come into ownership of assets outside the state, the finance officer, in the name of the city, may petition the superior court of the county in this state in which the defendant in fi. fa. maintains a known residence, place of business, or agent to receive service to reduce the execution to judgment. If the defendant in fi. fa. does not maintain a known residence in this state, the action may be brought in the county where the tax obligation arose. This and all subsequent proceedings shall be brought in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-3-1 et seq. 
(Code 1968, § 21-8) 
Sec. 82-9. - Redemption rights of defendant in fi. fa.; vesting of title in grantee. 
(a)  Whenever real property is sold for taxes or any special assessment, the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property may redeem the property from the sale by the payment of the redemption price or the amount required for redemption as fixed by O.C.G.A. § 48-5-42, at any time within 12 months from the date of sale, and at any time after the sale until the right to redeem is foreclosed by the giving of the notice provided for in O.C.G.A. § 48-5-45, which sections by reference are incorporated herein as a part of this article. 
(b)  Where notice of foreclosure of the right to redeem real property sold at a tax sale has not been given as required in subsection (a) of this section, title shall ripen by prescription after a period of four years from the date of recording of the deed in the county where the property is situated, provided the defendant in fi. fa. was not laboring under any legal disability at the time of sale. Unless the tax deed indicates a lesser interest was levied upon and sold, a fee simple title to the property shall vest absolutely in the grantee in the deed or in the grantee's heirs or assigns. In the event the defendant in fi. fa. is laboring under any legal disability, the prescriptive term shall begin from the time the disabilities are removed or abated. 
(Code 1968, § 21-9) 
Sec. 82-10. - Costs. 
(a)  For issuing executions, the city shall receive only an amount equal to any filing fees charged by the clerk of superior court for recording and cancellation of the tax fi. fa. 
(b)  Once a levy is made or posted on the property of a defendant in fi. fa., in addition to all taxes, interest, penalties and costs heretofore accrued, the marshal shall collect a levy administration fee of five percent of the taxes due or $250.00, whichever is the lesser; however, no levy administration fee shall be less than $50.00. 
(c)  In addition to the foregoing fees, after levy but prior to the sale, the marshal shall collect his actual cost for advertising the sale, postage and service fees, and any attorney's fees incurred in examination of title to property, plus a commission for conducting the sale, not to exceed eight percent on sums of $50.00 or less, six percent on sums above $50.00 up to $550.00, and three on all sums exceeding $550.00. 
(d)  The costs provided in this section shall be cumulative and in addition to any statutory premiums allowed as a part of the redemption price. 
(Code 1968, § 21-10) 
Sec. 82-11. - Homestead exemption. 
(a)  For purposes of this section, "homestead" means the real property owned by and in the possession of the applicant on January 1 of the taxable year and upon which the applicant principally resides including, but not limited to, the land immediately surrounding the residence. It is the intent of this section that the term "homestead" be given consistent meaning with O.C.G.A. § 48-5-40 as applied for state, county and school tax purposes. 
(b)  The homestead of each resident of this city actually occupied by the owner as a residence and homestead on January 1 of the taxable year shall be exempted from all ad valorem taxation for city purposes, except taxes levied to pay interest on and to retire bonded indebtedness, for as long as the residence and homestead is actually occupied by the owner primarily as a residence and homestead. The exemption shall not exceed $10,000.00 of the market value of the homestead. Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, the market value of all homestead property in excess of $10,000.00 shall remain subject to taxation.

The innkeeper shall be liable to the city for the full amount received or collected as tax, whether collected appropriately or inappropriately; and for any amount of tax that should have been collected, but was not.

Any person who receives or collects the tax or any consideration represented to be the tax from another person holds the amount so collected in trust for the benefit of the city and is liable to the city for the full amount collected, plus penalty and interest. An individual who controls or supervises the collection of the tax from another person, or an individual who controls the accounting for or remittance of the tax, and who willfully fails to remit or cause to be remitted the tax is liable as a responsible individual for an amount equal to the tax not remitted or caused to be remitted, plus penalty and interest.

However, if the estimated tax liability for any monthly period shall exceed $2,500.00 for an innkeeper who, in the prior fiscal year remitted tax greater than $2,500.00 in any three consecutive months, such lodging provider shall file an estimated return and remit not less than 50 percent of the estimated tax liability for the monthly period by the 20th day of that same monthly period. The amount of tax so remitted shall be credited against the amount to be due with the regular return for the monthly period to be filed on the 20th day of the succeeding month. 
(3)  Extension of time of filing; authority; requirements; remittance; penalty and interest. The board of commissioners may, for good cause, extend the time for making returns for not longer than 30 days. No extension shall be granted more than once in any calendar quarter. An innkeeper granted an extension shall remit a tax equaling not less than 100 percent of the tax paid for the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year; such remittance to be made on or before the date the tax would otherwise come due without the grant of extension. No penalty or interest shall be charged during the first ten days of the extension period. Thereafter, interest shall be collected on the unpaid balance at an annual rate equal to the bank prime loan rate as posted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Statistical Release H.15, or any publication that may supercede it, plus 3 percent, to accrue monthly. Such annual interest rate shall be determined for each calendar year based on the first weekly posting of Statistical Release H.15 on or after January 1 of each calendar year. Interest shall begin to accrue from the date the tax is due until the date the tax is paid. Any period less than one month shall be considered to be one month. 
(4)  Collection fee allowed innkeepers.

The rate of the deduction shall be three percent of the amount due, but only if the amount due was not delinquent at the time of payment.

Delinquent amounts shall bear interest at an annual rate equal to the bank prime loan rate as posted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Statistical Release H.15, or any publication that may supercede it, plus 3 percent, to accrue monthly. Such annual interest rate shall be determined for each calendar year based on the first weekly posting of Statistical Release H.15 on or after January 1 of each calendar year. Interest shall begin to accrue from the date the tax is due until the date the tax is paid. Any period less than one month shall be considered to be one month. 
(c)  Acceptance of delinquent return and remittance without imposing penalty and interest; authority; requirements. If the failure to make any return or to pay the amount of tax by the due date results from providential cause shown to the satisfaction of the governing authority of the city by affidavit attached to the return, and remittance is made within ten days of the due date, such return may be accepted exclusive of penalty and interest.

ARTICLE VI. - COMMUNITY REDEVELOPMENT TAX INCENTIVE PROGRAM 

Sec. 82-141. - Purpose. 
The existence of real property which is maintained in a blighted condition increases the burden of the state and local government by increasing the need for government services, including but not limited to social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services. Rehabilitation of blighted property decreases this need for such government services. 
In furtherance of its objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the city, this board of commissioners, in exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations at Chapter 61, Urban Redevelopment, of Title 36 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, has designated those areas of the city where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread. 
In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia.

Sec. 86-131. - Purposes. 
This article is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the city, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of wireless support structures within the city so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the city as a proactive city in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications service.

(1)  Provide for the appropriate location and development of wireless facilities in the city; 
(2)  Protect the city's built and natural environment by promoting compatible design standards for wireless facilities; 
(3)  Minimize adverse visual impacts of wireless facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
(4)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennae failure through engineering and careful siting of wireless support structures and antennas;

(6)  Maximize and encourage use of alternative wireless support structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and 
(7)  Encourage and promote the location of new wireless facilities in areas which are not zoned for residential use.

( Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 12-8-2015 ) 
Sec. 86-134. - Initial siting of wireless support structures. 
(a)  Wireless support structures shall be allowed as a use by right in the central business district (CBD), planned commercial district (PCD), planned industrial district (PID) and institutional district (INST), as shown on the official zoning map of the city. In all other zoning districts, wireless support structures shall be allowed by special use permit following procedures of the Unified Development Code of Griffin, Georgia. No wireless support structure shall be sited at any location where it causes obstruction or interference with navigable air space. 
(b)  Wireless support structures, other than monopole towers, designed and intended to accommodate at least one user are permitted up to a height of 100 feet following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building official. Wireless support structures, other than monopole towers, designed and intended to accommodate at least two users are permitted up to a height of 120 feet following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building official. Wireless support structures designed and intended to accommodate at least three users are permitted up to a height of 140 feet following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building official. A height variance may be sought following procedures of the Unified Development Code of Griffin, Georgia. No variance shall be granted for a wireless support structure of a height greater than 160 feet. The standard for granting a height variance for a wireless support structure, other than monopole towers, shall be the willingness of the owner to provide space on the structure for future collocation. 
(c)  Monopoles are permitted up to a height of 80 feet to accommodate single users. Monopoles are permitted up to a height of 100 feet if designed and intended to accommodate at least two users. A height variance may be sought following procedures of the Unified Development Code of Griffin, Georgia. No variance shall be granted for a monopole of a height greater than 120 feet. The standard for granting a height variance for a monopole tower shall be the willingness of the owner to provide space on the structure for future collocation. 
(d)  Larger satellite dishes of greater than one meter in diameter, but less than two meters in diameter, shall not be located within the downtown commercial historic district of the city, as listed on the National Register of Historical Places, or within the front yard setback or roof of a single-family residence, unless a building permit is issued by the zoning administrator following design review in which the applicant demonstrates he cannot receive acceptable signals in preferred locations. 
(e)  It is the intent of the city, in exercising its police power under this article, to streamline its procedures for initial siting of wireless facilities, not to unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services nor prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services. In considering an application for the initial siting of a wireless support structure, the city, its staff and governing body, shall not seek or require information about, evaluate, or consider the technical, business, or service characteristics of such proposed wireless facilities, the provider(s), nor the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions. 
(f)  All decisions as to the initial siting of wireless support structures shall be made within 150 calendar days of the initial filing of an application, as extended only by the tolling of such period if the application has been returned to the applicant, within 30 days from the date of initial filing, as incomplete in accordance with FCC regulations issued under 47 U.S.C. § 331(c)(7). Any decision to deny the application must be in writing, supported by substantial evidence, and served upon the applicant prior to expiration of said period (as calculated in the manner provided in said regulations); failure to timely notify the applicant of a denial, in writing, shall be deemed to be an approval of the application, as filed. Notice of incompleteness given under this section must specify the code provision or other requirement that is missing; following a resubmission by the applicant, any further notice of incompleteness shall be given within ten days and reference specifically only missing items noticed in the first notice of incompleteness. 
( Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 12-8-2015 ) 
Sec. 86-135. - Preferred and disfavored location sites. 
(a)  Preferred location sites. Preferred location sites are prioritized from highest to lowest as follows: 
(1)  Collocation sites: Any existing wireless support structure currently being used for transmitting or receiving electromagnetic radio signals used in the provision of all types of wireless communications services shall be the highest preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site; provided, however, that colocations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this article and collocation sites shall not become an antenna farm or otherwise be deemed by the building official or the governing authority to be visually obtrusive. 
(2)  Publicly owned structures: Publicly owned structures are the next highest preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and, due to their institutional or infrastructure uses, are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, wireless support structures should be less noticeable when placed on publicly owned structures than when placed on industrial or commercial structures. Publicly owned structures include, but are not limited to, facilities such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flag poles, schools, hospitals, clock or bell towers, light poles and churches. 
(3)  Industrial and commercial structures: Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, or service stations shall be preferred locations particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roofline can and will be removed as part of the installation of the wireless support structure. 
(4)  Mixed use buildings in high-density districts: Mixed use buildings (housing above commercial or other nonresidential space) are also preferred location sites. 
(b)  Disfavored location sites. Any single-family residential district or site adjoining a single-family residence, duplex, or multifamily housing complex shall be a disfavored site for the location of wireless facilities; provided, however, larger satellite dishes may be sited in rear or side yard setbacks as a matter of right. 
( Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 12-8-2015 ) 
Sec. 86-136. - Requirements for all wireless support structures. 
(a)  General requirements for all wireless support structures. The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the design and construction of all wireless support structures governed by this article. 
(1)  Building codes and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of wireless support structures, the owner shall ensure that proposed facilities are designed, constructed, and maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building codes and any applicable standards for such wireless support structures, as amended from time to time. Compliance shall be shown by the seal and signature of a registered engineer licensed in the State of Georgia on the design plans. Owners of wireless facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every year to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified, independent engineer licensed to practice in this state. The results of such inspection shall be provided, in writing, to the building official. 
(2)  Regulatory compliance. 
a.  All wireless support structures must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Communication Commission and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this article shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations. 
b.  Owners of wireless support structures shall provide documentation to the building official, upon written request, showing that each wireless facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance may be requested every 12 months. 
c.  It shall be the duty of every owner of a wireless support structure existing in the city as of February 22, 2012, or constructed thereafter, to provide the building official with an "as-built" scaled diagram showing the dimensions of every wireless support structure, the equipment compound in which located, together with the number of equipment cabinets within the compound. Such drawing shall show the height of the wireless support structure, the width of the structure at each point where antenna are proposed to be affixed, the height at which each antenna is affixed to the structure, and the distance the antennae projects above or horizontally from the structure. 
(3)  Security. All wireless support structures shall be fenced and equipped with an appropriate security system, including, if applicable, an anticlimbing device or other similar protective device, to prevent unauthorized access to the structure. 
(4)  Lighting. No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the Federal Communication Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction or unless necessary for air traffic safety. If lighting is required or necessary, the building official may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 
(5)  Advertising. No advertising is permitted on wireless facilities. However, a whip antenna may be allowed on any legally permitted permanent billboard or outdoor advertising sign as long as the other requirements of this article are met. 
(6)  Visual impact. 
a.  Wireless facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the Federal Aviation Administration or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
b.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background. 
c.  Where feasible, wireless facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging. 
d.  Wireless facilities should not be placed in a direct line of sight within historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body, local historic preservation commission, or by any state or federal agency. 
e.  Any equipment cabinet that supports wireless facilities must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment compounds or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The compound or cabinet must be regularly maintained. 
(7)  Landscaping. 
a.  Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the wireless facility from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property. 
b.  Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
c.  The building official may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms, or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the zoning administrator. 
(8)  Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a wireless facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector or local street. 
(9)  Principal, accessory and joint uses. 
a.  Accessory structures used in direct support of a wireless facility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a wireless facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the wireless facility. 
b.  Wireless facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. 
(10)  Lot size and setbacks. 
a.  The following setback requirements shall apply to wireless facilities, provided, however, that the building official may reduce the standard setback requirements of this section if the goals of this article would be better served thereby: 
1.  Wireless support structures must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site residential structure. 
2.  Towers, guy wires and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
3.  Wireless facilities must be set back from any property line a sufficient distance to protect adjoining property from the potential impact of wireless facility failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in this article. 
b.  For antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ratio (example: ten-foot-high antenna and supporting structure requires ten-foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact. 
(b)  Additional requirements for towers. 
(1)  Site location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zoning district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical. Concealment elements, or "stealth-design", may be a reasonable condition of permit approval. 
(2)  Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area. 
(3)  At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
(4)  Towers shall not be located any closer than 1,500 feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or visually preferable. 
(5)  When a tower is adjacent to a residential use, it must be set back from the nearest residence a distance at least equal to its total height. 
(6)  In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard or side yard in a residential district. 
(7)  Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body, a local historic preservation commission, or any state or federal agency, or where they will create visual clutter. 
(8)  Towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device or other similar protective device designed to prevent tower access. 
(9)  Placement of more than one tower on a lot may be permitted, provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails. 
(10)  Wireless facilities shall meet all requirements of the city's stormwater regulations, including post-construction maintenance and inspection requirements. 
( Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 12-8-2015 ) 
Sec. 86-137. - Application procedures. 
(a)  General application requirements for all building and special use permits. Application for a building permit or special use permit for any wireless facility shall be made to the building official by the person, company, or organization that will own and operate the wireless facility. An application will not be considered until it is complete. The following information shall be submitted when applying for any building permit, special use permit, or variance included in this article and must be submitted for an application to be considered complete: 
(1)  Basic information. 
a.  Site plan or plans to scale specifying the location of wireless facilities, base station and/or other accessory uses, access, parking, fences, landscaped areas, drainage, and adjacent land uses.

b.  Evidence of legal ownership or interest, such as a deed to the property or a lease between the legal owner(s) and applicant for the building permit. 
c.  Landscape plan to scale indicating size, spacing and type of plantings required in subsection 86-136(a)(7). 
d.  A full description of the immediate area surrounding the proposed wireless facility, including any adjacent residential structures and districts, structures and sites of historic significance, streetscapes or scenic view corridors. 
e.  Report from a qualified professional engineer licensed in this state, documenting the following: 
1.  Height of the proposed wireless facility, width at base, and design, including any pertinent design factors governing the proposed facility; 
2.  Total anticipated capacity of the telecommunications facility, including number and types of antenna which can be accommodated; 
3.  Evidence of structural integrity of the tower structure; and 
4.  Structural failure characteristics of the wireless support structure and demonstration that site and setbacks are of adequate size to contain debris. 
f.  The identity of a community liaison officer appointed by the applicant to resolve issues of concern to neighbors and residents relating to the construction and operation of the facility. Include name, address, telephone number, facsimile number and email address, if applicable. 
g.  Identification of the geographic service area for the subject installation, including a map showing the proposed site and the nearest wireless facilities to the proposed site. Describe the distance between the proposed wireless facility site and existing sites. 
h.  Designation of which location preference, identified in section 86-134, the proposed facility is meeting. If the proposed location is not a preferred location one through four or is a disfavored site, describe: (i) what collocation site, publicly owned facility, or other preferred location site(s) are located within the geographic service area; (ii) what good faith efforts and measures were taken to secure each of these preferred location sites; (iii) why each such site was not feasible and/or why such efforts were unsuccessful; and (iv) why the proposed site is essential to meet service demands for the geographic service area. 
(2)  Additional information requirements for towers. 
a.  If the proposed site is zoned for residential use, applicants must justify why any alternate sites in commercial or industrial zones have not been proposed. The building official will not consider justifications that appeal only to undue expense and/or to undue difficulties in entering into a lease agreement. The building official shall not deny a building permit if the applicant refuses to site its wireless facility on public property; otherwise, it shall be ground for denial if collocation space on an existing tower is available and the applicant refuses to collocate. 
b.  The applicant must provide a utilities inventory showing the locations of all water, sewage, drainage, gas and power lines impacting the proposed tower site. 
(3)  Applicant required to provide information . The applicant must provide any other information which may be requested by the building official to fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact of a proposed wireless facility. 
(b)  Expedited review for building permits only. When a wireless facility will be a use of right pursuant to section 86-134 and requires only a building permit and design review before it may be erected, the building official will expedite review of the application and render a decision on the application within 30 days after receipt of a complete application. 
(c)  Special use permits. 
(1)  A request for a special use permit shall be initiated by application to the zoning administrator and handled in accordance with the special use permit procedures of Section 406 of the Unified Development Code of Griffin, Georgia. The governing body may issue a special use permit under this section, provided it shall have determined that all of the requirements of section 86-136 have been satisfied and, further, that the benefits of and need for the proposed tower are greater than any possible depreciating effects and damage to the neighboring properties. 
(2)  In granting a special use permit, the governing body may impose additional reasonable conditions to the extent determined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding properties. 
( Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 12-8-2015 ) 
Sec. 86-138. - Appeals. 
Any decision by the building official denying a request to site or construct a wireless facility shall be in writing and specifically stating the reason(s) for denial. Appeals from any decision of the building official under this Article may be taken by any person aggrieved by the decision. Such appeal shall be made, in writing, to the governing body and filed within ten days of a written denial. The governing body shall hear the appeal in an administrative hearing at its next regular meeting or at a time mutually agreed for a hearing by the parties. Any decision by the governing body denying or approving with conditions a request to site or construct a wireless facility shall be final; served upon the appellant in writing and supported by substantial evidence in a written record, which shall be provided the appellant contemporaneously with the letter of denial. 
Applicants who are aggrieved by a final decision of the board of commissioners may, within 30 days of the date of written notice of denial, elect to: (a) seek judicial review in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Newnan Division, or (b) make application for writ of certiorari to the Superior Court of Spalding County, Georgia. 
( Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 12-8-2015 ) 
Sec. 86-139. - Modification—Colocation, removal or replacement of antennae. 
(a)  The owner of all existing wireless facilities, including future towers permitted under this article, shall allow other future personal wireless service companies, including public and quasi-public agencies, using functionally equivalent personal wireless technology to collocate antennas, equipment and facilities on an existing telecommunications facility unless specific technical constraints prohibit such collocation. Personal wireless carriers shall provide a mechanism for the construction and maintenance of shared facilities and infrastructure and shall provide for equitable sharing of cost in accordance with industry standards. 
(b)  Review of applications to modify eligible support structures. All modifications (colocation of new transmission equipment; removal of transmission equipment; or replacement of transmission equipment) of an eligible support structure shall be made by written application to the building official. Section 6409 of the Spectrum Act, codified at 47 U.S.C. § 1455, requires the city to approve any eligible facilities request for a modification of an existing tower or base station that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station. Where the application and supporting documentation submitted by the applicant demonstrates the modification has been designed and will be constructed to observe all building and safety codes, maintain any concealment element or "stealth" condition, and extends less than 10' vertically and 6' horizontally, the application shall be approved and permit issued; provided, however, the owner of the facility shall submit modified "as-built" plans and drawings to the building inspector reflecting the modification(s) made. 
(c)  All other applications for modifications which substantially change the physical dimensions of an existing tower or base station shall follow the format of section 86-137 and be supported by documentation or information reasonably demonstrating the modification will meet the criteria of this article. Within 60 days of the date on which an applicant submits an application seeking approval of a substantial modification, the city shall approve, deny, or approve with reasonable conditions the application, in writing. If denied, the letter of denial shall contain a statement of the specific grounds for denial. The 60-day period begins to run on the date the application is filed with the building official and may be tolled only if the city, within 30 days of receipt of the application, notifies the applicant, in writing, that the application is not complete, clearly and specifically delineating all missing documents or information (such delineated documents or information limited to the requirements of this section). 
(d)  In the event the city fails to approve or deny a request for substantial modification within the timeframe for review (accounting for any tolling), the request shall be deemed granted; provided, however, the request shall not become effective until the applicant notifies the city's building official, in writing, served upon the building official by either personal service, or certified mail (return receipt requested) that the review period (accounting for any tolling) has expired and that the application has been deemed granted. 
(e)  If a building permit is not forthcoming from the city, the applicant may bring a claim related to 47 U.S.C. § 1455 in any federal district court of competent jurisdiction. 
( Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 12-8-2015 ) 
Sec. 86-140. - Nuisances. 
Wireless facilities, including, without limitation, power source, ventilation and cooling, shall be operated at all times so as not to cause unreasonable noise or the generation of heat that adversely affects a building's occupants and shall be maintained or operated in such a manner as to not become a nuisance.

Sec. 86-141. - Maintenance of antennas and towers. 
All wireless facilities shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such facilities. If upon inspection by the building official any such telecommunications facility is determined not to comply with the code standards or to constitute a danger to persons or property, then, upon notice being provided to the owner of the facility and the owner of the property, if such owner is different, such owners shall have 30 days to bring such facility into compliance. In the event such wireless facility is not brought into compliance within 30 days, the city may provide notice to the owners requiring the wireless facility to be removed. In the event such wireless facility is not removed within 30 days of receipt of such notice, the city may remove such facility and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that wireless facilities not in compliance with the code standards or which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compliance or removed. The city may seek to have the wireless facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's future intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. 
( Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 12-8-2015 ) 
Sec. 86-142. - Abandoned towers. 
(a)  Any wireless facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make future use of it or any part of it. The owner of a wireless facility and the owner of the property where the facility is located shall be under a duty to remove the abandoned wireless facility. If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the city notifying the owner of such abandonment, the city may remove such tower and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that abandoned wireless facilities are removed. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may seek to have the wireless facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's future intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. 
(b)  If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this article as if such tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna. 
( Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 12-8-2015 ) 
Sec. 86-143. - Preexisting towers/nonconforming uses. 
(a)  All wireless facilities operative on November 15, 1997, shall be allowed to continue their present usage as a nonconforming use and shall be treated as a nonconforming use in accordance with this article. Routine maintenance, including replacement with a new tower or antenna of like construction and height, shall be permitted on such existing telecommunications facilities. New construction other than routine maintenance shall comply with the requirements of this article. 
(b)  A telecommunications facility that has received city approval as of November 15, 1997, in the form of either a building permit or special use permit, but has not yet been constructed or placed in operation shall be considered an existing wireless facility so long as such approval is current and not expired. 
(c)  Placement of an antenna on a nonconforming structure shall not be considered an expansion of the nonconforming structure. 
( Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 12-8-2015 ) 
Sec. 86-144. - Penalty for violation of article. 
(a)  Any person who attempts to erect or erects a wireless facility covered by this article without having first obtained the necessary building permit, special use permit, or variance in the manner provided in this article shall be deemed in violation of this article. Any responsible party or other persons convicted in the municipal court of the city of violating any provision of this article shall be guilty of violating a duly adopted ordinance of the city and shall be punished as provided in section 1-12. 
(b)  If any structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or maintained in violation of this article or without obtaining the required permits, or if any building, structure or land is used in violation of this article, the building official, in addition to any other remedies, may institute proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance or use or to correct or abate such violations. Each and every day such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance or use continues may be deemed a separate offense. 
( Ord. No. 15-17, § 1, 12-8-2015 ) 
Sec. 86-145. - Coordination with federal law. 
Whenever the governing authority finds that the application of this article would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services or prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, a waiver of the offending provisions of this article shall be granted. Whenever the provisions of this article are found in conflict with applicable federal law, the provisions of the federal law shall prevail.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 06-13, § 1, adopted Nov. 28, 2006, added art. VIII, consisting of §§ 90-150—90-153, to the Code. Inasmuch as art. VIII and §§ 90-150—90-153 already existed, said provisions have been redesignated to read as set out herein at the editor's discretion. 

Sec. 90-175. - Definitions. 
For purposes of this article, the term "right-of-way" shall mean that real property, titled in the city in fee simple or held in perpetual easement for street-related purposes, lying between the edge of street paving (or if the affected street is unpaved, from the outer edge of the surface intended for motor-vehicle travel) and the adjoining property boundary with private property. The term shall encompass all areas adjoining the public street or roadway wherein utilities and sidewalks are located and maintained. 
(Ord. No. 06-13, § 1, 11-28-2006) 
Sec. 90-176. - Parking on rights-of-way prohibited; exceptions. 
No motor vehicles, trailers or related equipment (pulled or conveyed by a separate motor vehicle) shall stop, stand or park upon any unimproved right-of-way within the city, except for those areas clearly designated for parking on a paved driveway or parking pad. The public works department shall cause to be prepared an inventory of existing areas, within rights-of-way, designated for parking of motor vehicles, and shall be responsible for permitting, upon application on forms provided by the city, any future areas where parking is sought to be designated. In considering applications for parking permits on the rights-of-way, the public works director shall consider the use of rights-of-way for utilities (existing or future uses) and reasonable utilities protection requirements; landscaping and protection of street trees and vegetation; and the sufficiency and suitability of adjoining private property to meet the applicant's parking needs. Only owners in fee simple of adjoining private property may apply for permits to park on the right-of-way. It is the intent of the board of commissioners that future permits for parking on rights-of-way not be granted unless the applicant demonstrates unreasonable hardship and that no other reasonable alternative exists. Denial of permits may be appealed to the city manager, whose decision shall be final. It shall be the responsibility of the public works department to post signage at reasonable intervals throughout the city warning that parking on rights-of-way is prohibited, except where clearly designated. This section shall not impair any motor-vehicle operator's ability to park on streets, except where parking is posted as prohibited or restricted. Wheel stops, curbs, or other barriers shall be erected, as appropriate, to protect utilities and trees from rights-of-way encroachment. 
(Ord. No. 06-13, § 1, 11-28-2006) 
Sec. 90-177. - Exceptions. 
Other than those areas designated for parking on the rights-of-way, this section shall not be enforced against owners or operators of motor vehicles and trailers standing or parked on the rights-of-way when mechanically disabled, provided prompt notice is given to the police department of the condition and location of such vehicle or equipment. Exception is also made for the standing or parking of motor vehicles and trailers on rights-of-way when necessary to perform work related to construction or maintenance of improvements, either in, under or above the right-of-way or on adjoining private property, provided notice is given the city's public works department prior to commencement of said work. Overnight parking of motor vehicles and equipment while work is in progress and cannot reasonably be completed in one business day shall require a permit from the public works department, which shall be conspicuously affixed to the vehicle or equipment. 
(Ord. No. 06-13, § 1, 11-28-2006) 
Sec. 90-178. - Citation; sanction. 
Any person that operates a motor vehicle, trailer or related equipment, except in an emergency situation or while performing work at a location within the right-of-way, found to be stopped, standing or parked in violation of this article shall be issued a warning for the first offense; all subsequent offenses shall be deemed a violation of the above section and punished in the manner provided in section 1-12.

( Ord. No. 16-02, § 1(Att.), 1-26-2016 ) 
Sec. 94-39. - Technical specifications for sewer connections. 
(a)  The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building sewer and service lateral, and the methods to be used in construction shall conform to the requirements of the statewide minimum construction codes, applicable regulations of the city sewer department, and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Water Pollution Control Federation (WPCF) Manual of Practice No. 9. All connections to the public sewer system shall be approved in writing by the director, based upon permit application and payment of permit and inspection fees as specified, from time to time, by resolution of the board of commissioners. No work shall be covered until inspected by the director and the connection approved. 
(b)  Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be at an elevation below the lowest floor of the building or structure and at least three feet above the point of sewer connection. In all buildings in which the building sewer it too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sewage shall be lifted by a means approved, in writing, by the director. It shall be the responsibility of the property owner to maintain in proper working condition any lift pumps and/or tanks for such connection. 
(c)  The service lateral and all connections between the building sewer and the public sewer shall be gastight and watertight, as verified by proper testing and inspection. It shall be the duty of the property owner to maintain the service lateral in proper working condition. If any service lateral permits the entrance of infiltration or inflow, the director may require the owner to repair or replace the service lateral; charge the owner a sewer use rate surcharge that reflects the additional cost of treating infiltration and inflow; or require the owner to disconnect the building from the public sewer system. 
(d)  Roof downspouts, foundation drains, yard drains or other sources of surface runoff shall not be connected to the building sewer or service lateral for entry into the public sewer. 
(e)  In all new construction, a backwater valve shall be installed to prevent sewage from backing into the building or structure. In all other existing structures, the director may, in his sole discretion, require installation of a backwater valve by written directive to the property owner to prevent reoccurrence of a sewer backup. The city does not accept legal responsibility for damages to real or personal property caused by sewer backups where backwater valves are required or have been directed to be installed. It shall be the duty of the property owner to maintain backwater valves in proper working condition. 
( Ord. No. 16-02, § 1(Att.), 1-26-2016 )

DIVISION 2. - NONDOMESTIC (INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL, INSTITUTIONAL) USE OF PUBLIC WASTEWATER FACILITIES 

Sec. 94-56. - Prohibited discharges. 
(a)  General prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. 
(b)  Specific prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater: 
(1)  Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140°F (60°C) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21; 
(2)  Wastewater having a pH less than 5.5 or more than 11.0, or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment; 
(3)  Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction of the flow in the sewer system or POTW resulting in interference; 
(4)  Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with the POTW; 
(5)  Wastewater having a temperature greater than104°F (40°C), or which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, 
(6)  Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through; 
(7)  Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems; 
(8)  Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the director in accordance with section 94-68 of this article; 
(9)  Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair; 
(10)  Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's effluent, thereby violating the city's NPDES permit; 
(11)  Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations; 
(12)  Storm water, surface water, ground water, artesian well water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage, condensate, deionized water, noncontact cooling water, and unpolluted wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the director;

(14)  Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the director in a wastewater discharge permit; 
(15)  Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources, the treatment plant's effluent to fail a toxicity test; 
(16)  Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances which may cause excessive foaming in the POTW; 
(17)  Wastewater containing more than 100 mg/L of oil and grease consisting of any of the following; fats, oils, or greases of animal or vegetable origin, and/or wax, whether emulsified or not; petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, and/or products of mineral oil origin, and/or containing any substance(s) which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 0°C (32°F) and 65°C (150°F). 
(18)  Wastewater causing two readings on an explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge into the POTW, or at any point in the POTW, of more than five percent or any single reading over ten percent of the lower explosive limit of the meter. 
(19)  The following pollutant limits are established to protect against process interference, stream standards violation, or sludge contamination. Discharges by users of the collection and treatment system are limited such that the concentrations of specific pollutants measured at the point of discharge into the collection system do not exceed concentrations specified below: 
LOCAL LIMITS 
No user shall discharge wastewater which exceeds the following daily maximum shown limits (all numbers shown in mg/L) User may also be required to provide a mass loading rate to define each pollutant in pounds/day. Permit may be written to limit pollutant in pounds/day as well as maximum concentration limits: 

 
Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW. 
The city reserves the right to enter into special agreements with industrial users setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement. The industrial user may, however, request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. The industrial user may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from EPA. Such a request will be approved only if the industrial user can prove that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when establishing that pretreatment standard. An industrial user requesting a fundamentally different factor variance must comply with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13. 
( Ord. No. 16-02, § 1(Att.), 1-26-2016 ) 
Sec. 94-57. - Federal and state requirements; preemption. 
(a)  Federal pretreatment standards. 
(1)  The federal government has adopted regulations governing wastewater discharges from industries into POTWs. These federal regulations are generally referred to as the federal pretreatment standards, as set forth in 40 CFR Part 403, or the federal categorical pretreatment standards, as set forth in 40 CFR Parts 405—471. Any portion of these federal standards which are more strict than the regulations provided in this Code shall control over the provisions herein, and such regulations will be enforced by the city. 
(2)  It is the affirmative obligation of all industrial users regulated by the federal pretreatment standards, inclusive of the federal categorical pretreatment standards, to comply with the federal standards whether or not the industry has received notification from the city or any other jurisdiction of the existence and nature of the federal standards. 
(3)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
(4)  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the director shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
(5)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(6)  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
(b)  State regulations. Any regulations promulgated by the State of Georgia relative to the construction or use of wastewater facilities which are more strict than the regulations provided in this Code shall control over the provisions herein, and such regulations shall be enforced by the city. 
(c)  Modifications to federal and state pretreatment standards. 
(1)  From time to time the federal and state environmental regulatory agencies may alter existing pretreatment standards or promulgate new standards. None of the provisions contained in this Code shall prevent the timely implementation of new or altered pretreatment standards by the industries to whom the new or altered standards apply. Where new or altered standards are more strict than the standards presently being imposed by the city, the city may, without prejudice, immediately revise any industrial wastewater discharge permits to reflect the new or altered standards. If the industrial user is unable to immediately conform to the new or altered standards, a reasonable schedule for compliance shall be provided by the director. 
(2)  Where the city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in 95 percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in section 403.7(c)(2) of 40 CFR Part 403 promulgated pursuant to the Clean Water Act, as amended. The city may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the Federal Pretreatment Standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR Part 403, Section 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the Georgia Environmental Protection Division is obtained. 
( Ord. No. 16-02, § 1(Att.), 1-26-2016 )

Sec. 94-59. - Sampling and testing procedures. 
(a)  Sampling procedures. 
(1)  Except as indicated in subsection (a)(2), below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, hexavalent chromium, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(b)  Testing procedures. 
(1)  All wastewater monitoring samples required by the city shall be tested by an independent laboratory for the parameters required, with the results submitted to the city on the original laboratory report sheets. The requirement for utilization of an independent laboratory may be waived by the city when the required tests are performed by the city or other approved agency or when duplicate ("split") samples are provided to the city and the city's testing results of such duplicate samples show a reasonably good correlation with the user's in-house testing results. 
(2)  All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, or in accordance with any applicable EPA testing procedure of general acceptance in the chemical testing industry, provided, however, that all such analyses shall be determined in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 136, which requirements shall prevail in the event of conflict. 
(3)  The cost(s) incurred for testing shall be the responsibility of the customer. 
( Ord. No. 16-02, § 1(Att.), 1-26-2016 ) 
Sec. 94-60. - Significant industrial users. 
General. All significant industrial users (see definition of significant industrial user in section 94-32) that discharge wastewater effluent into the city wastewater system shall comply with the following: 
(a)  Sampling manhole. In order to provide for accurate sampling and measurement of industrial wastes, each significant industrial user shall provide and maintain, on each of its industrial waste outlet sewers, a large manhole or sampling chamber to be located outside the plant. If inside the plant fence, there shall be a gate near the sampling manhole with a key furnished to the city. There shall be ample room provided in each sampling manhole to enable convenient inspection and sampling by the city, or its agent. In certain sampling manholes where noxious fumes may accumulate, the city may require a fume exhaust system to protect the life and health of the city employees who are required to enter the sampling manhole. The fume exhaust system should extract the fumes from the bottom of the manhole and provide not less than one air change per minute. 
(b)  Discharge permit required. It shall be unlawful for any significant industrial user, as determined under this article, to discharge wastewater into the city wastewater system without a city issued discharge permit.

For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 94-58 of this article. 
(e)  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the director of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 60 days before the change. 
(1)  The director may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 94-61 of this article. 
(2)  The director may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 94-61 of this ordinance or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 94-61 of this ordinance in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(3)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
(f)  Reports of potential problem, including slug loading. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the industrial pretreatment coordinator of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(2)  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the director, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this ordinance. 
(3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (f)(1), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(g)  Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the director as the director may require, in writing. 
(h)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the director within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the city monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the city samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(i)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(1)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 94-62(e) of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections (a), (c) and (d) of this section.

Sec. 94-69. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Definitions. For the purposes of this section: 
(1)  Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(2)  Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  Allowable bypass. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  Notices. 
(1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the director, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the pretreatment coordinator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d)  Bypass is prohibited; enforcement; exception. Bypass is prohibited, and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
(1)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(2)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
(3)  The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
(e)  Approval. The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d) of this section.

(5)  Violation of the pretreatment standards in division 2 of this article. 
(b)  Such user shall be notified, in writing, of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered a reasonable opportunity to show cause before the director why the proposed action should not be taken. The decision of the director, after notice and opportunity for hearing, shall be deemed a final action by the city. Exercise of this option by the director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. Aggrieved users may seek judicial review by petitioning the Superior Court of the county for writ of certiorari. 
( Ord. No. 16-02, § 1(Att.), 1-26-2016 ) 
Sec. 94-96. - Emergency suspensions. 
(a)  The director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after oral notice to the user, whenever, in the director's sole discretion, such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 94-95 are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of a termination hearing under section 94-95. 
(b)  Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

In the case of a monthly or other longterm average discharge limit, civil penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation, but shall not exceed $25,000.00 cumulatively. The director shall cause a complaint and summons to be served upon the violator ordering the violator to appear before the Municipal Court to show cause why such penalty shall not be imposed. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provision in O.C.G.A. § 36-35-6, any other provision of law, or municipal charter to the contrary, the Municipal Court shall have civil jurisdiction in cases of violations committed within the municipal limits of the city and shall be authorized to impose the civil penalties above stated. Violations by customers of the city sewer system outside the municipal limits of the city shall be brought in the appropriate county court of civil jurisdiction. Timely written notice of any enforcement action taken pursuant to this section shall be given the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources; provided, however, failure to give such notice shall not be a defense to the underlying violation. 
(b)  In addition to any monetary fine imposed, the director may seek restitution of reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city. 
(c)  In determining the amount of penalty to be imposed, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions voluntarily undertaken by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
(d)  In lieu of the provisions of subsections (a) through (c) of this section, the director may, in his sole discretion, elect to file a complaint for civil liability in the state court of the county, in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 12-5-51. In those cases where the violator has been cited to Municipal Court and refuses to waive the right to trial by jury, the Municipal Court may bind the case over to the state court under this section. 
(e)  Conviction in the Municipal Court under this section shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
( Ord. No. 16-02, § 1(Att.), 1-26-2016 ) 
Sec. 94-98. - Criminal prosecution. 
(a)  A user who willfully or knowingly violates any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or consent order issued under this article, or any order of the Municipal Court issued under section 94-97, shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor. The director shall apply for a state warrant for violation of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-53(a), returnable to the State Court of the county. 
(b)  The director shall seek the issuance of state warrants for any person violating any of the provisions set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-5-53(b)—(d), returnable to the appropriate state courts of criminal jurisdiction. 
( Ord. No. 16-02, § 1(Att.), 1-26-2016 ) 
Sec. 94-99. - Remedies nonexclusive. 
The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the city's enforcement response plan. However, the director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
( Ord. No. 16-02, § 1(Att.), 1-26-2016 ) 
Sec. 94-100. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
The director shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements as defined in section 94-91. 
( Ord. No. 16-02, § 1(Att.), 1-26-2016 ) 
Sec. 94-101. - Notification delivery of enforcement actions. 
Written notice personally delivered or placed in the U.S. mail by certified mail to the person's last known address, as shown in city utility billing records, shall be deemed sufficient notice for all enforcement actions in this article. Such notice may be personally served on the user or any authorized representative of the user. With respect to article violations regarding nonpayment of amounts due under this article, only notice mailed to the person's last known address, by regular U.S. mail, of the amount owed and the date upon which payment is due shall be required.

Sec. 94-131. - Determination of public need for sewer; basis for assessment of property owners. 
(a)  The board of commissioners may determine by resolution whether areas exist within the municipal boundary that are not currently accessible to the sewer system and whether public health and sanitation concerns exist that would justify the extension of the sewer system into these areas. The resolution shall identify the boundary of the proposed areas to be served and identify all properties within the proposed area that will benefit from access to sewer. The board of commissioners shall determine whether a special benefit will accrue to those property owners benefitting from access to sewer apart from that benefit derived by taxpayers of the city in general. 
(b)  In all cases where a special benefit is deemed to accrue, the board of commissioners shall determine what portion, if any, the city will pay of the total cost of installing and laying the sewer line and how the remaining cost will be fairly and equitably apportioned among the property owners who shall benefit from access to sewer. The proposed method of assessment against the property owners shall be set forth in the resolution, together with a good faith estimate of the proposed assessment against each property owner. The resolution shall specify the date, place and time for holding a public hearing before the board of commissioners at which the merits of the project and any objections thereto may be considered. 
(c)  The city manager shall cause notice to be given to every property owner identified in the resolution as potentially benefitting from access to the proposed sewer. Such notice shall be in writing and mailed to the property owners by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the address shown on the city tax digest for the mailing of tax notices. Notices shall be mailed at least 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing and shall attach a copy of the resolution. The notice shall specify the date, time and location of the hearing and advise property owners of their right to be heard. 
(d)  Notice shall also be published by the city manager once a week for two weeks in a newspaper having a general circulation in the city. The time fixed for the hearing shall be not less than five nor more than ten days from the date of the last publication of the notice. 
(e)  The board of commissioners shall hold the public hearing on the date, place and time specified for the purpose of hearing any complaints or objections that may be made by any interested person concerning the need for sewer, the basis for apportioning costs, or the amount of proposed assessment. The board of commissioners shall have the power and duty to review and correct the scope of the project, the apportionment, and assessments, to hear objections to the project, the apportionment, and assessments, and to confirm the project, either as proposed in the resolution or as corrected at the hearing. 
(f)  The board of commissioners shall, at its next regular meeting following the public hearing, place an ordinance on first reading defining the scope of the project, the method of apportionment and the exact amount of assessments imposed against the properties found to be specially benefitted from the project. Such ordinance shall not be final until enacted upon second reading. 
(g)  The city manager shall, not less than 30 days before the date on which payment of an assessment shall be due, cause written notice of the assessment to be sent each affected property owner by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice shall inform the property owner that the assessment is payable to the tax collector of the city in cash and if paid on or before the due date, such assessment shall be without interest. If not paid by the due date, such assessment shall be a lien against the lot or tracts of land so assessed and such lien shall continue until the assessment and the interest are fully paid. Notice of the property owner's right to pay the assessment in installments shall be contained in the notice given by the city manager. 
(h)  No action shall be sustained to set aside any assessment, to enjoin collecting the assessment or issuing execution therefor, or contesting the validity of the assessment on any grounds, unless such action is commenced within 30 days after receipt of the notice provided for in subsection (g) of this section. 
(Code 1968, § 22-55) 
Sec. 94-132. - Alternative manner of payment. 
(a)  When an assessment is imposed against a property owner for the installing and laying of sewer and such owner cannot pay the full amount of the assessment in case on or before the due date, such owner shall have the right to pay the assessment in installments, provided written notice is given the city manager on or before the due date on the following terms: 
(1)  One-fifth of the assessment paid on or before the due date and one-fifth in four annual installments, due on or before the anniversary of the due date, together with interest thereon at eight percent per annum; 
(2)  One-seventh of the assessment paid on or before the due date and one-seventh in six annual installments, due on or before the anniversary of the due date, together with interest thereon at ten percent per annum; or 
(3)  One-tenth of the assessment paid on or before the due date and one-tenth in nine annual installments, due on or before the anniversary of the due date, together with interest thereon at 12 percent per annum; provided, however, this installment option shall only be approved by the city manager if the property owner presents sufficient evidence to justify classification as a hardship case. 
(b)  Should any installment not be paid in full when due, the city manager may notify the property owner that the assessment is in default, whereupon the unpaid balance, with interest, shall be immediately due and payable. Assessments may not be assumed by transferees of the property owner and are due in full upon transfer of title to the property. 
(Code 1968, § 22-56) 
Sec. 94-133. - Enforcement and collection. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of the city manager, within ten days of the due date or the maturity of any installment of assessment or interest, to issue an execution against the lot or tract of land assessed and against the person or persons owning the lot or tract of land for the amount of the assessment and interest. The execution shall be recorded on the general execution docket of the county, and if the owner is a nonresident, in his county of residence. 
(b)  Liens for assessments shall be levied and enforced in the same manner as provided for the collection of taxes. 
(Code 1968, § 22-57) 
Sec. 94-134. - Use of assessments; special fund. 
The assessments levied and collected under this division shall be kept in a special fund to be used and applied for the payment of costs incurred in installing and laying sewer lines for the project identified in the assessment ordinance. No monies in such special fund shall be used for any other purpose until the project costs have been fully satisfied.

Sec. 94-161. - Findings. 
The board of commissioners makes the following findings: 
(1)  The professional engineering and financing analysis, known as the stormwater management action plan, jointly prepared by Ogden Environment and Energy Services and Water Resources, Inc., properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the city. 
(2)  Given the problems, needs, goals, program priorities, and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater systems in the city in concert with other water resource management programs. 
(3)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the corporate limits of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate limits of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
(4)  The stormwater needs in the city include but are not limited to protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. Provision of stormwater management programs and facilities renders and/or results in both service and benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analysis. The service and benefit rendered or resulting from provision of stormwater management systems and facilities may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs, and risk exposure. 
(5)  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by the city, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities in the city in concert with the management of other water resources in the city. In order to do so, the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs. 
(6)  The board of commissioners finds, concludes and determines that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering and funding stormwater management services in the city. 
(7)  An equitable approach to funding stormwater management services and facilities can be provided by adopting a schedule of service charges upon properties that is related to burden of stormwater quality control service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city. Such schedule of service charges can be complemented by other funding methods which address specific needs, including but not limited to allocations of special purpose local options sales taxes to stormwater drainage improvement projects. A service charge credit is an appropriate means of adjusting service charges in recognition that private stormwater systems and/or actions can effectively reduce or eliminate the burden of stormwater quantity and quality control service requirements and costs that a property or properties pose for the city. Impervious area is the most important factor influencing stormwater service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city, and therefore is an appropriate parameter for calculating stormwater service charges and associated credits. In addition, the value to the stormwater utility of certain actions and practices performed by property owners and other stormwater utility customers may be recognized by credits based on other factors, including but not limited to the avoided cost of public information and education realized by the utility when public information and education about stormwater management is provided by the public school system. 
(Ord. No. 99-12, § 1(22-135), 12-14-1999) 
Sec. 94-162. - Establishment of a utility and enterprise fund. 
(a)  There is hereby established a stormwater management utility within the city which shall be responsible for stormwater management throughout the city's corporate limits, and shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater systems and facilities. Such utility shall be under the direction of a stormwater utility director, appointed by the city manager. 
(b)  The city manager shall establish a stormwater enterprise fund in the city budget and accounting system, separate and apart from its general fund, for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the utility, including but not limited to rentals, rates, charges, fees, and licenses as may be established by the board of commissioners. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be deposited promptly upon receipt into the stormwater enterprise fund, to be held and invested in trust for the purposes dedicated, and expended exclusively for purposes of the utility, including capital project construction. No other funds of the city shall be deposited in the stormwater enterprise fund or commingled with dedicated stormwater revenues, except that other revenues, receipts, and resources not accounted for in the stormwater enterprise fund, including grants, loans, and bond proceeds may be combined with and applied to stormwater management capital projects as deemed appropriate by the board of commissioners, upon recommendation of the stormwater utility director. 
(c)  The board of commissioners hereby transfers to the stormwater utility director operational control over the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and heretofore operated by the city and other related assets, including but not limited to properties upon which such facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access, and certain equipment. 
(Ord. No. 99-12, § 1(22-136), 12-14-1999) 
Sec. 94-163. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Credit means a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system or facility or the provision of a service or activity by property owner, which system, facility, service, or activity reduces the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. Credits for on-site stormwater systems shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the site. 
Customers of the stormwater utility means all persons, properties, and entities served by and/or benefiting from the utility's acquisition, management, maintenance, extension, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems and facilities and regulation of public and private stormwater systems, facilities, and activities related thereto, and persons, properties, and entities which will ultimately be served or benefited as a result of the stormwater management program. 
Detached dwelling unit means developed land containing one structure which is not attached to another dwelling and which contains one or more bedrooms, with a bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one family. Detached dwelling units may include houses, manufactured homes, and mobile homes located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Developed land may be classified as a detached dwelling unit despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, or small storage buildings, or the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional impervious areas such as parking spaces, playgrounds, or structures or additions to the building which are used as offices, storage facilities, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship, or similar nonresidential uses. Detached dwelling unit shall not include developed land containing: structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located within manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by others than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes, or multiple dwelling unit residential properties. 
Developed land means property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than 200 square feet of impervious surface as defined in this article. 
Duplex and triplex mean developed land containing two (duplex) or three (triplex) attached residential dwelling units located on one or more parcels of land. 
Equivalent residential unit (ERU) of impervious area means the median average impervious coverage of detached dwelling unit properties in the city as determined by the city, and shall be used as the basis for determining stormwater service charges to detached dwelling unit properties or classes of detached dwelling unit properties and other properties. Two thousand two hundred square feet of impervious area shall be one equivalent unit. 
Hydrologic response means the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious area, the size, shape, topographic, vegetative, and geologic conditions of a property, antecedent moisture conditions, and groundwater conditions on a property. 
Impervious surface means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development. Common impervious areas include, but are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel and soil surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development. 
Multiple dwelling unit residential properties means developed land whereon four or more attached residential dwelling units are located and shall include, but not limited to, apartment houses, condominiums, townhomes, attached single-family homes, boarding houses, group homes, hotels and motels, retirement centers, and other structures in which four or more family groups commonly and normally reside or could reside. In the application of stormwater service charge rates, multiple dwelling unit properties shall be treated as other developed lands. 
Other developed land means, but shall not be limited to, multiple dwelling unit residential properties, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, public and private schools and universities, research stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, water reservoirs, and water and wastewater treatment plants. 
Service charges means the periodic rate, fee, or charge applicable to a parcel of developed land, which charge shall be reflective of the service provided by the city stormwater utility. Service charges are based on measurable parameters which influence the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities, with the most important factor being the amount of impervious area on each parcel of developed land. The use of impervious area as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one or more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management of that property, including but not limited to charges for development plant review, inspection of development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and enhanced levels of stormwater services above those normally provided by the city. 
Stormwater management systems means those systems which address the issues of drainage management (flooding) and environmental quality (pollution, erosion and sedimentation) of receiving rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs through improvements, maintenance, regulation and funding of plants, works, instrumentalities and properties used or useful in the collection, retention, detention, and treatment of stormwater or surface water drainage. 
Undeveloped land means land in its unaltered natural state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or compacted gravel surfaces or structures which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state. For purposes of this article, undeveloped land shall also include property altered from its natural state by the creation or installation of less than 200 square feet of impervious surface.

Cross reference— Cross reference—Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 94-164. - Scope of responsibility for the city drainage system. 
(a)  The city drainage system consists of all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainageways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catch basins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural or manmade, within the political boundaries of the city which control and/or convey stormwater through which the city intentionally diverts surface waters from its public streets and properties. The city owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance and improvements to those segments of this system which (i) are located within public streets, rights-of-way, and easements; (ii) are subject to easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use, or other permanent provisions for adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities; or (iii) are located on public lands to which the city has adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities. Operation and maintenance of stormwater systems and facilities which are located on private property or public property not owned by the city and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems and facilities for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of the systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, or its occupant, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by the laws of the state and the United States of America. 
(b)  It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of all properties and persons in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person or to any specified property within or without the boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity by or upon property not owned by the city, pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of the city or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit or negligent issuance of a permit, seeking the imposition of money damages against the city, its officers, employees or agents. 
(Ord. No. 99-12, § 1(22-138), 12-14-1999) 
Sec. 94-165. - Requirements for on-site stormwater systems; enforcement methods and inspections. 
All property owners and developers of developed real property within the city shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all city development regulations and the laws of the state and the United States of America. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by the city in the Municipal Court. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of the filing of such action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the superior court of the county. The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance. 
(Ord. No. 99-12, § 1(22-139), 12-14-1999) 
Sec. 94-166. - Determination and modification of stormwater service charges. 
Stormwater service charges shall be determined and modified from time to time by resolution of the board of commissioners. In setting or modifying such rates it shall be the objective of the board of commissioners to establish rates, fees and charges that are fair and reasonable, reflect the value of stormwater management services and facilities to those properties who benefit therefrom and, which together with any other sources of revenue that may be made available to the stormwater utility, will be sufficient to meet the cost of budgeted programs, services and facilities, including but not limited to the payment of principal and interest on revenue bond obligations incurred for construction and improvements to the stormwater system. 
(Ord. No. 99-12, § 1(22-140), 12-14-1999) 
Sec. 94-167. - Effective date of stormwater service charges. 
Stormwater service charges shall accrue beginning July 1, 1998, and shall be billed periodically thereafter to customers, except as specific exemptions and credits may apply. 
(Ord. No. 99-12, § 1(22-141), 12-14-1999) 
Sec. 94-168. - Stormwater service charges. 
The following stormwater rates shall apply: 
(1)  Detached dwellings units. Two classes of detached dwelling units shall be billed, based on the amount of impervious surfaces on the individual properties. The class of larger detached dwelling units shall include all detached dwelling unit properties having 1,600 square feet of impervious area or more, which shall be charged the rate applicable to one equivalent residential unit as specified in subsection (c) of this section, or as amended by resolution in the future. The class of smaller detached dwelling units shall include all such properties having less than 1,600 square feet of impervious area, which shall be charged the rate applicable to six-tenths equivalent residential unit as specified below in subsection (c) of this section, or as amended by resolution in the future. 
(2)  Other developed lands. All developed lands not classified as detached dwelling units shall be billed for one equivalent residential unit (ERU) for each 2,200 square feet of impervious surface or increment thereof. 
(3)  Stormwater service charge rate per equivalent residential unit (ERU) or increment thereof. The stormwater service charge per equivalent residential unit shall be as set out in the schedule of fees and charges, per month. 
(Ord. No. 99-12, § 1(22-142), 12-14-1999) 
Sec. 94-169. - Exemptions and credits applicable to stormwater service charges. 
(a)  Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be exempt from stormwater utility service charges or receive a credit or offset against such service charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater service charges shall be granted based on the age, tax, or economic status, race, or religion of the customer, or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. A Stormwater Utility Service Charge Credit Technical Manual has been prepared by the city's consulting engineers specifying the design and performance standards of on-site systems, facilities, activities, and services which quality for application of a service charge credit, and how such credits shall be calculated. This manual has been separately approved by the board of commissioners and, by reference, incorporated in this section. 
(1)  Undeveloped land as defined in this article shall be exempt from stormwater service charges. 
(2)  Land located within a railroad's right of way and covered with ballast and rail shall be exempt from stormwater service charges; provided, however, that railroad stations, maintenance buildings, or other developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater fees. 
(3)  Any real property titled in the name of the State of Georgia, under the custody and control of the State Properties Commission, which property has been determined, in whole or in part, to be useful for the present or future needs of public transportation in this state, shall be exempt from any fees imposed by the city for the management, collection, or disposal of stormwater. 
(b)  Developed land other than individual detached dwelling units, including but not limited to multiple dwelling unit residential properties, manufactured home and mobile home parks, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, public and private schools and universities, research stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces, water reservoirs, and water and wastewater treatment plants may receive a stormwater service charge credit. The stormwater service charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements and standards contained in the Stormwater Utility Service Charge Credit Technical Manual. The stormwater service charge credit may be up to 100 percent of the service charge applicable to a property, and shall be proportional to the extent that on-site systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities. 
(c)  Groups of detached dwelling units represented by an incorporated homeowner's association providing on-site systems, facilities, services, or activities which reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities may receive a stormwater service charge credit. The stormwater service charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements and standards contained in the Stormwater Utility Service Charge Credit Technical Manual. The stormwater service charge credit available to groups of detached dwelling units may be up to 100 percent of the service charge applicable to the individual properties, and shall be proportional to the extent that on-site systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the homeowners association reduce or mitigate the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities. 
(d)  Any credit allowed against the service charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the Stormwater Utility Service Charge Credit Technical Manual and/or upon continuing provision of the systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. A credit may be revoked by the city at any time for noncompliance. 
(e)  In addition to the foregoing credits based upon the design and performance of on-site systems, art educational credit shall be available to all public and private schools or school systems which agree to teach the WATER WISE program, an environmental science curriculum approved by the state department of education, in grades one through 12. The educational credit may be up to 50 percent of the service charge applicable to a school property, and shall be proportional to the extent the approved curriculum is taught.

The purpose of this division is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This division seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
(2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
(3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
(5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
(6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
(7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

The stormwater management plan for each land development project shall provide for stormwater management measures located on the site of the project, unless provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site or regional facility. The off-site or regional facility must be located on property legally dedicated for the purpose, must be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater quantity and quality control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there must be a legally-obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the off-site or regional stormwater facility. In addition, on-site measures shall be implemented, where necessary, to protect upstream and downstream properties and drainage channels from the site to the off-site facility. 
A stormwater management plan must be submitted to the City of Griffin which shows the adequacy of the off-site or regional facility. To be eligible for a modification, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City of Griffin that the use of an off-site or regional facility will not result in the following impacts to upstream or downstream areas: 
(1)  Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, and property; 
(2)  Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures; 
(3)  Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation; 
(4)  Degradation of in-stream biological functions or habitat; or 
(5)  Water quality impairment in violation of state water quality standards, and/or violation of any state or federal regulations. 
(Ord. No. 14-06, § 1, 11-25-2014) 
Sec. 94-194. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria. 
The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this division: 
(a)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge by the stormwater management system to remove at least 80 percent of the calculated average annual post-development Total Suspended Solids (TSS) loading (as defined in the GSMM) from the site. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
(1)  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume, which is defined as the runoff volume resulting from the first 1.2 inches of rainfall from a site; 
(2)  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed, or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and, 
(3)  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the city are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices, and pollution prevention practices. 
(b)  Stream channel/aquatic resource protection. Stream channel/aquatic resource protection shall be provided by using the following approaches: (1) 24-hour extended detention storage of the 1-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event; (2) erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control; and (3) preservation of the applicable stream buffer. 
(c)  Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour storm event. 
(d)  Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood protection shall be provided by controlling the 100-year, 24-hour storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
(e)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the stormwater design manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from City of Griffin before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions, or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the City of Griffin may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. Applicants shall consult the manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
(f)  Nonstructural stormwater controls. The City of Griffin encourages the use of Green Infrastructure/Low Impact Development practices and approaches on both new and redeveloped sites. Design information on GI/LID practices can be found on the Georgia EPD's website (www.gaepd.org) and in the Coastal Supplement to the GSSM. 
(g)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection (a). The applicant may, if approved by the City of Griffin, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the stormwater design manual. 
(h)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public rights-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more that [than] one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements: 
(1)  Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual; 
(2)  All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and, 
(3)  Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the stormwater design manual. 
(i)  Dam design guidelines. Any land disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable. 
(Ord. No. 14-06, § 1, 11-25-2014) 
Sec. 94-195. - Construction inspections of post-development stormwater management system. 
(a)  Inspections to ensure plan compliance during construction. Periodic inspections of the stormwater management system construction shall be conducted by the staff of the City of Griffin or conducted and certified by a professional engineer who has been approved by the city manager. Construction inspections shall utilize the approved stormwater management plan for establishing compliance. All inspections shall be documented with written reports that contain the following information: 
(1)  The date and location of the inspection; 
(2)  Whether construction is in compliance with the approved stormwater management plan; 
(3)  Variations from the approved construction specifications; and 
(4)  Any other variations or violations of the conditions of the approved stormwater management plan. 
If any violations are found, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions. 
(b)  Final inspection and as-built plans. Upon completion of a project, and before a certificate of occupancy shall be granted, the applicant is responsible for certifying that the completed project is in accordance with the approved stormwater management plan. All applicants are required to submit actual asbuilt plans for any stormwater management facilities or practices after final construction is completed. The plan must show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and practices and must be certified, under seal, by a professional engineer. A final inspection by the city stormwater management department is required before the release of any performance bonds or other security can occur. 
(Ord. No. 14-06, § 1, 11-25-2014) 
Sec. 94-196. - Long-term maintenance and inspection of stormwater facilities and practices. 
(a)  Long-term maintenance and inspection of post-construction stormwater facilities and practices. Stormwater management facilities and practices included in a stormwater management plan which are subject to an inspection and maintenance agreement must undergo ongoing inspections to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of the maintenance agreement, the stormwater management plan and this division. At a minimum, all this inspection shall address all publicly-owned structures and those privately-owned structures completed on or after October 9, 2007. The city may also inspect privately-owned structures completed before this date if the city has entered into an inspection and maintenance agreement with the owner/operator of the structure. Maintenance must be performed to the "maximum extent practicable" (MEP). 
A stormwater management facility or practice shall be inspected on a periodic basis by the responsible person in accordance with the approved inspection and maintenance agreement. In the event that the stormwater management facility has not been maintained and/or becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the city manager shall notify the person responsible for carrying out the maintenance plan by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested or statutory overnight delivery to the person specified, at the last address given in the inspection and maintenance agreement. Responsible persons are under a continuing obligation to keep the city informed of their current mailing address or other contact information. The notice shall specify the measures needed to comply with the agreement and the plan and shall specify the time within which such measures shall be completed. If the responsible person fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the inspection and maintenance agreement, the city may correct the violation as provided in subsection (d) hereof. 
Inspection programs by the City of Griffin may be established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in stormwater management facilities; and evaluating the condition of stormwater management facilities and practices. 
(b)  Right-of-entry for inspection. The terms of the inspection and maintenance agreement shall provide for the City of Griffin to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when it has a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this division is occurring or has occurred and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a violation of this article. 
(c)  Records of maintenance activities. Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management facility shall provide records of all maintenance and repairs to the City of Griffin. 
(d)  Failure to maintain facilities and practices. If a responsible person fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the inspection and maintenance agreement, the city manager, after ten days' written notice (except, that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, 24 hours' notice shall be sufficient), may correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance requirements by performing the necessary work to place the facility or practice in proper working condition. The city manager shall specially assess the owner(s) of the facility for the cost of repair work which shall be a lien on the property, and may cause the amount thereof to be placed on the next ad valorem tax bill for such property and collected in the ordinary manner for collection of taxes. 
(Ord. No. 14-06, § 1, 11-25-2014) 
Sec. 94-197. - Violations, enforcement and penalties. 
Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of this article or the requirements of an approved stormwater management plan or permit, may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this division. Any such action or inaction which is continuous with respect to time is deemed to be a public nuisance and may be abated by injunctive or other equitable relief. The imposition of any of the penalties described below shall not prevent such equitable relief. 
(a)  Notice of violation. If the city manager or his designee determines that an applicant or other responsible person has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of a permit, an approved stormwater management site plan or the provisions of this division, he shall issue a written notice of violation to such applicant or other responsible person. Where a person is engaged in activity covered by this division without having first secured a permit therefor, the notice of violation shall be served on the owner of the property or the responsible person in charge of the activity being conducted on the site. 
The notice of violation shall contain: 
(1)  The name and address of the owner or the applicant or the responsible person; 
(2)  The address or other description of the site upon which the violation is occurring; 
(3)  A statement specifying the nature of the violation; 
(4)  A description of the remedial measures necessary to bring the action or inaction into compliance with the permit, the stormwater management plan or this article and the date for the completion of such remedial action; and 
(5)  A statement of the penalty or penalties that may be assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed. 
(b)  Enforcement measures. In the event the remedial measures described in the notice of violation have not been completed by the date set forth for completion in the notice of violation, any one or more of the following actions or penalties may be taken or assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation was directed: 
(1)  Stop work order. The city manager may issue a stop work order which shall be served on the owner or other responsible person. The stop work order shall remain in effect until the owner or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violation or violations described therein, provided the stop work order may be withdrawn or modified to enable the owner or other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such violation or violations. 
(2)  Withhold certificate of occupancy. The city manager shall refuse to issue a certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements constructed or being constructed on the site until the owner or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations described therein. 
(3)  Suspension, revocation or modification of permit. The city manager may suspend, revoke or modify the permit authorizing the land development project. A suspended, revoked or modified permit may be reinstated after the owner or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations described therein, provided such permit may be reinstated upon such conditions as the city manager may deem necessary to enable the owner or other responsible person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such violations. 
(c)  Civil penalties. In the event the owner or other responsible person fails to take the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or otherwise fails to cure the violations described therein within ten days, or such greater period as the city manager shall deem appropriate (except, that in the event the violation constitutes an immediate danger to public health or public safety, 24 hours' notice shall be sufficient) after the city manager has taken one or more of the actions described above, the city manager may file a complaint for nuisance against the applicant or other responsible person in Municipal Court; upon finding a nuisance to exist by reason of the condition, the court shall order the nuisance abated within a reasonable time. In addition thereto, the court may impose a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.00 (depending on the severity of the violation) for each day the violation remains unremedied after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(d)  Criminal penalties. For intentional and willful violations of this division, including engaging in a land disturbing activity without first obtaining the required permit, the city manager may issue a citation to the applicant or other responsible person, requiring such person to appear before the Municipal Court to answer charges for such violation. Upon conviction, such person shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00, imprisonment for six months, or both. Each act of violation and each day upon which any violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense.

ARTICLE V. - ATLANTA GAS LIGHT COMPANY FRANCHISE 

Sec. 94-201. - Grant of franchise. 
An ordinance dated June 21, 1983, granting Atlanta Gas Light Company a franchise for the use of rights-of-way and other public property for the purpose of distributing gas within the City of Griffin, is hereby amended by inserting the following: 
(Ord. No. 98-15, § 1, 9-22-1998) 
Sec. 94-202. - Definitions. 
(a)  Base year means the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998. 
(b)  Base year franchise fee factor means the total franchise fees paid during the base year divided by the design day capacity as recorded by the company on the last day of the base year. 
(c)  Design day capacity means the sum of the individual capacity in dekatherms (Dt) attributable to all firm customers located within the city limits of the city, as of the last day of the previous fiscal year. 
(d)  Firm customers means all residential and business customers who purchase gas service that ordinarily is not subject to interruption or curtailment. 
(e)  Fiscal year means the 12 months ending September 30 of each year. 
(f)  Inflation index means the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or any successor index, for the period from September 30, 1997, to the beginning of the then current fiscal year. The percentage shall be reduced by any productivity factor adjustment for the same time period determined by the Georgia Public Service Commission for the company. 
(Ord. No. 98-15, § 1(1), 9-22-1998) 
Cross reference— Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 94-203. - Franchise fee. 
The total dollar amount of franchise fees paid by the company to the city shall be calculated as follows: 
The current fiscal year total franchise fee shall equal the product of the design day capacity and the current franchise fee factor. The current franchise fee factor shall be equal to the product of the base year franchise fee factor and one plus the inflation index expressed as a decimal to three significant digits. 
The following formula quantifies this payment: 
FF c = FFF by × (1 + CPI - PFA) × DDC c 
Where FF c = total franchise fees due the city for the current fiscal year 
FFF by = the base year franchise fee factor 
CPI-PFA = the inflation index based on the cumulative changed in the Consumer Price Index less the productivity factor adjustment determined by the Georgia Public Service Commission 
DDC c = the design day capacity as of the last day of the previous fiscal year 
FFF by =FF by /DDC by where 
FF by = the total franchise fees paid in the base year 
and DDC by = the design day capacity of the base year. 
(Ord. No. 98-15, § 1(2), 9-22-1998) 
Sec. 94-204. - Responsibility for payment of franchise fee. 
The company as the holder of the franchise privilege hereunder is responsible for the payment of all franchise fees payable hereunder, and shall file such reports and returns as required by franchise ordinance as modified by this amendment. In addition, the company shall report annually the names of all gas marketers for which the company is transporting natural gas on the distribution system within the city. The franchise fee payments required hereunder shall be in lieu of any franchise fee license fee, occupation tax or other payment for use of the rights-of-way by the company for the provision of gas service, but shall not prohibit imposition of a license fee or an occupation tax on gas marketers. 
(Ord. No. 98-15, § 1(3), 9-22-1998) 
Sec. 94-205. - Quarterly payments. 
Effective for the fiscal year 1999, and for each fiscal year thereafter during the term of the franchise ordinance, the company shall remit to the city quarterly franchise fee installments. The installments shall equal to one-fourth of the total annual franchise fee calculated in accordance with this ordinance. 
The quarterly payment is due and payable on or before the 30th day following the last day of each calendar quarter. 
(Ord. No. 98-15, § 1(4), 9-22-1998)

Sec. 94-207. - Delay of inflation adjustment. 
Notwithstanding any other provision in this ordinance, any inflation adjustments shall be made to the franchise fee only when the company changes its rates. 
(Ord. No. 98-15, § 1(6), 9-22-1998) 
Sec. 94-208. - Conflicts. 
In the event of a conflict between this ordinance and the original franchise dated June 21, 1983, this ordinance shall control. All terms, conditions and stipulations contained in such franchise ordinance shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that they do not conflict with this ordinance.

ARTICLE VI. - COMBINED PUBLIC UTILITIES SYSTEM 

Sec. 94-251. - Combined public utilities system; departments created. 
The city owns an electric system, water distribution system and sewer collection system which provides electric service, water service and sewer service to users within and without the territorial limits of the city. Collectively, these systems shall be operated and maintained as a combined public utilities system. The city manager shall direct and control the operation of said combined system, but may operate such system through separate utility divisions, i.e. electric, water, and sewer, or in such combination as he deems most efficient. 
(Ord. No. 02-18, § 1(1), 11-12-2002) 
Sec. 94-252. - Utilities system accounts; establishment of rates. 
The city manager shall keep separate financial books and accounts for the electric, water and sewer departments and for the combined utilities system. It shall be the duty of the manager to place into effect, with approval of the board of commissioners, schedules of rates, tolls, fees and charges for the services, facilities and commodities furnished by the combined system and, as often as it may appear necessary, to revise and adjust such schedules to the extent necessary to produce funds sufficient to: 
(1)  Pay the operating expenses of the combined system; 
(2)  Pay the principal and interest when due on any revenue bonds and debt obligations of the combined system, including funding of any debt service reserves or credit reserves required thereby; and 
(3)  Fund any minimum renewal and extension fund requirements as established by bond ordinance or other proper resolution of the board of commissioners; 
at least equal to 120 percent of the amount required for the then current fiscal year or accounting period; provided, however, for each of the systems operated, a schedule of rates, tolls, fees and charges for the services, facilities and commodities furnished by each individual system shall be imposed so as to operate each individual system on a sound businesslike basis. For purposes of this section, a system will be deemed to have operated on a sound businesslike basis if net revenues of each individual system at least equal 100 percent of that portion of estimated operating expense, plus debt service, allocable to that system during the current budget period. Such rates, fees, tolls and charges will be classified in a reasonable manner to cover users of the services and facilities furnished by the combined system so that, as nearly as practicable, such rates, fees, tolls and charges will be uniform in application to all users falling within any reasonable class. No free service will at any time be furnished, including to any political subdivision or other public body. No customer will be connected to the combined system or any individual utility thereof without first having executed a service agreement in the form prescribed by the city manager, and paid the applicable connection fees and charges. Where applicable, a proper meter shall first be installed before services or commodities are delivered. To the extent authorized by law, it shall be the duty of the city manager to require the owners of all improved properties accessible to services of the combined system to connect thereto. 
(Ord. No. 02-18, § 1(2), 11-12-2002) 
Sec. 94-253. - Employees of combined system; department managers. 
The city manager shall employ persons skilled or knowledgeable in the management of utilities and may designate one or more department managers for the combined system or its individual departments. All compensation, salaries, fees and wages paid in the operation, maintenance and repair of the combined system shall be reasonable, and no more persons shall be employed than are necessary. Employees of the combined system shall be eligible to participate in all retirement, insurance and employment benefit programs of the city. 
(Ord. No. 02-18, § 1(3), 11-12-2002) 
Sec. 94-254. - Operation of combined system. 
The city manager, department managers and employees of the combined system shall continuously operate and maintain the facilities of said system in good order and repair in accordance with reasonable rules and regulations governing said system as from time to time established by the city manager, upon recommendation of his department managers. All rules shall be in writing and conspicuously posted in the individual utility departments and at the city manager's office. Where subject to governmental or administrative oversight, the combined system shall be operated in strict compliance with all valid acts, rules, regulations, orders, permits and directives of regulatory bodies or agencies. The city manager, department managers and key employees of the combined system or of the city who handle funds derived from the combined system shall carry fidelity bonds, in favor of the board of commissioners, in such amounts as are at least equal to the total funds in the custody of such officer or officers at any time. 
(Ord. No. 02-18, § 1(4), 11-12-2002) 
Sec. 94-255. - Audit of combined system. 
As soon as practicable after the closing of each fiscal year, an audit will be made of all books and accounts pertaining to the combined system and each individual utility department by an independent certified public accountant or firm of suitable experience and responsibility. Copies of such audit shall be made available to the board of commissioners and to interested persons as a public record of the city. 
(Ord. No. 02-18, § 1(5), 11-12-2002) 
Sec. 94-256. - Right to shut off utilities for repair; emergencies. 
The city manager and his department managers shall have the right to shut off utilities for necessary repairs and work upon the system; provided, however, shut-offs shall be planned to the extent possible and reasonable notice given to users by the best available means; in any emergency situation, notice of a shut-off is not required. The city will exercise its best efforts to restore normal levels of service as soon as feasible, considering the nature of the situation and all circumstances. The city shall not be responsible for damages or rebate of fees, rates, tolls and charges for temporary outages or shut-offs, or for compensatory damages allegedly arising from loss of utility services. 
(Ord. No. 02-18, § 1(6), 11-12-2002) 
Sec. 94-257. - Termination of services due to non-payment or other cause. 
In the absence of a written contract with the city creating a property interest or legitimate expectation of continued service, utility users may be terminated due to violation of published rules, regulations and procedures governing service delivery and billing practices of the combined system as promulgated by the city manager. Where customers are subject to termination of services due to non-payment, it shall be the policy of the city to afford the customer a reasonable opportunity for a meeting with a responsible employee of the combined system's customer service division to resolve any dispute prior to the scheduled date of termination. Where notice cannot be given the customer, as shown on the combined system's billing records, or known users at the location where service is provided, after reasonable diligence by the city staff, the city shall retain the right to terminate service upon concluding the amount billed was justly due. Failure by a customer to receive a bill for the current period shall not constitute a defense for non-payment when services are shown to have been accepted at the service address. 
Pursuant to section 366 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. § 366), the combined utility may not alter, refuse, or discontinue service for 20 days after receiving notice of entry of an order for relief under the Bankruptcy Code. Within 20 days after the date of entry of such order, the debtor or trustee acting on the debtor's behalf, shall furnish adequate assurance of payment, in the form of a deposit or other security, to maintain utility service after that date. The amount of such adequate assurance may vary based upon the circumstances of each case. 
(Ord. No. 02-18, § 1(7), 11-12-2002) 
Sec. 94-258. - Damaging, injuring, or interfering with property of the combined system.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 14-05, § 1, adopted Nov. 25, 2014, repealed the former Art. VII, §§ 94-301—94-310, and enacted a new Art. VII as set out herein. The former Art. VII pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 03-07, § 1, adopted March 11, 2003; Ord. No. 04-13, § 1, adopted June 22, 2004; Ord. No. 05-01, § 1, adopted Feb. 8, 2005. 

Sec. 94-301. - Legal compliance. 
The City of Griffin Public Water System operates in compliance with O.C.G.A. § 12-5-170 et seq., "The Georgia Safe Drinking Water Act"; Rules and Regulations of the State of Georgia, § 391-3-5-.13, which pertains to safe drinking water standards; and Permit No. CS2550000, issued February 2, 2006, Permit to Operate a Public Water System. 
(Ord. No. 14-05, § 1, 11-25-2014) 
Sec. 94-302. - Cross-connection control program. 
(a)  General description of backflow and backflow prevention. 
(1)  Water distribution systems are designed with the intention of the water flowing in a certain direction from the distribution system to the customer. However, hydraulic conditions within the system may deviate from the "normal" conditions, causing the water to flow in the opposite direction. Therefore, it is possible (and common) for the water to flow in the opposite direction in an unprotected system. This is called "backflow." 
(2)  Backflow occurs when the pressure in the distribution system drops, siphoning water from the customer's system into the distribution system. This would also siphon any substance which may be in contact with the water system through a cross-connection. This type of backflow is called "backsiphonage" and may occur when there is an unusually high use of water or undersized piping in an area. For example, during fire fighting, or when a main water line breaks, water is "sucked" to the point of high usage, possibly drawing non-potable substances with it, filling the water line with these substances. Backsiphonage may occur through cross-connection such as a hose from a maintenance sink in a mop bucket, or a below-the-rim water inlet to a tank containing a toxic solution. 
(3)  Some water customers have non-potable materials on the premises under pressure. When an unprotected water line is attached to the container or pipes holding the pressurized material, the material may be "pumped" back into the potable water system. This type of backflow is called "backpressure." Backpressure may occur through a cross-connection such as a make-up water line, which is connected, to a recirculating system containing soap, acid, antifreeze or any other non-potable substance. 
(4)  Because of these potential dangers to the water consumer, it is necessary to control cross-connections. There are several types of mechanical assemblies which serve as backflow preventers. Different types of backflow preventers are designed to work under backsiphonage or backpressure conditions. Some are acceptable for low-hazard (or non-health hazard) conditions. 
(5)  This article regulates the proper use of backflow prevention devices and assemblies. 
(b)  Responsibility. 
(1)  The director of the water and wastewater department has the primary responsibility for protecting the public water system against backflow and back-siphonage. This responsibility begins at the water supply source, includes all of the public water distribution system, and generally ends at the point of water delivery to the customer's premises or system. The city water and wastewater department is not responsible for abatement of cross-connections within a customer's premises but rather undertakes reasonable precautions to protect the public water system from backflow through illegal cross-connections. Taking reasonable precautions includes ensuring that proper backflow preventers are installed and maintained by the customer, at its sole expense, at the point of service connection. 
(2)  The installation of a backflow preventer at a service connection in accordance with this section may not negate the need for additional backflow preventers at points of water use within the customer's potable water system. 
(3)  Authority is hereby delegated to the director to promulgate and adopt a manual setting forth a Cross-Connection Control Program for the elimination and prevention of all cross-connections, in accordance with this article. Such program shall conform to the standards of the American Water Works Association, Manual 14, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Cross-Connection Manual. Said Manual shall be submitted to the Georgia Environmental Protection Division of the Department of Natural Resources upon completion.

Sec. 94-303. - Definitions. 
As used in this article, the terms defined below shall have the specific meaning ascribed in this section. 
Approved: Accepted, after review, by the city water and wastewater department. 
Assembly: A mechanical backflow preventer (e.g., PVB, DC, RP, etc.), used to prevent the backward flow of contaminants or pollutants into a potable water distribution system. An assembly has a resilient seated, full-flow shut-off valve before and after the backflow preventer making it testable in-line. (The assembly is shipped with the shut-off valves attached to the backflow preventer). An assembly is labeled with the manufacturer's symbol, the size and model number, the working pressure and the direction of flow. Parts for the approved assembly are provided for a minimum of seven years after sale of the assembly. The Foundation for Cross-Connection Control and Hydraulic Research at the University of Southern California approves backflow prevention assemblies. 
Auxiliary water supply: Any water supply on or available to the premises other than the city public water system. These auxiliary waters may include water from another purveyor's public potable water or any natural source(s) such as well, spring, river, stream, harbor, etc., or "used waters" or "industrial fluids". These waters may be polluted or contaminated or they may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the city does not have sanitary control. 
Backflow: The undesirable reversal of flow of water or other substances through a cross-connection and into the piping of a public water system or customer's potable water system. This includes backflow from backsiphonage or backpressure. 
Backflow preventer: A device assembly, or means designed to prevent backflow, including: 
(1)  Air-gap (AG): The unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between: the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device; and the flood level rim of such vessel. An approved AG shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe, measured vertically, above the top of the rim of the vessel; and, in no case less than one inch. When an AG is used at the service connection to prevent the contamination or pollution of the public potable water system, an emergency by-pass shall be installed around the AG system and an approved reduced pressure principle device shall be installed on the by-pass system. 
(2)  Reduced pressure principle assembly (RP): An assembly of two independently operating approved check valves with an automatically operating differential relief valve between the two check valves, tightly closing shut-off valves on either side of the check valves, plus properly located test cocks for the testing of the check and relief valves. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance specifications and approval of a recognized and city approved testing agency for backflow prevention assemblies. The device shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two check valves at a level less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the device. At cessation of normal flow, the pressure between the two check valves shall be less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the device. In case of leakage of either of the check valves, the differential relief valve shall operate to maintain the reduced pressure in the zone between the check valves by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two pound per square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere. To be approved, these devices must be readily accessible for in-line maintenance and testing and be installed in a location where no part of the device will be submerged. 
(3)  Double check valve assembly (DC): An assembly of two independently operating approved check valves with tightly shut off valves on each side of the check valves, plus properly located test cocks for the testing of each check valve. The entire assembly shall meet the design and performance specifications and approval of a recognized and city approved testing agency for backflow prevention devices. To be approved, these devices must be readily accessible for in-line maintenance and testing. 
(4)  Pressure vacuum breaker assembly (PVB): An assembly consisting of one independently operating spring loaded check valve, an independently operating, spring loaded air-inlet valve, two test cocks and two shut off valves. This assembly is designed to prevent backsiphonage. It cannot be used where it may be subjected to back pressure. It can be operated under continuous pressure. 
(5)  Spill-resistant pressure vacuum breaker assembly (SVB): An assembly containing an independently operating internally loaded check valve and independently operating loaded air inlet valve located on the discharge side of the check valve. The assembly is to be equipped with a properly located resilient seated test cock, a properly located bleed/vent valve, and tightly closing resilient seated shutoff valves attached at each end of the assembly. This assembly is designed to protect against a non-health hazard (i.e., pollutant) or a health hazard (i.e., contaminant) under a backsiphonage condition only. 
(6)  Atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB): A mechanical backflow prevention device consisting of a float check valve and an air inlet port designed to prevent backsiphonage by allowing air to enter the downstream water line. This unit does not provide protection against backpressure or continuous pressure. (A shut-off valve is not allowed down stream from the device to prevent the device from being subjected to continuous pressure). 
(7)  Residential dual check (RDC): A compact unit manufactured with two independent spring actuated check valves. The residential dual check is acceptable only: as on a residential system that has no irrigation or anything that may be close to anything in Table 1 Appendix A. 
Backflow prevention inspector: The employee tasked by the director to inspect and test back flow preventers, who possesses the qualifications of and certification by the Georgia Statewide Backflow Prevention Assembly Certification Program. 
City: The City of Griffin, Georgia, its officers, employees, and authorized agents. 
Contamination: An impairment of the quality of the potable water by sewage, industrial fluids or waste liquids, compounds or other materials to a degree which creates an actual or potential hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of disease. 
Cross-connection: Any physical arrangement whereby a public water supply is connected, directly or indirectly, with any other water supply system, sewer, drain, conduit, pool, storage reservoir, plumbing fixture, or other device which contains or may contain contaminated water, sewage or other waste, or liquid of unknown or unsafe quality which may be capable of imparting contamination to the public water supply as the result of backflow. By-pass arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections, swivel or changeable devices, and other temporary or permanent devices through which or because of which backflow could occur are considered to be cross-connections. 
Cross-connections—Controlled: A connection between a potable water system and a non-potable water system with an approved backflow prevention assembly properly installed that will continuously afford the protection commensurate with the degree of hazard. 
Department: The Water and Wastewater Department of the City of Griffin, Georgia. 
Device: A mechanical backflow preventer without the shut-off valves. An atmospheric vacuum breaker is a device. It does not have shut-off valves on either side of the backflow prevention mechanism. In addition, any backflow prevention assembly without the shut off valves is called a device. The American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Society of Sanitary Engineers (ASSE) approve backflow prevention devices. 
Director: The director of the city's water and wastewater department. 
Pollution: Means the presence of any foreign substance (organic, inorganic, or biological) in water which tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute a hazard or impair the usefulness or quality of the water to a degree which does not create an actual hazard to the public health but which does adversely and unreasonably affect such waters for domestic use. 
Water, potable: Any water that, according to recognized standards is safe for human consumption. 
Water, nonpotable: Water that is not safe for human consumption or which is of questionable potability. 
Water service connection: The terminal end of a service connection from the public potable water system; i.e., where the city loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the customer's water system. If a meter is installed at the end of the service connection, then the service connection shall mean the downstream end of the meter. There should be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of any meter or backflow prevention device located at the point of delivery to the customer's water system. Service connections shall also include water service connections from a fire hydrant and all other temporary or emergency water service connections from the public potable water systems. 
(Ord. No. 14-05, § 1, 11-25-2014)

a.  Director of the department; 
b.  Spalding County Health Department; 
c.  Georgia Environmental Protection Division. 
(3)  The responding individuals shall determine the extent of contamination, by taking samples for testing, and shall take appropriate measures to clear the contamination from the public water supply. After clearing the contaminate from the public water supply, the department shall perform a survey of the customer's lines to determine and eliminate the cause. A boiled water notice will be issued, if necessary, based upon identified contaminates from sample test results, if any, or lack of chlorine residual. The city shall have the right to disconnect the customer from the public water system and to require a backflow preventer to be installed, at the customer's cost, as a condition for continued service. 
(f)  Procedures for educating the public about cross-connection controls. At least once every three years the department shall conduct a public education activity aimed at improving general customer awareness about cross-connection control through methods such as: bill inserts, pamphlets or booklets, posters or billboards, public service announcements, articles or stories in the news media, seminars or workshops, or school lectures or presentations. Whenever a new service connection is made, or there is a switch in the customer of record, the department shall deliver to the new customer of record an educational pamphlet addressing the importance of the customer installing and/or maintaining anti-siphon toilet tank valves and hose bib vacuum breakers that conform to the Georgia State Minimum Standard Plumbing Code. 
(Ord. No. 14-05, § 1, 11-25-2014) 
Sec. 94-305. - Notice to disconnect from public water system. 
Any person who now has cross-connections, auxiliary intakes, by-passes, or inter-connections in violation of this article shall be required, upon written notice from the director, to disconnect such prohibited connections from the city public water system. Depending on the nature of the connection found and risk hazard imposed, the director shall state in his notice the time within which the disconnection shall be completed. If the customer or person in control of the premises where a prohibited connection is found fails or refuses to disconnect such connection within the time specified, the director may cause disconnection to occur at the customer's service connection, including removal of the meter. No reconnection to the public water system shall be permitted or occur until the director is satisfied that corrective work has been performed that conforms to the Georgia State Minimum Standard Plumbing Code and certification from the customer that the work was performed by a state licensed plumber.

ARTICLE IX. - EASEMENT ACQUISITION POLICY 

Sec. 94-375. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this article is to prescribe a procedure, pursuant to the authority of O.C.G.A. § 22-1-9 (2), to waive the requirement that affected real property be appraised prior to the initiation of negotiations for acquisition, when the interest to be acquired is less than fee simple (i.e. an easement or lesser interest) and the just compensation for the acquisition is significantly likely to be of low fair market value. 
(Ord. No. 09-01, § 1, 2-24-2009) 
Sec. 94-376. - Procedure for easement acquisition; determination of minimum initial offer. 
(a)  The city shall identify the easement area required, together with any additional land area needed for temporary construction of the project, on final plans and specifications, prepared by a design professional in accordance with the general policies of the city for acquisition of real properties for public works projects and related purposes. A preliminary title examination shall be conducted for each parcel to identify its owner(s) of record and the parties interested therein, including lienholders and mortgagees. 
(b)  Using the current Spalding County tax assessment for the affected parcel, the city shall use the appraised value of the land only (exclusive of any improvements), as its basis to calculate a unit value (for example, dollars per square foot) for the parcel as a whole. 
(c)  For a permanent easement, the city shall multiply the unit value (i.e. dollar per square foot) by the approximate number of units (i.e. square footage) in the easement; 40 percent of the resulting amount shall constitute the minimum initial offer for the permanent easement (Note: 40 percent represents the value of the easement in relation to the fair market value of the land in fee simple). 
(d)  Where additional land area is needed during the project construction period, a temporary construction easement shall be obtained, using the method set forth in subpart (c) above, provided, however, the percentage multiplier shall be ten percent (representing annual fair rental return of land area affected). The resulting amount shall constitute the minimum initial offer for the temporary construction easement. 
(e)  In establishing the minimum initial offer to be made to the property owner, by resolution, the commission may take into consideration any factors unique to the particular parcel from which the easement is taken. The amount established by this method shall be the minimum just compensation offered and shall form the basis for negotiations with property owners and interested parties. 
(Ord. No. 09-01, § 1, 2-24-2009; Ord. No. 13-06, § 1, 5-14-2013) 
Sec. 94-377. - Procedure for easement acquisition; presentation of options to property owner(s) and interested parties. 
(a)  It is the intention of the board of commissioners that the acquisition of an easement or less than fee simple interest in real property generally follow the policies and practices set forth in "The Landowner's Bill of Rights and Private Property Protection Act", Ga. Laws 2006, Act 444, as codified in Title 22 of the O.C.G.A., except for the waiver of appraisal when the resulting fair market value of a lesser land interest is likely to be low; provided, however, such policies shall not be applicable to condemnations brought pursuant to Title 32, O.C.G.A. 
(b)  The process to acquire a required easement shall be initiated by letter from the city manager to the land owner(s), with copies to other interested parties as shown upon the title certificate, setting forth the following options: 
(1)  The right of the owner(s) to request the city obtain an independent fee appraisal, which shall become the minimum offer for just compensation (NOTE: this could be lower than the minimum initial offer established in the foregoing section of this article); 
(2)  The election of the owner(s) to negotiate based upon the minimum initial offer as established by resolution of the commission in accordance with the foregoing section of this article; or 
(3)  The opportunity for the owner(s) to donate the required easement and receive a letter from the city acknowledging receipt of the donation, based either on the established initial offer or actual appraised value. 
(c)  The letter shall include a copy of the "Landowners Notice of Rights", as published by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs, in its most current version. 
(d)  When easements and interests in land less than fee simple are acquired in accordance with this article, the city attorney shall cause the easement or legal instrument to be recorded in the land records of the county and a final title certification to issue, reflecting the interests sought by the city were properly obtained. Upon recommendation of the city attorney, the city manager may procure a policy of title insurance for such easement(s).

Editor's note— Ord. No. 02-04, § 1, adopted March 12, 2002, revised art. II of this chapter in its entirety. Prior to revision, art. II, §§ 98-31—98-45, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the 1968 Code, App. 7, §§ 1—15. Diagrams and illustrations within Ord. No. 02-04 and the administrative guidelines for tree conservation and planting have not been included herein, but may be found attached to Ord. No. 02-04, on file in the office of the city clerk. 

Sec. 98-31. - Findings. 
The city is blessed with a diversity and abundance of trees and shrubs on public and private lands. Such trees and shrubs are of economic value to the city and make it a desirable place for both residents and visitors. The appearance of the city to passersby along city streets contributes to the economic prosperity of the city. Trees are proven producers of oxygen, a necessary element to the survival of man, and appreciably reduce carbon dioxide content in the air. Trees collect dust and other particulate airborne pollutants. They transpire considerable amounts of water each day. Their root systems stabilize the ground water. Trees play an important part in community-wide soil conservation and erosion control, and reduce stormwater runoff. They contribute food and shelter for wildlife in urban and suburban environments. They provide shade and reduce the ground temperature in wooded areas, plus provide windbreaks, visual and sound barriers. Trees have an economic and aesthetic value to the city. Trees increase property values, can positively affect an area economically, and beautify the landscape. Furthermore, certain streets have historically constituted significant and attractive tree-lined corridors, which have contributed to a realization of increased property values and general improvement of corresponding neighborhoods. 
The age of the city's urban forest, coupled with new growth and development in the city, often necessitates the removal of trees, shrubs, and soils, thereby contributing to urban forest depletion. It is necessary to protect and manage trees and their habitat in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
(Ord. No. 02-04, § 1(1), 3-12-2002) 
Sec. 98-32. - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose of this article is to protect, through proper care and policy, the existing urban forest in the city, by regulating and controlling the planting, conservation, and replacement of trees and shrubbery on public lands within the city, thereby maintaining and enhancing the quality of life for which the city is noted; to reconfirm that the public lands of this city and all trees and other woody vegetation thereon are and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of all of the citizens of this community for their use and enjoyment; to conserve and protect said public lands and vegetation from destruction, damage, conversion or abuse for the benefit of ourselves and future generations; to encourage the citizens of the community to conserve and respect our urban forests; to protect and enhance the city's tree lined corridors, and to encourage the replacement of trees on public and private lands in order to maintain this valuable resource as an integral part of this community's environment.

(1)  The city shall have the right to plant, prune, maintain and remove trees, shrubs, and other plants within the right-of-way of all streets, alleys, avenues, lanes, on all public lands, and on all city utility easements, as may be necessary to insure public safety, to conserve or enhance the symmetry and beauty of the city, or to further the intent of this article. 
(2)  The tree board may remove or cause or order to be removed, any tree, shrub or part thereof which is in an unsafe condition or which, by reason of its nature, is injurious to sewers, electric power lines, gas lines, water lines, or other public improvements, or is infected with any injurious fungus, insect, or other pest. 
(3)  The planting of shade trees by adjacent property owners on public rights-of-way is allowable provided that the selection and location of trees is in accordance with the provisions of this article and the administrative guidelines, is otherwise in conformity with city plans, and poses no risk to existing utility facilities. Planting of trees and/or shrubs on public lands other than rights-of-way adjacent to a property owner's property, may be permitted by the director of public works where such planting conforms to specific planting plans previously adopted by the city or on a case by case basis in the discretion of the tree board, upon proper application, and upon a finding by the tree board that such planting would be in accordance with the city's overall plans for development and use of the property at issue, would not pose a hazard to any existing trees, shrubbery, utility infrastructure or buildings and that the proposed planting is in the best interest of the city and is consistent with the aims of this article. 
(b)  Tree topping/cutting/tree attachments. It shall be unlawful as a normal practice for any person, to top any street tree, park tree, or other tree on public lands. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees under utility wires or other obstructions, where other pruning practices are impractical, may be exempted from this article at the determination of the tree board and topped or cut by city employees or city designated contractors. Likewise, it shall be a violation of this article for any person to attach to any tree on public lands any rope, wire, chain, sign, or other devices whatsoever, other than devices approved by the city arborist for the protection of newly planted trees. 
(c)  Tree pruning. 
(1)  Pruning of trees on public lands shall be limited to city employees and city engaged contractors and shall be done in accordance with the administrative guidelines. 
(2)  Pruning specifications are as follows: 
a.  Fine pruning. Fine pruning is appropriate for trees with minor root damage (less than or equal to 20 percent of the critical root zone disturbed), and/or for the maintenance of health, appearance, and safety of non-disturbed trees. 
b.  Drop crotch pruning. This practice is to be undertaken only where moderate to severe root damage has occurred, when necessary. 
(d)  Trimming responsibility for trees and other vegetation. 
(1)  The owner or occupant of property adjacent to public rights-of-way or other public lands, upon whose property trees, shrubs, flowers, or vines are located that have branches, limbs, trunks, or other parts projecting into the public rights-of-way or onto other public lands, shall be responsible for pruning such branches, limbs, trunks or other projecting parts so they do not interfere with the free and safe passage along the public rights-of-way by pedestrians and vehicular traffic. 
(2)  If the owner of private property does not keep the tree growth, limbs and shrubbery from projecting into or on public lands, then the city arborist shall have the authority to order removal of such projecting growth. The order shall be acted upon by the owner within 15 days from the time of the receipt of the notice, which shall be hand delivered or sent by registered mail, return receipt requested. If, after 15 days, the owner has not responded or acted to remove the projecting growth, then the public works director or his designee shall have the authority to enter upon the owner's property to perform the work and the cost of such work shall constitute a lien on the owner's property. Provided that where dead, injured or diseased trees or projections therefrom pose an imminent threat to the public safety, the city may enter onto private property and trim or remove such trees or portions thereof as to secure the public from harm, providing such notice to the owner as practicable. 
(e)  Removal of stumps. All stumps of trees on public lands shall be removed below the surface of the ground so that the top of the stump shall not project above the surface of the ground. The site shall be immediately filled and the surface cover replaced with hay and seed to dress up the right-of-way or other land. All persons performing stump removal on public lands shall be responsible for compliance with the Georgia Utility Facility Protection Act, O.C.G.A. § 25-9-1 et seq. 
(f)  Tree conservation and care during construction. Existing public trees and shrubs shall be conserved. A tree conservation plan shall be submitted for review and approval prior to any development of public lands to show that there will be no disturbance in the critical root zone (CRZ) of existing trees protected by this article. A disturbance is considered to include but not be limited to, trenching, placing, backfill in the CRZ, driving or parking equipment in the CRZ, and dumping of trash, oil, paint or other materials detrimental to plant health in the close proximity of the tree(s). Standards for identification of trees during development shall be as prescribed in the city development ordinance. Should any tree or shrub designated for conservation in the tree conservation plan die within two years of planting, the permit holder shall replace sufficient landscaping to meet the tree conservation plan. Replacement trees shall be a minimum of 2.5 inches in caliper for a shade tree and a minimum of eight feet in height for an ornamental tree (eight feet from the top of root ball to top of tree) at the time of planting. 
(Ord. No. 02-04, § 1(9), 3-12-2002) 
Sec. 98-40. - Hazardous trees. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of the owner of the property wherein or whereupon a public hazard exists due to dead or diseased trees or limbs thereof, obstruction of vision from vegetation at street intersections or driveways, or interference of vegetation with city utility structures, to abate the hazard by removing or trimming the offending vegetation. Should said owner, after due notice by the city using the best means of notice available, fail or refuse to remove or trim the offending tree or vegetation, the condition shall be deemed a public nuisance and abated by order of the municipal court pursuant to Chapter 42, Article II of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Griffin, Georgia. 
(b)  Trees on private property whose roots may damage sidewalks, curbs or public streets by causing them to buckle or crack, or whose roots may enter into public sewers or water mains, shall also be public hazards, which shall be deemed a public nuisance and abated by order of the municipal court pursuant to Chapter 42, Article II of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Griffin, Georgia.

ARTICLE II. - RETIREMENT BENEFITS 

Sec. 19A-2.1. - Generally. 
Participants' retirement benefits shall be determined under this article (subject to the limitations set forth in article III). Each participant shall be entitled to the nonforfeitable portion, as determined under section 19A-13.3 of his or her retirement benefit and shall have no right to any portion of his or her retirement benefit which is not nonforfeitable under section 19A-13.3 (nor shall any such portion increase the retirement benefit of any other participant). The form and timing of distribution of the nonforfeitable portion of a participant's retirement benefit shall be made in accordance with article IV. 
(Ord. No. 95-8, § 1, 6-13-1995) 
Sec. 19A-2.2. - Retirement benefit at or after normal retirement. 
For retirements occurring on or after January 1, 1973, an annual amount (although paid in monthly installments) equal to the greater of [subsection] (a) or (b) below, adjusted as described in (c), if necessary: 
(a)  One percent of average annual compensation not in excess of basic compensation, plus two percent of average annual compensation in excess of basic compensation, with the sum multiplied by the period of service. 
(b)  Five dollars and fifty cents multiplied by 12 and again multiplied by the period of service. 
(c)  If a participant attains his or her normal retirement date except that he or she has not made all of the employee contributions formerly required by this plan, such participant may nevertheless retire and receive his or her normal retirement benefit, but the amount is reduced in order to refund the deficient employee contributions as follows. the deficient contributions together with compound interest over a period of 60 equal monthly installments. However, if the form of payment of the normal retirement benefit is an optional form not including at least five certain years of payment, and the participant and beneficiary die before the 60 months of contributions are repaid, then neither the participant or the beneficiary is required to complete the refund. 
The benefits of employees who retired prior to January 1, 1973, shall be calculated and paid as if such retired employees had retired on January 1, 1973, with the same period of service and the same compensation which such formerly retired employees actually earned. Should benefits under this plan be increased in the future, such increase shall also inure to the benefit of then formerly retired employees. 
(Ord. No. 95-8, § 1, 6-13-1995) 
Sec. 19A-2.3. - Retirement benefit upon termination of employment before his or her normal retirement date. 
If a participant has a vested interest upon his or her termination of employment before his or her normal retirement date, the participant's retirement benefit shall be an amount equal to his or her retirement benefit under section 19A-2.2 as of the date of his or her termination of employment. 
For purposes of determining a participant's retirement benefit under this section 19A-2.3, it shall be assumed that payment of the retirement benefit under section 19A-2.2 will be made in the normal form of payment commencing on the first day of the month coincident with or next following the participant's 65th birthday. 
(Ord. No. 95-8, § 1, 6-13-1995) 
Sec. 19A-2.4. - Retirement benefit upon total disability. 
For a participant who became an employee before July 1, 1995, if such participant incurs a total disability following a five-year period of service, the participant's total disability benefit shall be an amount equal to the retirement benefit determined under section 19A-2.2 determined as of the date of his or her total disability. For a participant who becomes an employee on or after July 1, 1995, the participant's total disability benefit shall be zero. 
Payment of the participant's total disability benefit shall commence upon the first day of the month following the day the board of trustees determines the participant has incurred a total disability and shall cease upon the first day of the month following the earliest of (a) the determination of the board of trustees that the participant has recovered from total disability, or (b) the participant's death, subject to the form of payment chosen by the participant. Upon recovery from total disability, and provided the participant does not return to employment with the city, he or she shall be entitled to receive distribution of his or her retirement benefit as if the participant had a termination of employment on the day distribution of his or her total disability benefit commenced. 
As stated above, the board of trustees shall have discretion to grant disability benefits upon permanent total disability, in which case the monthly benefit is payable for the participant's remaining life, subject to elected form of payment. In addition, the board shall have discretion to grant, provide and suspend monthly disability benefits to participants upon temporary total disability. 
(Ord. No. 95-8, § 1, 6-13-1995) 
Sec. 19A-2.5. - Cost-of-living increases. 
On each January 1 and July 1, in addition to the monthly benefits calculated according to sections 19A-2.2, 19A-2.3, 19A-2.4 and 19A-5.2, each participant or beneficiary may also be entitled to receive a cost-of-living benefit adjustment. A participant's or beneficiary's entitlement to a cost of living benefit adjustment shall be determined by comparing a six-month average of the Consumer Price Index—U.S. All Cities (published by the United States Department of Labor) with the base index as that term is hereinafter defined. If the applicable consumer price index average is greater than the base index, the amount of difference up to a maximum of two percent of the participant's or beneficiary's gross retirement benefit shall be paid to him or her during the ensuing six months. A participant's or beneficiary's entitlement to receive benefits under this section 19A-2.5 shall be determined by the board of trustees as follows: 
(a)  The term "consumer priced index" shall mean (1) for calculations to be made as of January 1 of each year, the average of the monthly indices from May to October of the immediately preceding year of the Consumer Price Index—U.S. All Cities (published by the United States Department of Labor), and (2) for calculations required to be made as of July 1 of each year, the average of the monthly indices of the immediately preceding months of November through April of the Consumer Price Index—U.S. All Cities (published by the United States Department of Labor). 
(b)  The base index shall be the six-month average for the period immediately preceding the consumer price index period. 
(c)  The board shall determine the applicable average consumer price index and shall compare the same to the base index of each participant or beneficiary in pay status to form the individual C.P.I. ratio; provided, nevertheless, that the C.P.I. ratio may never be less than 1.00 nor more than 1.02. 
(d)  Each participant's or beneficiary's monthly benefit currently in pay status (whether retirement benefit, disability benefit, or death benefit) shall then be multiplied by the C.P.I. ratio determined according to paragraph [subsection] (c) above, and the product shall be the adjusted gross benefit for the ensuing six-month period. 
(e)  At each subsequent January 1 and July 1, a new adjusted gross benefit shall be determined for each participant or beneficiary receiving benefits by comparing the then most recent average consumer price index with the adjusted base index. A participant's or beneficiary's adjusted base index shall consist of his or her initial base index together with all increments, expressed as a percentage of increase, which have been previously added to his or her initial base index under this cost of living benefit adjustment. 
(f)  As to any participant or beneficiary who has not been receiving benefits for six months on a given adjustment date, the C.P.I. ratio will be adjusted pro rata for the period of payments received, giving credit for the month of initial payment if the benefits began on or before the 15th day of the month and not giving credit for the month of initial payment if the benefits began on or after the 16th day of the month. 
(Ord. No. 95-8, § 1, 6-13-1995) 
Sec. 19A-2.6. - Bonus adjustments. 
A bonus adjustment shall be paid from the surplus income of the aid fund, if any, as follows: 
(a)  As of January 1 of each year, the annual rate of earnings of all active participants shall be determined. 
(b)  The required new contribution shall be determined by multiplying this earnings amount by the contribution rate determined by the last actuarial valuation of the plan. 
(c)  As of January 1 of each year, the aid fund balance shall be determined. 
(d)  The required investment income shall then be determined by multiplying the aid fund balance by the actuarially assumed rate of income. 
(e)  As of the subsequent June 30, the total income to the aid fund for the previous year shall be determined. Total income includes contributions from all sources and all investment income less expenses incurred in collection or investment. 
(f)  Next, the board shall determine the available surplus by subtracting the sum of items [subsections] (b) and (d) from item [subsection] (e). 
(g)  Also, as of June 30, the pension reserve shall be determined for all participants in payment status. 
(h)  There shall then be allocated and paid, beginning on the next subsequent January 1, to each participant or beneficiary in payment status a bonus adjustment which shall be the lesser of (a) the benefit which one-half of the available surplus will fund, or (b) five percent of the participant's or beneficiary's benefit. 
(i)  For any participant or beneficiary who has not been receiving benefits for 12 months at the time the bonus adjustment is made, such individual's benefit shall be adjusted pro rata for the period giving credit for the month of initial payment if the benefits began on or before the 15th day of the month and not giving credit for the month of initial payment if the benefits began on or after the 16th day of the month. 
(Ord. No. 95-8, § 1, 6-13-1995) 
ARTICLE III. - LIMITATIONS ON BENEFITS 

Sec. 19A-3.1. - Definitions. 
The following definitions apply for purposes of section 19A-3.2: 
Annual benefit. A benefit which is payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity with no ancillary benefits and determined without regard to any contributions made by an employee. 
Defined benefit plan fraction. A fraction for any plan year. The numerator of the fraction is the participant's projected annual benefit. The denominator of the fraction is the lesser of (1) the product of 1.25 and $90,000.00 (or such higher amount as may be permitted under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code to reflect increases in the cost of living) and (2) the product of 1.4 and 100 percent of the participant's average compensation during the three consecutive limitation years in which the participant received the greatest amount of compensation. 
Defined contribution plan fraction. A fraction for any plan year. The numerator of the fraction is the aggregate amount of annual additions, as defined in section 415(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, to a participant's accounts as of the close of that plan year in all defined contribution plans (whether or not terminated). The denominator of the fraction is the aggregate amount described in the following sentence for all limitation years the participant was an employee (regardless of whether a defined contribution plan was in existence during those years). The amount for each such limitation year is equal to the lesser of (1) the product of 1.25 and the dollar amount under section 415(c)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code for that plan year and (2) the product of 1.4 and the amount determined under section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code for that plan year. In the case of a participant with respect to whom the sum of his or her defined benefit plan fraction and defined contribution plan fraction exceeds 1.0 as of either (or both) December 31, 1982 or December 31, 1986 (computed as if the provisions of section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 or the Tax Reform Act of 1986, respectively, were in effect on the applicable of those dates and disregarding any changes to the plans made after May 5, 1986, but using the section 415 limitation applicable to the first limitation year beginning on or after January 1, 1987) the numerator of the participant's defined contribution plan fraction shall be reduced so that the sum of those fractions as of the applicable date does not exceed 1.0. 
Projected annual benefit. The projected retirement benefit payable in the form of an annual benefit to which a participant would be entitled under all defined benefit plans assuming (a) that all relevant factors used to determine benefits under each of those plans remained constant from the last day of the most recent plan year in which the participant was credited with a year in his or her period of service until the participant's normal retirement date and (b) that distribution of those benefits commences on the participant's attainment of his or her normal retirement date (or current age if later). 
(Ord. No. 95-8, § 1, 6-13-1995) 
Sec. 19A-3.2. - Maximum retirement benefit. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this plan. 
(a)  Subject to subsections 19A-3.2(b), (c) and (d), the retirement benefit of a participant shall be reduced to the extent that it (plus, if applicable, the aggregate retirement benefit to which the participant is entitled under all other defined benefit plans in which he or she was a participant) exceeds the lesser of (1) $90,000.00 (or such higher amount as may be permitted under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code to reflect increases in the cost of living that occur on or after the participant's retirement, termination of employment, death or total disability) and (2) 100 percent of the participant's average compensation during the three consecutive limitation years in which the participant received the greatest amount of compensation. No reduction shall be required under this subsection 19A-3.2(a) in the case of a participant who never participated in a defined contribution plan if the participant's retirement benefit (plus, if applicable, the participant's retirement benefit under all other defined benefit plans) does not exceed $10,000.00. 
(b)  The following adjustments shall be made in applying the limitations of subsection 19A-3.2(a) and section 19A-3.3. 
(1)  If a participant's retirement benefit (or a retirement benefit to which the participant is entitled under any other defined benefit plan) is payable in a form other than an annual benefit, the retirement benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the actuarial equivalent of an annual benefit, except that any ancillary benefit that is not related to retirement income benefits shall not be taken into account. 
(2)  The dollar limitation set forth in subsection 19A-3.2(a)(1) shall be adjusted as set forth below: 
(i)  If distribution of a participant's retirement benefit begins before the participant's attainment of age 62, then the limitation shall be reduced in accordance with regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Treasury consistent with reduction for old age benefits commencing before social security retirement age under the Social Security Act so that it equals the amount of an annual benefit beginning at the time distribution of the participant's retirement benefit begins, which is the actuarial equivalent of an annual benefit equal to the dollar limitation set forth in subsection 19A-3.2(a)(1) beginning at the participant's attainment of age 62, except that the limitation shall not be reduced to less than an annual benefit which is the actuarial equivalent of an annual benefit of $75,000.00 beginning at age 55. 
(ii)  If distribution of a participant's retirement benefit begins after the participant's social security retirement age, the limitation shall be increased (in accordance with regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Treasury) so that it equals the amount of an annual benefit beginning at the time distribution of the participant's retirement benefit begins, which is the actuarial equivalent of an annual benefit equal to the dollar limitation set forth in subsection 19A-3.2(a)(1) beginning at the participant's social security retirement age. 
(3)  In the case of a participant with less than ten years of participation in the plan or less than ten years in the period of service.

(4)  For purposes of adjusting the participant's retirement benefit under subsection 19A-3.2(b)(1) or the dollar limitation under subsection 19A-3.2(b)(2), the interest rate assumption shall be the rate set forth in section 19A-1.1 of this plan, subject to the limitations on interest rates of section 415(b)(2)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code.

ARTICLE IV. - DISTRIBUTION 

Sec. 19A-4.1. - Election of form of distribution. 
A participant shall be entitled to elect to receive distribution of his or her retirement benefit or total disability benefit by one of the following methods. If any option is chosen other than the normal form of payment, then the monthly benefit shall be adjusted to the actuarial equivalent amount under the chosen option. 
(a)  Life annuity with a period certain feature. An annuity for the life of the participant, but if the participant dies within a predetermined number of years of his or her annuity starting date, (e.g., 5, 10 or 15 years, etc.) the annuity is payable to the participant's beneficiary for the remainder of that certain period. 
(b)  Joint and survivor annuity. An annuity for the life of the participant with a survivor annuity for the life of the participant's beneficiary, where the survivor annuity is a predetermined percentage (e.g., 50 percent, 75 percent, 100 percent, etc.) of the amount payable during the joint lives of the participant and the participant's beneficiary. 
(c)  Social Security option. An increased plan benefit payable to the participant during his or her lifetime until his or her retirement benefits commence under the Federal Social Security Act, and a reduced plan benefit payable thereafter for life, in order to provide a more level retirement income when such reduced plan benefit is added to the participant's primary benefits under the Federal Social Security Act. The exact amount of the plan benefit shall be based upon estimated primary benefits under the Federal Social Security Act determined as of the participant's early retirement date. 
A participant's election under this section 19A-4.1 (which includes the designation of a contingent beneficiary) must be made in such form and manner as set forth by the board of trustees. This election may not be changed after the participant's annuity starting date. 
In the absence of an effective election under this section 19A-4.1, a participant shall be deemed to have elected a distribution in the normal form of payment. Notwithstanding any provision of subsection 19A-3.1 to the contrary, any option which provides a joint and survivor form of retirement benefit or disability benefit which includes a joint pensioner who is not the spouse of the participant will not be available hereunder unless the actuarial value of the benefits expected to be paid under such option to the participant during the remainder of his or her lifetime is at least equal to 50 percent of the actuarial value of the benefits which would be payable under the plan in the absence of such option; and further provided that if any option is a monthly benefit other than a joint and survivor form of retirement or disability benefit, such option will not be available to a participant if the monthly benefit payable to the participant under such option is less than the monthly benefit payable under a payments certain and life thereafter option for the earlier of 20 years or to age 85.

b.  His or her dependent minor child at the time of his or her death, then the preretirement death benefit is as described in (i) or (ii) below, whichever has the largest actuarial value at the time of the participant's death: 
i.  The survivor's portion of the actuarial equivalent 50 percent joint and survivor annuity (as described in section 19A-4.1, but modified to pay the survivor's portion to the dependent minor child until the earlier of the child's death or attainment of age 18), or 
ii.  The beneficiary's portion of the normal form of payment (i.e., five years of benefits). 
c.  Not his or her spouse dependent minor child at the time of his or her death, then the preretirement death benefit is the beneficiary's portion of the normal form of payment (i.e. five years of benefits). 
d.  Alternatively, the designated beneficiary (or the guardian in the case of a dependent minor child) may choose to have the preretirement death benefit paid to him or her in an actuarial equivalent single-sum payment. 
e.  If the actuarial present value of the pretreatment death benefit is less than $5,000.00 as of the participant's date of death, the board of trustees may direct that the benefit be paid to the designated beneficiary in an actuarial equivalent single-sum payment as soon as administratively practicable following the participant's death.

However, the preretirement death benefit shall be actuarially reduced to reflect payments made prior to the earlier of (a) the date that would have been the participant's normal retirement date, or (b) the date that would have been the participant's 65th birthday, had the participant survived. 
If the preretirement death benefit is the five years of payment, then the beneficiary's annuity starting date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the participant's death. 
If the beneficiary chooses the lump sum form of payment in lieu of the annuities, then the preretirement death benefit single-sum equivalent will be paid to the beneficiary on the first day of the month coincident with or next following the participant's death.

The director of planning and development services is hereby authorized to establish administrative deadlines for the receipt of applications and associated information in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
401 A. - No application officially accepted until complete. 
1.  Review of application completeness. Upon submittal, each application shall be subjected to a review of application completeness prior to being officially accepted by the city. An application shall be considered "complete" if it is submitted on the required form, includes all submittal information, including all exhibits specified by the director, and accompanied by the application processing fee as adopted by the board of commissioners and as may be revised periodically. The review of application completeness shall be conducted by staff within five business days of the submittal deadline. If the city determines the application is complete, the application shall be processed pursuant to this chapter. 
2.  Incomplete applications. If the city determines that the application is incomplete, staff shall notify the applicant of that fact via the contact phone information provided and specify the ways in which the application is deficient. All incomplete applications shall receive no further processing until the deficiencies are corrected via a new submittal. 
3.  Resubmittal of applications. Resubmittal of the application shall be treated as a new application. Under no circumstances may staff delay conducting the review of application completeness in excess of five business days of the submittal deadline. If the review of application completeness is not completed within five business days of the submittal deadline, the application shall be determined complete. 
401 B. - Submittal fees. 
All applications shall be submitted with the required fee. The amount of each fee will be established by the city, and approved by the board of commissioners, which may be revised periodically. 
401 C. - Boundary survey. 
All applications shall be accompanied by a boundary survey prepared by a registered land surveyor; the number of copies shall be submitted as indicated on application forms established by the city; applications shall also include one copy of the boundary survey reduced to a size of 8.5 inches by 11 inches. 
401 D. - Legal description. 
All applications shall be accompanied by a written metes and bounds legal description. It must establish a point of beginning and from the point of beginning give each dimension bounding the property, calling the directions (e.g. north, northeasterly, southerly, etc.) which the boundary follows around the property returning to the point of beginning. If there are multiple properties, all properties shall be combined into one legal description. 
401 E. - Non-discrimination. 
1.  Purpose and intent. Throughout this Code, provisions are made for the issuance by the city of various licenses, permits, and approvals. Some are required by federal or state law while others are part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme adopted by this board of commissioners. The commission finds that the number of ever-increasing demands on city staff, resources, and infrastructure is limited, not only by budgetary constraints, but physical limitations and manpower. It is the objective of this commission to utilize its resources wisely, fairly, and in the most efficient manner, while requiring consideration of criteria and standards without discrimination or favor. The intent of this section is to recognize and provide guidance for city staff and this commission as the city's governing authority to ensure that city services, privileges, and benefits are delivered in a non-discriminatory manner. 
Most all forms of licenses, permits, and approvals required by the city involve some form of deployment of city resources. In order to conserve and allocate these resources wisely, the city often must balance competing factors affecting its citizens, property owners, residents and businesses. Licensing and permitting often requires some form of due process, or notice, and can only be approved following a hearing or other means of allowing citizens to be heard. Adequate advance notice to the pertinent city staff is key to timely and relevant decision-making, as well as a full understanding of material facts and the applicant's objectives. Normally, the burden is on the applicant to apprise the city staff of material information by filing a complete application. 
Fees charged in relation to permits or licenses are established to recoup the city's cost of permit/license review and administration. In certain cases, the fee will also seek to recoup anticipated costs to the city for the burden placed on infrastructure and services, such as additional security and traffic control. The upfront payment of required fees is part of the submission of a complete application. Waiver or reduction of fees and waiver of a complete written application is discouraged, except as incentives for economic development, and should only be approved by the city manager, upon written recommendation of a department manager. 
Last, while it is the general intent of this commission to make its permitting and licensing procedures as simplified as possible, the need for fully informed decision-making by city staff and this commission mandates the need for consistency and transparency, which are only attainable through a written application process, followed by documented verification and review. In all instances where applications are filed, the city will seek to provide a timely response to the applicant, with all final decisions (approval, denial, or approval upon reasonable conditions) given to the applicant in writing. 
2.  Non-discrimination. This provision shall apply to all licensing, permitting, and/or approval requests found in this Code. Though certain Code sections may contain objective criteria or standards relevant to the specific license, permit, or approval sought, this provision shall serve as an overlay and guide the decision-making process. 
a.  No license, permit, or approval shall be denied nor shall the applicant be given less favorable treatment as to time, place, or manner requirements or conditions on account of the race, color, creed, religion, gender, domestic relationship status, familial status, sexual orientation, national origin, political affiliation, or gender identity of the applicant and/or participants in the business, undertaking, event, or activity to be carried out by the applicant under such license, permit, or approval. 
b.  No license, permit, or approval shall be denied nor shall the applicant be given less favorable treatment as to time, place, or manner requirements or conditions based upon the message or content of speech of the applicant and/or participants in the business, undertaking, event, or activity to be carried out by the applicant under such license, permit, or approval. 
c.  Where it is assumed or reasonably believed that issuance of a license, permit, or approval is likely to result in unreasonable hostility by opponents of an applicant and/or its group or entity, or there is a heighten risk to public safety, based upon the content of speech or the message conveyed by the applicant and/or participants in the undertaking, event, or activity to be carried out by the applicant under such license, permit, or approval, reasonable accommodation as to time, place, and manner requirements shall be afforded, including provision of city resources necessary for traffic control, and police and fire protection; provided, however, payment for or reimbursement of the cost of such accommodation may be imposed by the city as a reasonable condition for such approval. 
d.  All other conditions or modifications of the time, place, and manner requirements for a license, permit, or approval shall be reasonable and imposed based upon compelling reasons relating to public safety, health, or the environment. When approval is based upon the imposition of reasonable conditions, all such conditions shall be clearly set forth in the written notice of decision.

2.  The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; 
3.  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; 
4.  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of these regulations, provided, however, that no variance may be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this ordinance; and

A legal non-conforming structure may be maintained, repaired or structurally altered, under permit, in accordance with all pertinent building codes and ordinances. Failure to maintain a non-conforming structure in minimal compliance with applicable codes and ordinances, such that the general condition of the structure constitutes dilapidation or significant disrepair, shall create a rebuttable presumption of the owner or occupier's intent to abandon the non-conforming structure.

For purposes of this ordinance, discontinuance of the use for a period of one year or more shall create a rebuttable presumption of the owner or occupier's intent to abandon the non-conforming use. A legal, non-conforming use may not be enlarged or expanded to a less restrictive use (i.e. residential to commercial) unless a special use permit is issued in accordance with Article 4 of this ordinance. 
505 C. 
Discontinuance of a legal non-conforming use or structure following its destruction by fire or other natural hazard shall not evidence intent to abandon if the owner applies for a permit to rebuild the structure or otherwise reactivate the use, within six months of the occurrence; provided, however, this period may be extended for an additional six months, but not to exceed a total of one year from the date of the occurrence, if the owner demonstrates substantial progress, time, effort and money in renovation of the structure. 
505 D. 
It shall be the objective of the city that whenever feasible, legal non-conforming uses and structures be rendered conforming through the issuance of special use permits in accordance with Section 406. Conditions imposed on such permits shall be designed to ameliorate the impact of the use or structure on adjacent or nearby properties and uses permitted by the zoning classification. 
505 E. 
Where the zoning administrator determines a use or structure was rendered non-conforming by the adoption of this ordinance or any amendment thereto, he or she shall notify the property owner, in writing, that the use or structure constitutes a legal non-conforming use or legal non-conforming structure and inform the owner of the consequences of the abandonment of such use or structure under the provisions of this ordinance. An owner may appeal the determination of the zoning administrator to the board of commissioners. 
505 F. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance, any existing non-conforming use or structure which was illegal under any prior zoning ordinance shall continue to be an illegal non-conforming use or structure under this ordinance unless the use or structure is expressly permitted by this ordinance and meets all criteria for a permitted use or structure within its assigned zoning classification.

"Enclosed floor area" does not include garages, basements or porches, whether unenclosed or enclosed by screen. 
3.  Design standards. The following design standards shall control construction regulated by this section: 
a.  Architectural style. Notwithstanding other provisions of this ordinance regulating lot size, lot width, yard setbacks or other development standards, residential in-fill development shall conform to the maximum extent practicable with existing residential development in the neighborhood. Such conformance shall include but not be limited to, adherence to existing architectural style, as much as practicable, building height and scale, roof pitch, siding materials, dwelling size and setbacks. 
b.  Maximum floor area. The maximum enclosed floor area of any building regulated by this section shall not exceed 200 percent of either (a) the minimum floor area of the zoning district in which the lot is located, as indicated in Table 1 below, or (b) the average enclosed floor area of all single family detached dwellings on the same street as the proposed building within 400 linear feet of the nearest corner of such lot, in both directions, based upon floor areas as they exist on the date of adoption of this article. The maximum enclosed floor area for corner lots shall be determined as stated above, except that the average enclosed floor area of all single family detached dwellings on both streets as the proposed building shall be used. For purposes of this subsection, applicants need only comply with one of the foregoing options. For additions, this limitation shall apply to the entire building based on the sum of the amount of existing square footage and the amount of proposed additional square footage. 
c.  Minimum floor area . The minimum enclosed floor area of a dwelling shall not be less than 750 square feet. 

 
d.  Building height. Maximum building height shall not exceed 30 feet and shall be subject to the further provisions of this section. Building height shall be the highest point along a roof or highest ridgeline, as measured from the average, natural, undisturbed, adjacent grade as it exists on the date of enactment of this ordinance. 
e.  Consistent building setbacks. On building lots for which the front yard setback of single family detached dwellings on the two adjoining lots on the same block face is less than that required for that zoning district, the average setback of the four adjoining dwellings on the same block face shall be used to determine the minimum setback applicable to the lot proposed for development. In no case shall the front yard setback be less than ten feet as measured from the front property boundary. 
f.  Roof pitch. Minimum roof pitch shall be consistent with the roof pitch of single family detached dwellings on the same street as the proposed building within 400 linear feet of the nearest corner of such lot, in both directions. Any building to be built on a corner lot must be consistent with single family detached dwellings on both streets of the proposed building. 
g.  Building materials. Siding materials shall be natural wood or an approved masonry product, as long as such product does not destroy the design standards of the neighborhood. Cementitious siding (such as "Hardiplank") may be used to replace wood or asbestos panel siding. Pre-fabricated metal buildings, synthetic stucco, "dryvit", exterior insulation and finish systems, vinyl siding and other materials found to be other than durable products are specifically prohibited. 
h.  Application. Applicants proposing development regulated under this section shall submit a site plan, architectural plans or other documentation sufficient for illustrating the architectural style, exterior finishing materials, enclosed floor area, building height, building setback and roof pitch of the proposed construction and all appropriate certifications required by this section. 
i.  Review process. All applications shall be subject to review as outlined in Article 4 Submittal Requirements for all Building, Development and Zoning Applicants. 
j.  Zoning conflicts. Whenever the provisions of this section require development which would exceed building standards for the zoning district in which the lot is located, and such increased building standards cannot be accommodated while maintaining yard or setback requirements under applicable district standards, the requirements of this section shall be followed only to the maximum extent possible in conformity with applicable yard or setback requirements unless such yard or setback requirements are reduced by the grant of a variance. 
k.  Reconstruction of damaged buildings. The rebuilding of a building damaged by fire, wind, flooding or other causes may be accomplished to the same specifications as the original building without regard to any limitations imposed by this section, as long as such reconstruction does not violate local zoning laws. 
4.  Whenever the provisions of this section require construction on a lot that renders conformance to the side yard impractical, the requirements of this section governing the size of the structure and compatibility of the structure shall control. 
605 C. - In-fill administrative variances: authority of the zoning administrator. 
The authority of the zoning administrator to exercise administrative discretion in application of the zoning ordinance to encourage residential infill to foster construction on undeveloped, non-conforming lots shall be as follows:

720 E. - Amenity bonuses. 
1.  Special amenity bonuses. Special amenity bonuses for increased density are intended to provide incentives to improve the livability of multiple-family developments for their residents and to promote family oriented multiple-family developments. The amenity bonuses are designed to allow additional dwelling units in a manner that is still consistent with the purposes of the multiple family zones. 
The bonuses are applicable to a range of development sizes. However, they may be more practical, feasible or workable for large projects. Not all bonus options will be applicable for all situations. The amenity options are designed to provide incentives, while leaving the specific choices to the developer. 
The amount of the bonus for each option is a result of balancing several factors including: 
a.  The likelihood that the amenity will be provided without the use of incentives; 
b.  The potential cost to the developer; 
c.  The importance of the amenity. 
2.  Regulations. 
a.  Qualifying types of development. The amenity bonus provisions are applicable to multi-dwelling and condominium apartment developments in a SHROD. 
b.  Computation of the bonus. The percentages of all bonus options included in the development project are added together. The total is then applied to the allowed number of dwelling units to determine the additional units allowed. Fractions of additional units earned are not counted. 
c.  Maximum bonus. The maximum density increase allowed for a development is 12 percent. 
d.  Compliance with the standards. The amenity bonus standards must be met in full to receive the bonus; exceptions are prohibited. In addition, adjustments to the development standards of the base zone or overlay district are prohibited if the project is to receive any density bonus. It is the responsibility of the applicant to document that all of the amenity bonus requirements are met. 
e.  Base zone development standards. The additional dwelling units must comply with all applicable development standards. 
f.  Covenants. The entire SHROD development shall be included within private deed covenants running with the land to assure the continuance of the SHROD in accordance with approved plans and development. The city attorney must approve the covenant as to form. The covenant must be recorded prior to issuance of building permits for the project. 
3.  Amenity bonus options. 
a.  Indoor and outdoor recreational facilities. Indoor recreational facilities may include gym, spa, racquetball courts, and other indoor recreational facilities. Outdoor recreational facilities may include such facilities as tennis, basketball or volleyball courts, ball field, swimming pool, horseshoe pit, running or walking trail, gazebo with permanent picnic tables and barbecue pit and similar facilities. The density bonus is one percent for each $5,000.00 of the overall project cost spent on outdoor recreational facilities. There is a maximum of a five percent density increase allowed for this bonus option. 
b.  Children's play areas. The density bonus for this amenity is two and one-half percent. A qualifying children's play area must comply with all of the following standards: 
i.  Size and location. Each child's play area must be at least 1,000 square feet and clearly delineated. Children's play areas must be separated from any other outdoor recreational facilities. 
ii.  Play equipment. Each children's play area must include a play structure at least 100 square feet in area, a swing structure with a minimum of four swings, and at least one of the following: a slide, permanent sandbox, permanent wading pool or other children's play equipment commonly found in a public park. Equipment must be constructed of adequate materials to comply with safety standards and to match expected use. 
iii.  Fencing. Each child's play area must be fenced along any perimeter that is within 20 feet of a street, alley, property line, driveway, service or parking area. The fence shall be any type of chain link. 
c.  Storage areas. The density bonus for this amenity is seven percent. The bonus is allowed if all dwelling units are provided with interior storage, including but not limited to shelve and drawer space in the kitchen, bedroom closets in each bedroom, linen closet in hallway or bathroom and entry closet; and additional storage for large items, including but not limited to areas that are dry and have locks for items such as barbecues, bicycles, storage boxes and sports equipment.

722. - MIXED USE/TOD OVERLAY DISTRICT. 
722 A. - General provisions. 
1.  Scope of regulations. This ordinance establishes standards and procedures that apply to any development, use, alteration, height, parking, open space, public space and building that lies, in whole or in part, within the Mixed Use/TOD Overlay District, hereinafter referred to as the Griffin Overlay District. The Griffin Overlay District is based upon the urban design and development guidelines included in the Downtown Griffin Livable Centers Initiative (LCI) plan, Griffin LCI Area Design Guidelines, as well as other associated plans. The plans call for a community that incorporates higher design standards in the downtown Griffin area and near the proposed commuter rail station while providing a mix of commercial, office, recreation, and housing options. 
Wherever the underlying zoning regulations are in conflict with the provisions of this overlay district, the regulations of this overlay district shall apply. 
2.  Statement of purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of the board of commissioners in establishing the Griffin Overlay District is as follows: 
a.  To promote the development of a more dynamic, mixed-use district of appropriate scale and magnitude in the downtown Griffin area; 
b.  To design and arrange structures, buildings, streets, and open spaces to create an inviting, walkable, human-scale environment as well as active ground floor commercial spaces; 
c.  To ensure a proportional relationship of surrounding buildings with respect to the general spacing of structures, building mass and scale, and street frontage by using techniques to achieve compatibility; 
d.  To provide for connectivity of streets and communities and reduce the dependence on automobile use by increasing the ease of movement and opportunities for alternative modes of travel; 
e.  To promote the preservation of historic structures that reflect the history, character and architecture of the City of Griffin; 
f.  To provide property owners, builders and developers with a clear description of criteria used to review and evaluate the project; 
g.  To reclaim industrial land; and 
h.  To implement the policies and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan and other adopted planning documents within the Griffin Overlay District. 
3.  Applicability of regulations. This ordinance applies to each application for a business license, land-disturbance permit, building permit or sign permit which involves the development, use, alteration, or modification of any structure or land where the subject property is located in whole, or in part, within the boundaries of the Griffin Overlay District. The procedures, standards, and criteria apply only to that portion of the subject property within the boundaries of the Griffin Overlay District. This ordinance contains regulations for new construction, existing building renovation and rehabilitation and public improvements to encourage the orderly development within and along the edges of the central business district and the future commuter rail station. 
The ordinance divides development into two types, new construction and existing buildings. Depending upon the project scope and existing building status and condition, new construction standards may apply to an existing building. Design review and a certificate of compliance are required for all development. 
a.  Design review and a certificate of compliance by the planning and development services department are required for all new construction, existing building renovation or rehabilitation within the Griffin Overlay District. Plan submittal is required for buildings built on vacant lots after adoption or for the replacement of demolished buildings as well as any exterior rehabilitation or renovation. 
i.  Exceptions: 
The planning and development service department director can deem the project a minor application which requires more limited submittals from those outlined in Section 721 B., which will be determined on case by case basis. 
(a)  "Minor Modifications" are small deviations from otherwise applicable standards of this ordinance that may be approved by the planning and development services director without being required to apply for conceptual and final plan submittal. Minor modifications are to be used when the limited nature of the modification requested, and the unlikelihood of any adverse effects on nearby properties or the neighborhood, make it unnecessary to complete a formal process. 
1.  Applicability: The planning and development services director may approve a minor modification of up to a maximum of ten percent from only numeric development standard in this ordinance provided that the intent of this ordinance is met. At no time shall the planning and development services director approve a minor modification that results in the following: 
a.  An increase in the overall project intensity, density, or impervious cover; 
b.  Change in permitted uses; or 
c.  Design compatibility, based on this ordinance, is compromised. 
(b)  Routine maintenance does not require design review or a certificate of compliance. 
b.  Structures: The City of Griffin has a vast array of contributing historic structures that should be preserved and possibly adaptively re-used if their original use is no longer practical. The following criteria should be used by staff to determine if a structure is contributing or non-contributing. It also establishes the sections of the code that should be used for each type of structure 
i.  Contributing Structures: 
a.  The building adds to the historical or architectural qualities of the overlay; 
b.  The building retains its physical integrity; 
c.  The building is 50 years old or older; 
d.  If a building is 50 years old or older and considered contributing, development must comply with Section 722 L., Existing Buildings. 
ii.  Non-contributing Structures: 
a.  The building does not add to the historical or architectural qualities of the overlay; 
b.  The building has had inappropriate and irreversible alterations or additions; 
c.  Existing Buildings which are less than 50 years old and possess no distinguishing architectural features, are hereby determined to be non-contributing, and may be maintained, demolished or renovated. If a building of this type replaced with a new building or undergoes a substantial rehabilitation, it must comply with Sections 722 D—K. 
iii.  Demolition: Design review by the City Staff is required if the building is 50 years or older. Staff shall determine whether or not the building is contributing or non-contributing when determining the approval or denial of a request for demolition in accordance with the criteria established above. Contributing buildings shall be retained unless the applicant can provide a condition report and structural letter from a licensed building inspector or engineer who determines the building unsalvageable. The City Staff may call on the building official to provide them with a report on the state of the repair and structural stability of the structure under consideration. Request for demolition must be accompanied by a plan for the replacement of the building. 
4.  District boundaries and map. 
a.  The boundaries and development categories of the Griffin Overlay District are described below and shall be established by a zoning map amendment adopted pursuant to this ordinance which shall be incorporated herein and made a part of this ordinance (Figure 1, Overlay District Map). 
b.  Street Classification: Additional parcels outside downtown Griffin may achieve the Mixed Use Overlay district designation by application, according to procedures for zoning map amendments (rezoning). Applications must identify which Tier and Street Classification type most appropriately provides for the context of the proposed development. 
i.  Primary Streets: Hill Street from Overlay boundary to Chappell Street, Broad Street, Broadway Street; 
ii.  Secondary Streets: All other. 
c.  The Griffin Overlay District shall be divided into three development categories: 
i.  Neighborhood tier. The intent of the neighborhood tier is to preserve the residential traditional neighborhood character, historic structures and uses while allowing office adaptive re-use for structures along a primary streets and mixed use, and commercial uses along the primary streets where the property is vacant or currently utilized for commercial purposes within the district. This neighborhood character shall be guided by residential architecture such as pitched roofs, smaller scale, fenestration, cornices, columns and other architectural features. The height in this district shall be compatible to residential structures. 
(a)  Tier summary. The Neighborhood tier summary is provided in Figure 722.1. All development shall conform to the dimensions, design, and other standards identified within Figure 722.1. Where text differs from the figure, the text shall control. 
ii.  Village tier. The intent of the village tier is to revitalize the downtown core in conjunction with the Historic District and create a well defined, integrated core area for the downtown Griffin area. Vertical mixed use type development with commercial, residential, and office uses is encouraged to help enhance the downtown character. The urban character of this district shall be guided by zero setbacks, urban design features, preservation of historic building and compatible massing, scale and architectural detailing. 
(a)  Tier summary. The Village tier summary is provided in Figure 722.2. All development shall conform to the dimensions, design, and other standards identified within Figure 722.2. Where text differs from the figure, the text shall control. 
iii.  Corridor tier. The intent of the corridor tier is to encourage mixed use type development that creates a more aesthetically pleasing and pedestrian friendly environment. Commercial, office, residential, multi-family, vertical mixed use type developments are desired. The orientation of any development shall be toward the street, focused on the primary street (if one exists) and the secondary if no primary street exists; however access can be from the rear and historic structures shall be preserved. 
(a)  Tier summary. The Corridor tier summary is provided in Figure 722.3. All development shall conform to the dimensions, design, and other standards identified within Figure 722.3. Where text differs from the figure, the text shall control. 
d.  The planning and development services director shall have the final authority to determine whether any property is located within the boundaries of the Griffin Overlay District and which tier the subject property falls under.

723. - CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION ZONING OVERLAY DISTRICT. 
723 A. - Background. 
Open space development has numerous environmental and community benefits, including: 
1.  Reduces the impervious cover in a development. Impervious cover contributes to degradation of water resources by increasing the volume of surface runoff, and preventing infiltration of rainfall into the soil surface. 
2.  Reduces pollutant loads to streams and other water resources. 
3.  Reduces potential pressure to encroach on resource buffer areas. 
4.  Reduces soil erosion potential by reducing the amount of clearing and grading on the site. 
5.  Preserves green space. 
6.  Preserves open space for recreation. 
7.  Reduces the capital cost of development. 
8.  Reduces the cost of stormwater management by concentrating runoff in one area and reducing runoff volumes. 
9.  Provides a wider range of feasible sites to locate stormwater BMPs. 
10.  Reduces the cost of future public services needed by the development. 
11.  Can increase future property values. 
12.  Creates urban wildlife habitat "islands." 
13.  Creates a sense of community and pedestrian movement. 
14.  Can support other community planning goals, such as farmland preservation, affordable housing, and architectural diversity. 
723 B. - Purposes. 
The purpose this zoning district is to protect natural, historic and community resources within the City of Griffin by promoting open space development within our jurisdictions. It also aims to serve as a tool for water quality and watershed protection and to enhance the visual and esthetic value of land in the City of Griffin by providing for and promoting the development of residential subdivisions that conserve open space and integrate natural features into site design. Specifically, the district intends: 
1.  To provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure. 
2.  To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land. 
3.  To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat. 
4.  To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development. 
5.  To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development. 
6.  To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community. 
7.  To promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions. 
8.  To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood. 
9.  To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries. 
10.  To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles. 
11.  To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space. 
12.  To preserve important historic and archaeological sites.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 15-15, § 1, adopted Oct. 27, 2015 , repealed the former Art. 12, §§ 1201—1222, and enacted a new Art. 12 as set out herein. The former Art. 12 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 12-12, adopted March 13, 2012 ; Ord. No. 13-05, § 1, adopted May 14, 2013 ; Ord. No. 15-04, § 1, adopted April 28, 2015 ; Ord. No. 15-09, § 1, adopted July 13, 2015 . 

1201. - FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
1201 A. 
The City of Griffin finds that signs are a proper use of private property, are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment. As such, signs are entitled to the protection of the law. In the absence of regulation, however, the number of signs tends to proliferate, with property owners desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares. In addition, the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises. 
1201 B. 
Regulation of the size, height, number, and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety, to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses, to enhance the business and economy of the city, to protect the public investment in the streets and highways, to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas, to promote industry and commerce, to eliminate visual clutter and blight, to provide an aesthetically appealing environment, and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the city's citizens. To the extent regulation of signs affects speech protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Art. 1, Sec. 1, Par. 5 of the 1983 Constitution of Georgia, the regulation should be content-neutral on its face; otherwise, the need to regulate must be justified by a compelling government interest and narrowly tailored to be the least intrusive imposition on free speech. 
1201 C. 
The city further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses. Signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected on public rights-of-way for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or through provision of such type signage as street signs or wayfinding signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going. As such, with the exception of signs identifying government buildings, virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public.

Appeal notices received less than five business days prior to a scheduled commission meeting shall be heard at the next available meeting more than five business days following receipt of appeal. The board of commissioners shall issue a written decision to the applicant no later than 30 calendar days following the close of the appeal hearing. Decisions of the board of commissioners to affirm the decision of the building official or to overrule the decision of the building official and grant or continue the permit for which appeal is taken shall be reduced to writing and served upon the applicant in the same manner as the original notice to deny or notice of revocation.

( Ord. No. 15-15, § 1, 10-27-2015 ) 
1221. - REMOVAL PROCEDURE. 
1221 A. 
The building official shall cause to be removed any sign that he determines endangers the public safety, such as an abandoned, dangerous, or electrically or structurally defective sign or a sign for which no permit has been issued or which is otherwise in violation of this article. The building official shall prepare a written notice that shall describe the sign and specify the violation involved. The notice shall state that if the sign is not removed or the violation is not corrected within 20 calendar days, the sign shall be removed in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
1221 B. 
All notices by the building official shall be personally served or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested. Any time periods provided in this section shall be deemed to commence on the date of service as contemplated by O.C.G.A. § 9-11-4. 
1221 C. 
The notice shall be mailed to the owner of the property on which the sign is located, the owner of the sign, if known, and the occupant of the property, if any. If any such person is unknown or cannot be found, notice shall be mailed to such person's last known address, if any, and posted on the sign or on the premises. 
1221 D. 
Any person having a financial interest in the sign or the property may appeal the determination of the building official ordering removal or compliance by filing a written notice of appeal with the board of commissioners within 20 calendar days after receipt of the notice. Appeals will be handled as provided in Section 1206. 
1221 E. 
If the person to whom notice is directed pursuant to subsection (b) above fails to take corrective action within the time period prescribed, or if on appeal the board of commissioners affirms the decision of the building official and the person fails to take corrective action or remove the offending sign within the time period prescribed, then the building official shall proceed to have the sign removed or corrected to bring such sign into compliance with this article or to remove any unsafe condition. 
1221 F. 
When it is determined by the building official that the sign would cause imminent danger to the public safety and contact cannot be made with the sign owner or building owner, no written notice shall have to be served prior to removal. In such emergency situation, the building official shall document the unsafe condition and may correct the danger, with all costs being charged to the sign owner or the property owner. 
1221 G. 
If it shall be necessary for the building official to remove the sign pursuant to the provisions of this section, and it should be practicable to sell or salvage any material derived in the removal, the building official may sell or salvage any material derived in the removal. He may sell the same at public or private sale at the best price obtainable and keep an account of the proceeds thereof. Such proceeds, if any, shall be used to offset the cost of removal to be charged to the sign owner or property owner. Any proceeds in excess of the cost of removal shall be returned to the sign owner, if known, or if unknown, shall be deposited in the city treasury and maintained for benefit of the owner for a period of three years. At the end of three years, all unclaimed proceeds shall become the property the city. Where the proceeds derived from such sale are less than the costs of removal, such deficiency shall constitute a lien against the property on which the sign is located. Such lien shall be collectable in the same manner as city property taxes. 
1221 H. 
Any sign removed by the building official pursuant to the provisions of this section shall become the property of the city and may be disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate by the city. The cost of removal of the sign by the city shall constitute a lien against the property and shall be recoverable in the same manner as city property taxes.

( Ord. No. 15-15, § 1, 10-27-2015 ) 
1222. - VARIANCES. 
1222 A. 
Variances from the regulations of this article shall be limited to the following hardship situations: 
1.  Where the proximity of existing signs on adjoining lots causes the subject property to be ineligible, due to spacing requirements, for a sign of the type sought; or 
2.  Where visibility of a conforming sign from the proposed street and within 50 feet of the proposed sign would be substantially impaired by existing trees, plants, natural features, signs, buildings or structures on a different lot; and 
a.  Placement of the sign elsewhere on the lot would not remedy the visual obstruction; 
b.  Such visibility obstruction was not created by the owner of the subject property; and 
c.  The variance proposed would not create a safety hazard to vehicular traffic or pedestrians. 
1222 B. 
Variances shall be limited to the minimum relief necessary to overcome the hardship. No variances shall be granted to allow a greater number of signs than would be allowed if the hardship did not exist. 
1222 C. 
Relief from the application of the provisions of this article by use of variances granted by the board of commissioners shall be granted only upon a finding of hardship as previously defined. Hearing on such variances shall be noticed using this same time frames and notice requirements as for variances from zoning decisions. 
( Ord. No. 15-15, § 1, 10-27-2015 ) 
ARTICLE 13. - THE SUBDIVISION AND SITE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS 

1301. - MANAGEMENT OF LAND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS: OVERVIEW. 
This chapter is designed to set forth the process that applicants need to follow in order to gain approval of subdivision plans and site development plans and pursue construction of land improvements on a parcel of land in the City of Griffin. 
The department of development services, department of water/wastewater, department of public works and the department of stormwater share a similar organizational structure and mission. These departments are responsible for various aspects of the site and subdivision review, approval and land permitting process. In general, the department of development services is responsible for application intake; project tracking; plan review coordination; plan review for consistency with the zoning ordinance; plan review for consistency with the non-engineering aspects of these development regulations; plan approval; construction site inspection of land improvements; construction bond and escrow management; and land permit issuance. The department of public works/stormwater is responsible for plan review for consistency with the engineering/technical aspects of stormwater and streets; and field support for bond/escrow actions. The department of water/wastewater is responsible for plan review for consistency with the engineering/technical aspects of water and wastewater; and field support for bond/escrow actions. 
Various other city and state agencies are also involved in the site and subdivision plan review process. They are the department of solid waste, department of electric, police department, fire department, Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT), and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. These agencies are requested, by the department of development services to review plans on an "as-needed" basis, depending on the scope and nature of the individual plan. 
It is the stated mission of the City of Griffin, through the department of development services, department of water/wastewater, department of public works and the department of stormwater, to foster superior development through the provision of quality plan reviews and expeditious approvals. This is accomplished, in part, through a "one-stop" method of plan intake, review, approval, land permitting, and the project review team concept. 
1302. - GENERAL DEVELOPMENT REVIEW POLICY. 
It is the policy of the City of Griffin to consider the approval of site plans and subdivision plans and plans as part of a plan for the orderly, efficient and economical growth and development of the city. 
1303. - LOT STANDARDS AND RESTRICTIONS. 
1303 A. - Easements. 
No permanent structures or improvements shall be placed within any officially designated and recorded easement area. 
1303 B. - Substandard lots. 
1.  Lots of record. Any lot of record existing at the time of passage of this ordinance shall not be reduced, divided or changed so as to produce a tract of land which does not comply with the minimum dimension or area requirements of this ordinance for the district in which it is located. 
2.  Adjoining lots. When two or more adjoining lots with continuous frontage are in one ownership upon adoption of this ordinance and such lots individually are less than the minimum square footage and/or have less than the minimum width required in the district in which they are located, then such lots shall be considered as a single lot. When such combination of lots would create a single lot having a width of one and one-half times or more than the width and area required by this ordinance, then such lot may be divided into two lots of equal width and be used as conforming lots. 
3.  Lots not meeting minimum lot size requirements. Any lot of record existing at the time of the adoption of this ordinance which has an area or a width which is less than required by this ordinance may be used as a building site for a structure or other use permitted in that zone; provided the yards, setbacks, open space and other requirements are met that would be required for a standard lot of required size in that zoning district. These requirements may be adjusted as provided in Section 410.2. 
1303 C. - Every lot shall abut a street. 
No building shall be erected, constructed, moved or relocated on a lot which does not have immediate frontage on at least one public street for a distance of not less than the minimum allowed frontage for said lot as described in the physical requirements standards section of the applicable zoning district. 
1303 D. - Use of two or more lots to satisfy zoning requirements. 
1.  Two or more contiguous lots under the same ownership may be used to satisfy zoning requirements (i.e. lot size, setbacks, yards, lot coverage, parking, etc.) only after either a consolidation or boundary adjustment plat has been approved and recorded eliminating the common, internal lot line(s), provided that this provision shall not operate to conflict with section 2. below. 
2.  For shopping malls, shopping centers, office parks, mixed-use condominiums and industrial parks developed as a single project, but that include lots under separate ownership subsequent to, or in conjunction with the development of the project, the physical requirements and design standards of the City of Griffin such as parking, setbacks, yards, lot coverage, open space, utilities and access that are not met by each lot shall be satisfied by all of the property included in the project, as a whole. In such event, permanent easement(s) or the specific development standard(s) not met by each lot shall be noted on the approved site plan and properly granted and recorded providing for the joint use and maintenance for such items as necessary so that the development standard(s) are met by the project as a whole. 
Following review by the city attorney, the city shall approve the document granting the required easements to determine that easements can be properly granted and cause the project and the individual lot(s) to comply with the development standards. The approved easement document shall be recorded in the records of the Clerk of Superior Court of Spalding County. In addition, the city attorney shall review any future amendments to the easement document to ensure compliance with the City of Griffin Development Standards. 
1304. - PROCESS DETAILS AND CHARACTERISTICS. 
1304 A. - Project review committee. 
The project review committee concept, as stated above, is an integral part of the "one-stop" method of site and subdivision plan review. The committee concept is designed to provide an applicant with clear, consistent, concise and timely plan reviews. In addition, the committee provides a continuity of reviewer via the utilization of a "case manager" to insure that issues are resolved at their proper level and time in the process, and are not revisited once resolved. 
1.  Membership and composition. The case manager shall be the director of the department of development services or their designee. He or she will remain continually involved with the project throughout the entire development process, until all relevant land development permits have been issued. Other committee members shall consist of a representative from: 
a.  The department of public works; 
b.  The department of development services; 
c.  The department of stormwater; 
d.  The department of water/wastewater; 
e.  The department of solid waste; and 
f.  Consultant engineer. 
Other departments and agencies traditionally involved in the review process will function on an "as-needed" basis. 
2.  Committee meetings. The committee meets at designated critical points throughout the site development plan review process. These meetings are kept to a minimum in order to save staff time. 
3.  Responsibilities of the committee members. 
a.  The case manager shall coordinate the overall review and processing of an application, and ensure that department comments do not conflict. 
b.  The department of public works is responsible for the engineering review of the street aspects of the plan. This includes a review for conformity with this ordinance's technical standards, other city and state technical regulations, and other generally accepted engineering and safe design standards. 
c.  The department of stormwater is responsible for the stormwater aspects of the plan. This includes a review for conformity with this ordinance's technical standards, stormwater design ordinance, and other city and state technical regulations, and other generally accepted engineering and safe design standards. 
d.  The department of water/wastewater is responsible for the engineering review of the water and sewer aspects of the plan. This includes a review for conformity with this ordinance's technical standards, other city and state technical regulations, and other generally accepted engineering and safe design standards. 
e.  The department of solid waste is responsible for the engineering review of the solid waste aspects of the plan. This includes a review for conformity with this ordinance's technical standards, other city and state technical regulations, and other generally accepted engineering and safe design standards. 
1304 B. - Required plan types. 
1.  Preliminary site plans. These initial plan types are required for all projects resulting in the creation of three or more lots or any new development involving 1.1 acres or more. Preliminary plans are meant to show the general design of a site development or subdivision project and its public improvements so the city can indicate its approval or disapproval of the project prior to the time the final plans and plats are designed. The city shall review the practicability of the preliminary plan and its general design. Attention shall be given to the arrangement, location, and width of streets and travelways, arrangement, placement, and size of structures, their general relationship to the topography of the land, feasibility of water supply and sewage disposal, general handling of site drainage, lot sizes and arrangement, the future development of adjoining lands as yet undeveloped, the relationship of adjoining developed lands, and the requirements/guidelines of the comprehensive plan, zoning ordinance, and this ordinance. Preliminary plans are not meant to either depict, or be reviewed for, final engineering design and details. 
2.  Minor site plans. This plan type may be submitted when the proposed improvements are being requested to a site of less than 1.1 acres on which the city either has not previously approved a final site plan, or on which there is an existing approved plan that has been closed (built). In addition, the proposed improvements must be minor in nature and generally, (1) not change either the internal or external traffic flow patterns; (2) not increase the number of dwelling units; (3) not increase the nonresidential building size by more than 2,500 square feet, or 75 percent of the gross building area, whichever is less; and (4) generally, the proposed disturbed area should not exceed 5,000 square feet. The applicant must provide the department of stormwater an impervious site change form noting the limits of additional impervious area on the site. 
3.  Final site and subdivision plans (construction drawings). These plan types, and any necessary supporting documents, for a proposed project, constitute the complete application for construction approval. They shall include complete and detailed engineering and layout drawings for all the public and private improvements and utilities, in addition to any necessary ancillary calculations, required for review. Upon approval, the final plans and plats form the basis for the construction of the project and the inspection services of the department of development services. The final site plan shall be recorded with the Clerk of the Superior Court. An unrecorded plan is not a valid basis for site improvements or other commitments that depend on its design characteristics. 
1304 C. - Development plan review. 
1.  Once a complete application for a development plan has been submitted to the department of development services, and the appropriate fees paid, copies will be transmitted to a number of government agencies for their review and comment. Some of these reviews are necessary to meet city objectives. Other reviews are done to accommodate the applicant and expedite the process of development through coordination with state agencies. 
2.  Review of the aspects of the development plans, beyond the auspices of internal city agencies, are circulated by the department of development services to appropriate agencies such as the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT), Spalding County Planning Department (for plans on lots that abut the city/county boundary line) and the USDA Soil Conservation Service for review. 
3.  The basic review of a site development plan and subdivision plan is an analysis of the physical layout including the dimensions, the topography, the natural features of the site, proper erosion and sediment control provisions, and a determination of the use proposed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 
4.  Although the erosion and sedimentation control plan review is performed separately from the site development plan review, the city administers this review jointly with the site development plan review and site inspections. 
5.  All comments made by the review agencies must be satisfactorily addressed before the department of development services approves the plan. All approvals or denials shall be made in writing, stating the specific reasons therefore. The department of development services' approval in no way affects the authority of external agencies to issue their own permits for any aspect of the land development process which are within their respective jurisdiction. 
6.  Generally, the city shall make every effort to review development plans as expeditiously as possible. Once a completed application and required number of site plans are received by the department of development services, they are distributed to the applicable agencies. The first review period is ten working days. Comments are returned to the department of development services and if necessary, they are forwarded to the applicant's engineer, along with a set of "redlined" site plans for revisions. The second and third (if necessary) review periods, following receipt of required revisions, are five business days. These procedures are designed and intended to allow the city to review and approve minor site plans within 15 working days, preliminary residential plans within 30 days, and final subdivision and site plans within 45 days. 
7.  Following approval of the minor plan or final residential site and subdivision plan and/or the approval of an erosion and sedimentation control plan, the applicant may obtain land disturbance permits. 
8.  All applications for revisions to approved preliminary and final plans and plats shall be submitted to department of development services. Before being accepted, the application shall be reviewed for conformance with the appropriate minimum requirements and determination of the appropriate review time frames. The time frames and fee, if applicable, will be determined based on the complexity of the proposed revision. 
1304 D. - Plan validity periods. 
1.  Preliminary site plan validity. 
a.  All preliminary site plan approvals are valid for 12 months from their date of approval. 
b.  During that period, the following steps must be taken to maintain the validity (a) final plans are accepted for review, and are diligently pursued for approval, (b) final plans are approved, or (c) final plans are approved and permit issuance is being diligently pursued as demonstrated by bonding the plans and recording the plans. If a preliminary plan approval expires, no additional action shall be taken on the plan, or its subsequent final plans, without the submission of new preliminary plans and payment of all applicable fees. 
2.  Final site plan validity. All final site and subdivision plans and plans are valid for two years from their date of approval, subject to the following: 
a.  Requirements to be completed immediately following receipt of final approval. The applicant shall complete the items listed below subsequent to the receipt of final approval: 
i.  For site plans, record all related plans with the Spalding County Superior Court Clerk immediately following final approval (within ten days) without posting a performance bond and agreement. 
ii.  For subdivisions, record all related off-site plans immediately following approval (within ten days) without posting a performance bond and agreement. All remaining related plans (on-site plans) shall not be recorded until a performance bond and agreement has been posted. 
b.  Posting of a construction performance bond in accordance with this ordinance, if applicable. This is a prerequisite to the release of plans and deeds for recordation; issuance of site development permits, building permits, occupancy permits, etc. 
c.  Payment of any monetary and/or proffered contributions and/or obligations as established during the plan approval process, and referenced in the plan approval letter. This is a prerequisite to the release of the plans for recordation, or the issuance of site development permits, building permits, and/or occupancy permits. 
d.  Recordation of all plans. The applicant will return following recordation of the plans and deeds, a copy of the recording receipt, a reproducible Mylar copy of the plans, and a copy of the deeds, to the department of development services. This is a prerequisite to the issuance of site development permits, site preparation permits, building permits, and/or occupancy permits. 
e.  Completion of any other special items, agreements and/or post any other escrows enumerated in the plan approval letter. This is a prerequisite to the issuance of site development permits, building permits, and/or occupancy permits. 
f.  Provide department of development services with evidence of possession of all required permits. 
g.  Obtain a land disturbance permit. This is a prerequisite to the issuance of building permits. 
h.  Following the completion of the above-enumerated items, the department of development services shall issue, upon request, a building permit. 
i.  Schedule and hold a pre-construction conference with the departments of public works, stormwater and water/wastewater prior to initial commencement of land disturbance activities. 
j.  Failure to complete all the items enumerated in this section during the final plan validity period shall cause the approval to expire and void the final plans. If the final approval is voided, further consideration of the final plan will require a new plan submission, and payment of applicable fees. 
1304 E. - General plan and plan submission requirements. 
1.  Fees. The application and review fees for all plans are established by resolution of the board of commissioners. As such, the director of development services can waive no fees. The applicable fees shall accompany all application submissions. Development applications are not deemed complete until all applicable fees have been paid. 
2.  Number of plans to be submitted. Minor, preliminary and final site plan review. The design professional shall initially submit one complete set of plans. Following completion of a preliminary review, the department of development services will notify the applicant with the number of additional plan sets to be submitted. This number will be based on the number of established and required review agencies. Following the notification, the additional plan sets should be submitted to the department of development services within five business days. 
1304 F. - Minor site plan submission requirements. 
The following items shall be included with all minor site plans in order to have them accepted for review: 
1.  Administrative items. 
a.  A City of Griffin Department of Development Services Development Application Form completed in its entirety. If the property owner does not sign the form, a limited power of attorney form must accompany the application form.

Construction activity shall also be conducted only on those items for which a permit has been obtained. Failure to obtain required permits, or develop the site in accordance with approved plans, will necessitate the city taking any and all necessary actions required to correct the situation. Such actions may include, but shall not be limited to the following: 
1.  Posting of a stop work (construction) notice. Such notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the site in violation by a representative of the agency responsible for the inspection of the improvements being made, and also forwarded, by certified mail, to the developer. 
2.  Issuing a written notice to the owner or responsible agent, from the agency responsible for the inspection of the improvements, outlining the nature of the violation and requiring on-site activity to cease and desist immediately. A copy of the notice shall be sent to all other agencies responsible for inspections on that site. 
a.  This notice will instruct all other agencies to revoke all permits which may have been issued, cease making any further inspections on that site and cease processing any plans for that site, if the directors of development services, public works, stormwater or water/wastewater deems the violation to be of such a serious nature. 
b.  If cooperation is not received from the owner or responsible agent and work is not stopped immediately upon notice, a court injunction to stop work (construction) will be sought. 
3.  [Criminal process.] The directors of development services, public works, stormwater or water/wastewater may, if necessary or appropriate, seek criminal process against any person who violates any provisions of this ordinance. The issuance of a violation notice and correction order shall not be deemed a precondition to the issuance of a warrant or summons for such violation. In addition, the director of public works may seek immediate civil relief, regardless of what other action has been or will be taken. 
1308. - SITE PROTECTION. 
1308 A.

It is the purpose of this section to assure that infrastructure associated with development projects that is to be publicly dedicated is actually constructed to minimum design standards, acceptable to the city, and, once officially accepted, protected by an enforceable maintenance agreement for a period of two years. 
1309 B. - Performance agreements and guarantees. 
1.  A performance agreement, supported by an acceptable form of guarantee, shall be required on all projects that require public infrastructure including, but not limited to, streets, sidewalks, water, sewer, drainage facilities and improvements, parks and open space, and any other improvements that become the property of the City of Griffin for future maintenance purposes. This agreement and guarantee shall obligate the applicant to construct all required improvements, in accordance with approved plans, in a timely manner. Public agencies seeking site development plan approval may supply a letter of intent to comply with this requirement, provided that a performance agreement is secured from the contractor performing the construction, guaranteeing the construction will be completed in accordance with the approved site development plans and requirements. 
2.  A separate soil erosion and sedimentation control bond may be required on projects subject to the city's soil erosion and sedimentation control ordinance as a condition for issuance of any land disturbing activity permits to assure the timely installation and maintenance of required erosion control measures during the construction period. Requirements for such bond may be found in the city's soil erosion and sedimentation control ordinance. 
3.  The department of public works may also require, if applicable, an acceptable form of guarantee, to assure the timely construction and completion of required site improvements such as amenities, in accordance with approved plans including, but not limited to, recreational facilities, storm water facilities, parking, driveways, landscaping, and other improvements not intended for public dedication but which serve a common benefit to users and occupants of the development. 
4.  The term of the agreement shall correspond to the estimated length of the project construction period, as agreed upon between the applicant and the director of development services. Thereafter extensions may be permitted if requested in advance of the current expiration date. All agreements and any extension thereof shall be in writing. 
5.  The aggregate amount of all forms of guarantee posted on a project shall not exceed the total of the estimated cost of construction, as agreed upon between the applicant and the director of development services. In the event of a dispute, the amount reasonably determined by the director of development services shall be conclusive. 
1309 C. - Extensions and rebonding of agreements. 
1.  When a developer enters into an agreement with the City of Griffin, it is understood that all the necessary physical improvements must be completed in the specified period of time. If all the noted improvements are not completed within this time period, and no extension has been obtained, or a replacement agreement and bond have not been submitted and approved with a new expiration date, the agreement shall be deemed in default. 
2.  Approximately 60 days prior to the expiration of the agreement, the city shall notify the developer in writing of the expiration date. The notification shall advise the developer that he will be in default unless the work is completed in accordance with the agreement and approved plans, or an extension of time is obtained in accordance with the requirements of this policy. 
3.  The developer shall make a written request to the director of development services for an extension of the performance agreement's expiration date. 
a.  The first request may be for a period not to exceed one year. In order to receive the maximum extension, the developer must demonstrate that the extension would be in the best interest of the city. 
b.  If subsequent extensions are required, they will be for maximum periods of six months each. All requests shall be made at least 14 calendar days prior to the expiration date. 
c.  The developer must indicate the reasons and conditions that have precluded him from completing the required physical improvements.

d.  An additional fee to cover any necessary inspection and administrative costs shall be paid in accordance with the fee schedule for such inspections. 
4.  The director of development services, upon receipt of the extension request, will review the project particulars and may either deny or condition the extension granted. The factors to be considered by the director shall include the following: 
a.  Percentage of the project that has been completed. This shall be viewed as the percentage of the bonded improvements completed. Generally, this should be at least 50 percent for the first extension request and 85 percent for the second request. 
b.  Number of homes/units completed, occupied, and served by public facilities, if applicable. Generally, this should be at least ten percent of the project for each year (or prorated portion thereof) the project has been under construction. 
c.  Developer's performance history on prior projects in the City of Griffin. This shall be based on the developer's previous number of defaults. 
d.  The collective number, type, and validity of complaints lodged against the developer. 
e.  Whether the project provides access and/or infrastructure necessary for other projects that are either under construction or approved and no site development permits have been issued. 
5.  In the event the developer does not respond to the letter sent by the city cautioning him of impending default, and the project is not completed by the expiration date, the matter shall be reviewed by the director of development services for appropriate action including referral to the city attorney for action. 
1309 D. - Performance bond reductions. 
1.  Any form of guarantee may be partially released periodically (i.e., reduced) to an amount not less than either 25 percent of the project's highest bond value or not less than the actual cost of completion, whichever is higher, plus permitted allowances in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
2.  All reduction requests shall be submitted in writing to the director of development services. No request shall be deemed officially received unless submitted in accordance with the following requirements: 
a.  If an extension of the performance agreement is sought, every requirement for an extension request must be met, including, but not limited to, submission of written consent by the surety to any such request; 
b.  The request shall identify the project, performance agreement, bond, and completion date and must specify the amount of reduction sought. It shall also contain a detailed cost estimate, certified by the project design professional, of the remaining work and a projected timetable for completion. 
c.  A fee, covering any necessary inspection and administrative costs, shall be paid in accordance with the fee schedule. 
3.  Periodic partial bond reductions shall not occur before at least 30 percent of the bonded improvements have been satisfactory completed. 
4.  The city shall not be required to execute more than three reductions in any 12-month period, except as authorized by the director of development services. 
5.  No reduction shall be approved if the performance agreement is in default. However, reduction requests may be considered concurrently with extension requests. 
a.  In such instances as the director of development services deems appropriate, the developer shall furnish a certificate of completion, from a state licensed professional engineer, stating the work described has been performed in strict conformity with either the approved final plans, or as-built plans submitted therewith, and that the work meets all applicable standards. 
b.  The director of development services or his designee shall act upon any reduction request within 30 days of its official receipt. If the request is disapproved, the developer shall be notified in writing of the specific reasons for disapproval. If no action is taken within the time specified, the request shall be deemed approved and a partial release granted. 
1309 E. - Performance bond and agreement final release procedure.

Within ten business days of the receipt of the request, the director of development services shall either release the bond, or notify the developer of the specific agency approval not received. If no action is taken, the request shall be deemed approved and final release granted. 
1309 F. - Default and evaluation procedures. 
1.  If the developer fails to complete the required site improvements in the period of time specified in the agreement, or any approved extension, the developer is deemed in default. 
2.  The department of development services shall forward a report on the project to the city manager, with the director of development service's recommendation to formally declare the project to be in default. Such recommendation shall also enumerate a recommended course of action in response to default. Such recommendation may include the following, in any combination: 
a.  That the city attorney be authorized to institute such actions as deemed appropriate to enforce the provisions of this policy, the performance agreement and bond, and applicable code provisions. 
b.  That demand be made of the surety on the developer's bond for payment of the funds secured thereby, for application to completion of the project, or for performance of its principal's obligations. 
c.  That the city contract for completion of unfinished infrastructure. 
d.  That all or any portion of the project be vacated. 
e.  That any successor in interest to the defaulted developer be required to post an adequate replacement performance agreement. 
f.  That no additional building permits be issued for the project subject to the bond until an adequate right of entry permit bond is posted with the city. Such a bond shall bind and hold the applicant responsible for any and all damages to any public improvements already in place caused by work covered by the resulting right of entry permit and building permit. 
3.  The developer and surety will be mailed copies of the department of development service's report and recommendation. They also will be advised of their opportunity to be heard on the matter at the scheduled meeting of the board of commissioners. Either the developer or the surety, or both, may offer proposals for completion as alternatives to that of the recommendation of the director of development services. Any such proposal must be submitted in written form and signed by someone with the appropriate authority to issue a binding proposal. 
4.  All defaulted projects shall be scheduled for completion in chronological order of their declaration of default. Exceptions to a policy of first in, first out shall be made when the funds associated with a bond or letter of credit are collected by the city and cover the cost to complete the bondable items, and the project is eligible for acceptance. In such cases, the project shall be inserted into the existing project completion schedule as the next project to be handled by the city and/or its contractor. 
1310. - AS-BUILT PLANS. 
1310 A. 
As-built plans shall be required on all completed development projects accept those only requiring minor site plans.

2.  All piping to be tested must satisfactorily comply with the pressure tests before being eligible for acceptance. 
3.  Tests shall be conducted in accordance with AWWA Standard C-600 except as otherwise herein specified. 
1610 B. - Leakage testing. 
1.  After all piping has been placed; the contractor in the presence of a city inspector shall test each pipe run. Tests shall be continued until all leaks have been made tight to the satisfaction of the inspector. The contractor shall furnish all necessary meters, pumps, gauges, bulkheads and other materials and appliances necessary to conduct the required tests. Every precaution must be taken to valve-off or otherwise protect control equipment in or attached to the pipeline to prevent damage or injury thereto. 
2.  Before applying the specified test pressure, all air shall be expelled from the pipe. If hydrants, blow-offs or air release valves are not available at the high places, the contractor shall make the necessary taps at points of highest elevation before the test is made and insert plugs after the test has been completed. 
3.  Prior to the pressure test, pipe laid in trenches shall be adequately backfilled to secure the pipe during the test. Any observed leakage shall require corrective measures to pipe lines and/or joints as to the satisfaction of the inspector. 
4.  The city will furnish the necessary water for testing and disinfection of the lines. However, any water lost through breakage of lines, or unnecessary or excessive flushing of lines, will be charged to the contractor at the current residential rate. All lines shall be tested to a pressure of 200 psi for a minimum time of two hours. Test pressure shall not vary by more than five psi for the duration of the test. This may require periodic pumping, in which case the added water will be counted as part of the leakage. Lines shall be tested in sections between the valves. Allowable leakage amounts are found in Table 16-3 below: 

 
*If the pipeline under test contains sections of various diameters, the allowable leakage will be the sum of the computed leakage of each size. 
5.  Any section of the line not meeting the above test shall have the leaks found and corrected at once and re-tested until the leakage falls within the allowable limits. Leakage testing must be witnessed and approved by the city. 
1610 C. - Disinfection. 
After leakage testing and all necessary repairs have been made, the lines shall be flushed clean and then disinfected in accordance with AWWA Standard for Disinfecting Water Mains, C651-92, subject to the following special conditions: 
1.  The method of disinfection shall be the Continuous—Feed Method in accordance with AWWA C651-92, Section 5.2. The potable water shall be chlorinated so after at 24-hour holding period in the main, there will be a free chlorine residual of not less than ten mg/L. 
2.  The form of chlorine may be either: a one percent solution made from either sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite. The chlorine shall be pumped and metered into the pipeline. Water must be flowing during the feeding operation and the injection point must be located so the flow of water will disperse the chlorine throughout the pipeline. 
3.  The contractor has the option of discharging the highly chlorinated water flushed from the pipeline to the existing sewers (if available) or dechlorinating prior to discharge. 
4.  After 24 hours, the line shall be flushed until the chlorine content is not more than two parts per million, and samples taken at various points along the line. The contractor has the option of delivering the samples to the water and wastewater department for testing or to an independent laboratory. The laboratory must be pre-approved by the owner and hold appropriate certification from Georgia environmental protection division. 
5.  The city must witness all flushing, disinfection, sampling and dechlorination work. The contractor shall outline his planned procedures for these tasks and obtain approval of the owner before commencing this work. 
6.  Dechlorination. 
a.  After the disinfection process has been completed and the contractor elects to dechlorinate, the heavily chlorinated water shall be flushed from the main until measurements show that the chlorine concentration in the water leaving the main is no higher than that generally prevailing in the distribution system or is acceptable for domestic use. The area where the chlorinated water is to be discharged shall be inspected. If there is any possibility that the chlorinated discharge will cause damage to the environment, then a neutralizing chemical shall be applied to the water to be wasted to neutralize thoroughly the chlorine residual remaining in the water. 
b.  The chlorine residual of water being disposed may be neutralized by treating the water with one of the chemicals listed in Table 16-4 below: 

 
Note:  Amounts of chemicals required to neutralize various residual chlorine concentrations in 100,000 gal. (378.5 m3) of water.

1707 B. 
Peak flows will be determined using Table 17-2. 
1707 C. 
Considerations will be given to domestic, commercial, institutional and industrial wastes plus groundwater infiltration in determining the necessary capacity of the sewer system. 

 
 *Acres refer to gross acreage minus the floodplain area as established. 
**Design of sewer facilities to serve these land uses shall be on a case-by-case basis depending on specific uses. 
1708. - SANITARY SEWER DESIGN CRITERIA. 
1708 A. - General. 
The criteria listed herein is not intended to cover all aspects of design, but rather to mention the basic guidelines and those particulars that are required by the City of Griffin. For more detailed criteria, the design should refer to standard references such as "Ten States Standards", Georgia EPD rules, Water Pollution Control Federation Manual of Practice No. FD-5, and other available literature. 
1708 B. - Types of sanitary sewers. 
All sanitary sewers for the conveyance of wastewater shall be designed as separate sanitary sewers in which groundwater, stormwater or other runoff from roofs, streets, parking lots, foundation drains and any source other than wastewater are excluded. Overflows from sanitary sewers shall not be permitted. 
1708 C. - Design period. 
Gravity sanitary sewer pipelines should be designed in accordance with the city's wastewater management plan and should, as a minimum, be designed with capacity sufficient to handle the estimated tributary population 20 to 40 years into the future. Tributary population is considered to be all areas upstream of the discharge point of the system being designed as well as any anticipated pumped flow from other basins. Sanitary sewers shall be designed and installed to the uppermost property line of the development being served. Consideration should be given to the maximum anticipated capacity of institutions, industrial parks, etc. 
1708 D. - Capacity and size determinations. 
In determining the required capacities of sanitary sewers, the following factors shall be considered: 
1.  Maximum hourly sewage flow; 
2.  Additional maximum sewage or waste flow from industrial plants; 
3.  Groundwater infiltration; 
4.  Topography of the area; and 
5.  Depth of excavation. 
New sanitary sewer systems shall be designed on the basis of an average daily flow of sewage of not less than 400 gallons per household per day. Normally, all sanitary sewers shall be designed for a peak flow of not less than 2.5 times the average flow; this peak factor will be higher for smaller basins. Sanitary sewers shall be designed to carry the peak flow when flowing at a depth of one-half the pipe diameter. 
1708 E. - Slope. 
All sanitary sewers shall be so designed and constructed to give mean velocities, when flowing full of not less than two feet per second based on Manning's formula using an "n" value of 0.013. Table 7-2 below indicates the minimum slopes that should be provided; however, slopes greater than these are desirable: 

 
These minimum slopes shall be used only when sufficient flows are expected to maintain a velocity of two feet per second and maintain a cleaning action in the line. Sanitary sewers shall be laid with uniform slope between manholes. Sanitary sewers on 20 percent slopes or greater shall be ductile iron pipe and shall be anchored securely with concrete anchors (see standard details) to prevent displacement by erosion or shock. The maximum slopes of sanitary sewers shall be 30 percent and sanitary sewers shall be designed at less than 20 percent whenever possible. 
1708 F. - Increasing size. 
When a small sanitary sewer is connected to a larger sewer, the connection shall not be lower than matching the top of both sewers to the same elevation. 
1708 G. - Gravity sanitary sewer pipe. 
The city reserves the right to disallow any manufacturer that does not have a consistent, long-term record of quality control and successful product performance. Gravity sewer pipe up through 15-inch diameter will normally be polyvinyl chloride (PVD), solid wall type SDR26 thickens meeting ASTM D3034. Ductile iron pipe (DIP) shall be used where certain conditions exist (see discussion of DIP). For 18-inch diameter pipe and larger, the contractor may have the option of using either high density polyethylene (HDPE), PVC, reinforced concrete pipe (RCP), or DIP. The city may approve the other types of pipe on a case-by-case basis and may limit the options of type of pipe depending on site conditions. All buried PVC pipe shall be marked continuously with metalized locator wire. This should be addressed at the preliminary plan review stage. 
1708 H. - Sanitary sewer pipe bedding. 
Bedding for sanitary sewer pipe shall be as follows (see also standard details): 
1.  For PVC, HDPE and any other pipe made of plastics or resins the minimum bedding shall be class "B". 
2.  For RCP and DIP pipe the minimum bedding shall be class "C".

Any individual segment that exceeds the allowable infiltration shall be corrected to within allowable limits. 
6.  Compaction of backfill. Compaction testing shall be required for construction in paved areas or where pavement is planned. A minimum of five tests per 1,000 feet of sanitary sewer shall be conducted at varying depths. If any of these tests show failing results, the failing backfill shall be removed, re-compacted and re-tested, and one additional area shall also be tested. 
1712 F. - Additional testing requirements. 
The contractor shall also perform the tests listed below during the presence of the developer's professional. The city must be notified at least two days prior to these tests being conducted to afford the city the opportunity to be present. 
1.  Mandrel test for gravity sanitary sewer PVC pipe. The procedure for testing PVC sanitary sewer pipe for maximum allowable deflection shall be generally as follows (see ASTM specs for mandrel dimensions and more detail): 
a.  Completely flush the line making sure the pipe is clean of any mud or trash that would hinder the passage of the mandrel. During the final flushing of the line, attach a floating block or ball to the end of the mandrel pull rope and float the rope through the line (a nylon ski rope is recommended). After the rope is threaded through the line, connect the pull rope to the mandrel and place the mandrel in the entrance of the pipe. Connect a second rope to the back of the mandrel. This will enable the mandrel to be retrieved if excessive deflection is encountered. Draw the mandrel through the sanitary sewer line. An increasing resistance to pull is an indication of excessive deflection. If this occurs mark the rope to note the location. Televise the sanitary sewer section to identify the extent of the problem and develop a plan, subject to city approval, for correcting the problem. A retest shall then be undertaken. 
2.  Air pressure test. The contractor, to check for leaks, shall conduct a low-pressure test of each gravity sanitary sewer line section. The following general procedures will apply (also refer to ASTM specs): 
a.  Temporarily plug the line segment between two manholes using plugs with airtight fittings through which low-pressure air can be introduced into the pipe segment being tested. Introduce low-pressure air into the test pipe segment until the internal air pressure reaches 4.5 psig above ground water pressure, if any. Wait at least five minutes for air temperature in the test segment to stabilize while internal air pressure remains at least 3.5 psig above ground water pressure. Bleed internal air pressure to exactly 3.5 psig above ground water pressure. Accurately determine the elapsed time for the internal pressure to drop to 2.5 psig above ground water pressure. The air test is acceptable is elapsed time is no less than shown on table 7-4 below. 
b.  Excessive leakage shall be permanently corrected and the test repeated until the developer's professional witnesses a successful test on each line segment. 
c.  Note: Upon request, the city may allow substitution of an exfiltration test in lieu of the air pressure test. If used, the exfiltration test shall be conducted with a minimum water head of two feet above the groundwater table and the allowable exfiltration shall be limited to 25 gallons per day per inch diameter of pipe per mile of pipe. 

 
3.  Inspections. Sewer mains are to be television inspected under flow conditions to verify accuracy of slope, alignment displacement of gaskets and cleanliness of the pipe. Two copies of the video inspection are to be submitted to the City of Griffin and must include a written log report of the testing sequence and conditions. 
4.  Damp pipe required. Air leakage time is based on the pipe being damp. If pipe and joints are dry, dampen line if helpful in meeting air test time requirement. 
5.  Force main pressure testing. Before applying the specified test pressure, all air shall be expelled from the pipe. All pipe laid in trenches shall be backfilled adequately to secure the pipe during the test. Any observed leakage shall require corrective measures to pipe lines and/or joints as otherwise provided for in these specifications and to the satisfaction of the city. The city will furnish the necessary water for testing the force main. However, any water lost through breakage of lines or unnecessary or excessive flushing of the line shall be charged to the developer. The force main must be flushed and tested at a pressure of 200 psi for six hours. When testing at the specified pressures, the rate of leakage shall not exceed 25 gallons per 24 hours per inch diameter per mile of line (see table 7-5 below). If the force main does not meet this test, the leaks shall be found and corrected at once and re-tested until the leakage falls within the limits specified. 
6.  Vacuum testing manholes. 
a.  Manholes shall be tested before the ring and cover and grade adjustment rings are installed, and after backfill and compaction is complete. 
b.  Conduct tests in conformance with ASTM C1244 and these specifications. 
c.  Preparation for tests: 
i.  All lift holes, joints and other imperfections shall be filled with an approved non-shrink grout, to provide a smooth finish appearance. 
ii.  All pipes entering the manhole shall be temporarily plugged, taking care to securely brace the pipes and plugs to prevent them from being drawn into the manholes. 
d.  Test procedures: 
i.  The test head shall be placed at the top of the manhole in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation. 
ii.  A vacuum of ten inches mercury shall be drawn in the manhole, the valve on the vacuum line of the test head closed, and the vacuum pump shut off. 
iii.  The time shall be measured for the vacuum drop to nine inches mercury. 
iv.  The manhole shall pass if the time for the vacuum reading to drop from ten inches mercury to nine inches mercury meets or exceeds the values indicated in the following table: 

 
1 Round actual depth of manhole to next depth up (ex. 11-foot deep manhole, use depth of 10 feet). 
v.  If the manhole fails any test, necessary repairs shall be made by an approved method and the manhole shall be retested until a satisfactory test is obtained. 

 
1712 G. - Final inspection and conditional acceptance. 
1.  No buildings or plumbing fixtures shall be connected to the sanitary sewers until inspected and approved by the city. 
2.  The professional responsible for inspection of the construction shall provide the city with an engineering statement after he completes his inspection, testing and submittal of as-built drawings and easements. This statement must certify that all specified inspections and tests have been made and successfully passed, and that the work has been completed in substantial accordance with the approved plans and specifications. After receipt of this statement, the city will schedule a final inspection. A representative of the developer's professional and the contractor shall be present during this final inspection. 
3.  After any discrepancies are corrected, the city will issue a letter certifying conditional acceptance of the system. This letter shall commence the start of the 24-month warranty period that is required of the contractor. 
4.  At the end of the warranty period, the subdivision inspection team will again inspect the entire development. When all discrepancies have been corrected, the city will issue an acceptance letter and will begin perpetual maintenance and operation of the system. 
1712 H. - Maintenance and payment bond. 
The developer shall post a maintenance bond on the facility, in accordance with these regulations, for a two-year period after completion and conditional acceptance of the facility by the city. In addition, the developer shall post a payment bond on the facility for all subcontractor and material supplier work. 
1712 I. - Maintenance until final acceptance. 
It shall be the developer's obligation to provide all maintenance for a two-year period after conditional acceptance of the project by the city. At the end of the maintenance period the city shall inspect the sewer system, and upon correction by the developer of all deficiencies noted by the city, the city will accept the system for operation.
