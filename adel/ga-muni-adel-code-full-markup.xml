         <div type="preface">
            <p>PREFACE                   This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Adel, Georgia. 
                  Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1986 Code, as supplemented through December 5, 1994, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1986 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
                  The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
                  Chapter and Section Numbering System 
                  The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
                  Page Numbering System 
                  The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

                   
                  Indexes 
                  The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
                  Looseleaf Supplements 
                  A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
                  Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
                  Acknowledgments 
                  This publication was under the direct supervision of Ron McLaughlin, Supervising Editor, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

                  ORDINANCE NO. 97-18

                  Be it Ordained by the Mayor and the City Council of the City of Adel, Georgia: 
                  Section 1. The Code entitled "Code of the City of Adel, Georgia," published by Municipal Code Corporation consisting of Chapters 1 to 82, each inclusive, is adopted. 
                  Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before August 18, 1997, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein are repealed. 
                  Section 3. The repeal provided for in Section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
                  Section 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 or imprisonment not to exceed 180 days, or both such fine and imprisonment. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the municipal judge may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
                  Section 5. Additions and amendments to the Code, when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the mayor and city council to make the same a part of the Code, shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments. 
                  Section 6. Ordinances adopted after August 18, 1997, that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code. 
                  Section 7. This ordinance shall become effective December 15, 1997. 
                  Passed and adopted by the mayor and city council this 15th day of December, 1997. 


                  SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
                  The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code and are considered "Omits." 
                  In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the Code's historical evolution.

               Editor's note— Printed herein is the Charter of the City of Adel, Georgia, derived from 1960 Ga. Laws, page 3055, approved March 17, 1960. The Charter is set out as originally enacted and as amended by subsequent acts. The amendments to the Charter are indicated by the presence of a history note in parentheses ( ) following the section or subsection amended. The absence of such a note indicates that a section or subsection has remained unchanged since it was originally enacted. It should be noted that the directory provisions of the acts amending the city's 1960 Charter, including severability, repealer and effective date provisions, are not included herein. The original arrangement, catchlines and subcatchlines of the Charter have been retained herein wherever possible. Catchlines and italicized subcatchlines have been added where needed to facilitate indexing and for ease of reference. Material which has been added for clarity is indicated by brackets [ ] and is of no legal effect. Obvious errors in spelling and punctuation have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes a uniform system of citation to state statutes and capitalization has been used. 
               The Charter has been divided into articles for facility of usage. Article I consists of the city's 1960 Charter and all amendments to specific provisions thereof. Article II consists of amendments of a nonspecific nature that have added material to the Charter.

                  (5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meanings of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

                  Rules of order may be suspended in the case of an emergency. A motion to suspend the rules requires a second, is debatable and requires a three-fifths vote of the council. Rules governing quorum (section 2-62), voting methods and requirements (section 2-63 and section 2-64), the notification to commissioners of meetings (section 2-75 and section 2-76) and rules necessary for compliance with state law cannot be suspended.

In addition to council members, committees may include other city officials, staff or citizens at large. Whenever a committee is created, its duties, any limitation on the scope of its duties, and the times, places and periods of time for which the committee may operate shall be determined by the mayor with the concurrence of the council.

                  Subdivision B. - Parliamentary Procedure 

                  Sec. 2-81. - Main motion. 
                  In order for mayor and council to take any official action on any subject, a council member must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the mayor until another council member agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the council member seconding the motion to support the motion. A council member may withdraw a main motion that he has made at any time before the council has voted on that motion. 
                  (Ord. No. 01-03, § 2-01, 4-2-01) 
                  Sec. 2-82. - Debate. 
                  (a)  After the main motion is recognized by the mayor, the council shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the mayor in a manner that is fair to all members of the council. Council members can participate in the debate only when they are recognized by the mayor. 
                  (b)  During the course of debate, council member may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the council take a particular action on a motion (section 2-85). There are two classes of subsidiary motions: debatable subsidiary motions and undebatable subsidiary motions. Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee, and postpone to a time certain. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three undebatable subsidiary motions: limit debate, vote immediately, and, lay on the table. They require a second and cannot be debated. 
                  (c)  Council members may also introduce privileged motions (section 2-86). Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on privileged motions. 
                  (Ord. No. 01-03, § 2-02, 4-2-01) 
                  Sec. 2-83. - Voting; procedure. 
                  Voting on debatable motions and voting on undebatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions: 
                  (1)  Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways: 
                  a.  If debate has been completed and no other council member wishes to speak, the mayor can call for the vote. If there are no objections, then the mayor can proceed with the vote. 
                  b.  If the mayor calls for the vote and there is an objection, a council member may move to vote immediately ("move the previous question"). If this motion is seconded and approved by a three-fifths vote, debate will stop. The mayor will then read the proposed motion to the council and ask for the votes of the council members. 
                  (2)  Undebatable motions. In the case of undebatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the mayor. The mayor shall read the proposed motion to the council and then call for the vote. 
                  (Ord. No. 01-03, § 2-03, 4-2-01) 
                  Sec. 2-84. - Ranking of motions. 
                  (a)  Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. A motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. The higher motion must be decided before the council returns to consider the motion of lower precedence. 
                  (b)  A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and does take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section. Motions at the bottom of the following list take precedence over motions at the top of the list: 

                   
                  (Ord. No. 01-03, § 2-04, 4-2-01) 
                  Sec. 2-85. - Subsidiary motions. 
                  During the course of debate, council members may introduce motions that propose that the council take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions and they allow a board to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions, amend, limit debate and vote immediately, can also apply to other subsidiary motions. 
                  (1)  Postpone indefinitely. If a council member believes that the main motion should not be considered by the council, that council member may move to postpone the consideration of the main motions indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled. A motion to postpone indefinitely can be debated but it cannot be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (2)  Amend. If a council member believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion. Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend. Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a time certain and the motion to recess can also be amended. A motion cannot be amended more than two times. Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable. A majority vote is required for the council to adopt an amendment. If the amendment is adopted then the council shall consider the amended version of the motion. 
                  (3)  Refer to a committee (commit). If a council member believes that further information is needed before mayor and council can act on a main motion, he may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, then a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to refer should specify the date that the committee or department will report back to the mayor and council. This motion is debatable and amendable. A majority is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (4)  Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a council member believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. It is debatable and can be amended. If this motion is passed, the mayor will bring the original motion back to the council for consideration at the specified time. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (5)  Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the council member who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion and a three-fifths vote is required. 
                  (6)  Vote immediately (previous question). If a council member believes that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the council member can move to vote immediately. The motion is undebatable and a vote of three-fifths of the council is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (7)  Lay on the table (postpone temporarily). A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the meeting. The motion can be brought up for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the council during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion and the motion is not amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (Ord. No. 01-03, § 2-05, 4-2-01) 
                  Sec. 2-86. - Privileged motions. 
                  Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting. They do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on these motions. 
                  (1)  Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the mayor concerning the rights of a council member or of the council as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The mayor is required to make a ruling on the question. 
                  (2)  Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on this motion but the motion can be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (3)  Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a council member must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion and as a result it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second, but is not debatable or amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
                  (Ord. No. 01-03, § 2-06, 4-2-01) 
                  Sec. 2-87. - Incidental motions. 
                  Incidental motions allow council members to exert their rights as a member of the council. Incidental motions can be introduced at any time during a meeting. 
                  (1)  Appeal. If a council member disagrees with a decision that is made by the mayor, that council member may appeal the decision. If the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the council. The mayor has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The council may then debate the appeal. The mayor and council shall decide by majority vote if the mayor's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is highest in precedence and can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (2)  Parliamentary inquiry. If a council member has a question about the rules of order, he may ask the chair to give an opinion on that question. This question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the mayor and council. This motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. This motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (3)  Point of order (question of order). If a council member believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The mayor can make a ruling on the question or can allow the mayor and council to debate and then rule on the question by majority vote. A point of order can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table. 
                  (4)  Point of information (request for information). If a council member has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, he may ask a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the mayor and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required and the motion is not debatable or amendable. 
                  (Ord. No. 01-03, § 2-07, 4-2-01) 
                  Sec. 2-88. - Supplementary main motions. 
                  Three motions allow the council to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the council. These motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the ways specified. 
                  (1)  Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the council to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at a meeting that is in progress. It allows the council to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any council member can make a motion to reconsider and any council member may second the motion. The motion is debatable but it cannot be amended. A majority vote of the council is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided and the council will return to debate and revote the original motion. 
                  (2)  Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the council overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any council member. It is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the council member seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting pursuant to section 2-67. The motion to rescind will then be placed on the agenda for the next meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will be formally made. If it is seconded, then the council shall debate and vote on rescission. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided. 
                  (3)  Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the council to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. This motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. It is a main motion but ranks higher than any debatable motion. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass.

                  (c)  In recognition of this, the State of Georgia specifically prohibited the use of video poker machines in 2006; and since, various programs have been created that allow computers and other electronic machines and devices to conduct a sweepstakes which purportedly entitle participants to have a chance to win various prizes and rewards in return for the purchase of token services or products such as internet service, telephone cards, and office supplies, among other products; and certain companies are advertising on the internet that these sweepstakes are legal in the State of Georgia. (see www.cashoutgaming.com ); and these websites explain how to evade the gambling laws in states such as Georgia by establishing sweepstakes parlors. 
                  (d)  These business models appear to represent an attempt to circumvent the laws of the State of Georgia that generally prohibit gambling and illegal lotteries and the sale of goods or services to patrons appears to be no more than a subterfuge for promoting gambling on the premises. 
                  (e)  A number of jurisdictions around the United States either have passed or are contemplating the passage of laws, statutes, or ordinances banning or prohibiting such sweepstakes parlors, and on March 21, 2011, the mayor and council passed a 120-day moratorium on accepting and processing applications for businesses that intended on operating sweepstakes parlors. 
                  (f)  The mayor and city council finds that promoting and establishing nonsanctioned lotteries is illegal in the State of Georgia and constitutes commercial gambling. 
                  (g)  The mayor and council find that requiring participants in a sweepstakes scheme to: (1) pay any tangible consideration to the operator of such business in the form of money or other property or thing of value; or (2) purchase any goods, wares, merchandise, or anything of value from such business to be eligible for a prize further constitutes an illegal lottery. 
                  (h)  The mayor and council find that it is in the best interests of the health and general welfare of the residents and businesses of the City of Adel that sweepstakes that are conducted by requiring a participant to access, play or enter the sweepstakes only through the purchase of a product or service should be banned in the city. 
                  (i)  The mayor and council further find that requiring a participant to purchase goods and services, even if the good and services have an independent value equal to that charged to the participant, is a mere token form of consideration and is illegal; the Attorney General of the State of Georgia also concluded that such a method of business was illegal. 
                  (j)  Permit denial. 
                  (1)  The provisions set forth above are incorporated by reference into this article and represent the legislative findings of the City Council and the Mayor of the City of Adel; 
                  (2)  Any such method of operating a sweepstakes as described above, shall be banned in the City of Adel; 
                  (3)  Any and all businesses that plan on utilizing such a sweepstakes shall be informed of the ordinance from which this article derives, prohibiting the use of same; 
                  (4)  The refusal to abide by the terms of this article shall be grounds for the denial of any permit the business applicant seeks.

                  Sec. 30-143. - Exemptions. 
                  This article shall apply to any land-disturbing activity undertaken by any person on any land except for the following: 
                  (1)  Surface mining, as the same is defined in O.C.G.A. 12-4-72, "The Georgia Surface Mining Act of 1968". 
                  (2)  Granite quarrying and land clearing for such quarrying; 
                  (3)  Such minor land-disturbing activities as home gardens and individual home landscaping, repairs, maintenance work, fences, and other related activities which result in minor soil erosion; 
                  (4)  The construction of single-family residences, when such construction disturbs less than one acre and is not a part of a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre and not otherwise exempted under this paragraph; provided, however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the minimum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 and this paragraph. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this paragraph, there shall be a buffer zone between the residence and any state waters classified as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land-disturbing activity shall be constructed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for first order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams flow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of subsection (b) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 and the buffer zones provided by this paragraph shall be enforced by the local issuing authority; 
                  (5)  Agricultural operations as defined in O.C.G.A. 1-3-3, "definitions", to include raising, harvesting or storing of products of the field or orchard; feeding, breeding or managing livestock or poultry; producing or storing feed for use in the production of livestock, including but not limited to cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep, and rabbits or for use in the production of poultry, including but not limited to chickens, hens and turkeys; producing plants, trees, fowl, or animals; the production of aquaculture, horticultural, dairy, livestock, poultry, eggs and apiarian products; farm buildings and farm ponds; 
                  (6)  Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt forestry practices cause or result in land-disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in paragraphs (15) and (16) of subsection 30-144(c), no other land-disturbing activities, except for normal forest management practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period of three years after completion of such forestry practices; 
                  (7)  Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture; 
                  (8)  Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within 200 feet of the bank of any state waters, and for purposes of this paragraph, "state waters" excludes channels and drainageways which have water in them only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water in them year-round; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre, which involves land-disturbing activity, and which is within 200 feet of any such excluded channel or drainageway, must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which such project is located and provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the local issuing authority from regulating any such project which is not specifically exempted by paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (9) or (10) of this section; 
                  (9)  Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the Department of Transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the State Road and Tollway Authority; or any road construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided, however, that construction or maintenance projects of the Department of Transportation or the State Road and Tollway Authority which disturb one or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to provisions of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7.1; except where the Department of Transportation, the Georgia Highway Authority, or the State Road and Tollway Authority is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case a copy of a notice of intent under the state general permit shall be submitted to the local issuing authority, the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; 
                  (10)  Any land-disturbing activities conducted by any electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power; except where an electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United states engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; and 
                  (11)  Any public water system reservoir. 
                  (Ord. No. 09-16. § III, 7-1-09) 
                  Sec. 30-144. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
                  (a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this ordinance shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 30-144(b) and (c). The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
                  (b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs 
                  (1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections 30-144(b) and (c) shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with this subsection (b)(2) or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
                  (2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
                  (3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
                  (4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
                  (5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections 30-144(c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 (c). 
                  (c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
                  (1)  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
                  (2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
                  (3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
                  (4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
                  (5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
                  (6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
                  (7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
                  (8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
                  (9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
                  (10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
                  (11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
                  (12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
                  (13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
                  (14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsections 30-144(b)(2); 
                  (15)  Except as provided in subsection 30-144(c), there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  (i)  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  (ii)  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
                  (16)  There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
                  a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
                  b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
                  (i)  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
                  (ii)  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
                  (d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 30-144(b) and (c). 
                  (e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (Ord. No. 09-16. § IV, 7-1-09) 
                  Sec. 30-145. - Application/permit process. 
                  (a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
                  (b)  Application requirements. 
                  (1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Adel without first obtaining a permit from the planning and zoning administrator to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
                  (2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the planning and zoning administrator and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 30-145(c). Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 30-144(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by two copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
                  (3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the Division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
                  (4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the District, and any variances required by subsections 30-144(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 30-145(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
                  (5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this ordinance section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
                  (6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
                  (c)  Plan requirements. 
                  (1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 30-144(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this ordinance. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the Commission and in consultation with the Division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-20. 
                  (2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Plan Review Checklist established by the Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
                  (d)  Permits. 
                  (1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
                  (2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsections 30-144(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsections 30-145(b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
                  (3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
                  (4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
                  (5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
                  (6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A.12-7-7(f)(1). 
                  (Ord. No. 09-16. § V, 7-1-09) 
                  Sec. 30-146. - Inspection and enforcement. 
                  (a)  The planning and zoning administrator will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this ordinance, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
                  (b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
                  (c)  The planning and zoning administrator shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this ordinance, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
                  (d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the Commission, the District, or Division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
                  (e)  The districts or the Commission or both shall periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as Local Issuing Authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 (a). The districts or the Commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The districts or the Commission shall notify the Division and request investigation by the Division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
                  (f)  The Division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as Local Issuing Authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. Section 12-7-8 (a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 (a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-7 (e), the Division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the Division, the Division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a.

                  Sec. 30-147. - Penalties and incentives. 
                  (a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
                  (b)  Stop-work orders. 
                  (1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
                  (2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and; 
                  (3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
                  (4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
                  (c)  Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this ordinance and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 30-145(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
                  (d)  Monetary penalties. 
                  (1)  Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this ordinance under county ordinances approved under this ordinance shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation.

                  Sec. 30-148. - Education and certification. 
                  (a)  Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspection or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on their level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-20. 
                  (b)  For each site on which land-disturbing activity occurs, each entity or person acting as either a primary, secondary, or tertiary permittee, as defined in the state general permit, shall have as a minimum one person who is in responsible charge of erosion and sedimentation control activities on behalf of said entity or person and meets the applicable education or training certification requirements developed by the Commission present on site whenever land-disturbing activities are conducted on that site. A project site shall herein be defined as any land-disturbance site or multiple sites within a larger common plan of development or sale permitted by an owner or operator for compliance with the state general permit. 
                  (c)  Persons or entities involved in projects not requiring a state general permit but otherwise requiring certified personnel on site may contract with certified persons to meet the requirements of this article. 
                  (d)  If a state general permittee who has operational control of land-disturbing activities for a site has met the certification requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-19, then any person or entity involved in land-disturbing activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet those educational requirements specified in paragraph (4) of subsection (b) of O.C.G.A 12-7-19 and shall not be required to meet any educational requirements that exceed those specified in said paragraph.

                  (c)  Liability. 
                  (1)  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this article, nor the compliance with provisions of this article shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the local issuing authority or District for damage to any person or property. 
                  (2)  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
                  (3)  No provision of this article shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby.

                  Sec. 30-172. - General standards for stormwater management. 
                  The following standards shall pertain to all stormwater management planning: 
                  (1)  Each development shall incorporate stormwater management facilities sufficient to maintain pre-development peak discharge rates across adjacent property lines. This requirement may be waived where a suitable means of flow into a downstream discharge point is accessible; or where the applicant provides a drainage system with adequate capacity to carry site flows to an ultimate downstream discharge point. 
                  (2)  No development shall be undertaken that can be shown to appreciably increase the flood potential within the development, or on adjacent surrounding lands. If such potential is in question, the city shall make the final determination.

                  Sec. 30-173. - Drainage design standards, methodology, and criteria. 
                  (a)  The 25-year, 24-hour frequency storm shall be used in the design of all drainage systems and runoff detention/retention structures unless the project falls into a department of transportation or federal category. 
                  (b)  All applications for development shall provide for on-site detention (dry or wet), or percolation of stormwater sufficient to maintain pre-development 25-year, 24-hour frequency peak discharges after development has occurred. The site shall be the total area of development. If so, the larger storm design will dictate the design storm. Surface runoff calculations shall consider the entirety of all drainage areas that extend off-site upstream. These flows may be approximated using runoff coefficients or other methods acceptable to the city. Computation of surface runoff shall utilize one or both of the following methodologies: 
                  (1)  The Rational Method 
                  a.  0—10 acre tracts—Will include consideration of existing conditions surrounding the tract to be developed within 500 feet of the boundaries thereof if contributory to or impacted by the development. 
                  b.  The following design criteria shall be used for either methodology chosen for computation: 
                  1.  Design storm. The design storm for the city shall be the 25-year frequency, 24-hour, 7.5 inch rainfall, antecedent condition II. 
                  2.  Impacts—Required. 
                  i.  Site inflows C.F.S. + (Hydrograph). 
                  ii.  Site outflows C.F.S. + (Hydrograph). 
                  iii.  Backwater effects. 
                  iv.  Soil characteristics. 
                  v.  Static water levels. 
                  vi.  Peak water levels—25-year storm. 
                  vii.  Peak water levels shall be checked relative to a 100 year storm frequency in setting first floor elevations. 
                  viii.  Predevelopment conditions shall be carefully evaluated as to adequacy of drainage design (if any), and removed, replaced, or reworked if found unsatisfactory. 
                  3.  Method. 
                  i.  Previous surface usage shall incorporate underlying soil characteristics. 
                  ii.  The Macon Intensity-Duration Curve shall be used in computations. 
                  iii.  S.C.S.-T.R. 55 Method—The minimum C.N. used shall be 39 with a Class A soil characteristic. 
                  (c)  Detention (dry or wet) or percolation areas may utilize on-site areas, providing that the developer will bear the total cost of such improvements, show there are no adverse effects upstream or downstream, and obtain the approval of the city. 
                  (d)  The hydrologic requirements for proposed development sites shall be determined in accordance with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Services (SCS) Technical Release No. 55, entitled Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds and SCS National Engineering Handbook, Section 4, entitled Hydrology. Other methodology may be used when approved by the city. A pre-design conference with the city is suggested on small projects not affecting major drainage ways or environmentally sensitive areas, and will be required on all major developments. 
                  (e)  CN numbers shall not be less than the minimums established in SCS National Engineering Handbook Section 4, Hydrology and shall be in all cases acceptable to the city. 
                  (f)  The peak value of the discharge hydrograph or runoff calculations for the developed or redeveloped site shall not exceed, in terms of peak flow, the peak value of the discharge hydrograph or runoff calculations of conditions existing prior to development or redevelopment for a 25-year storm of one 24-hour duration (7.5 inches). The engineer shall require submission of required stormwater runoff calculations. 
                  (g)  Retention and detention ponds may be used to retain and detain the increased and accelerated runoff that the development generates. Water shall be released from detention ponds into drainage ways, channels, or lagoons at a rate, in terms of peak flow, not exceeding predevelopment conditions for a 25-year storm of one 24-hour duration (7.5 inches). The purpose of limiting the discharge rate is to prevent exceeding the capacity of downstream drainage facilities. 
                  (h)  The use of wetlands for storing and purifying runoff is strongly encouraged. However, care must be taken not to overload their capacity, thereby harming the wetlands and transitional vegetation. Regulated wetlands shall not be disturbed by the construction of detention ponds in them or sufficiently near to deprive them of required runoff or to lower their normal water table elevation. Adjacent detention ponds that benefit from retention of normal wetland water table elevations are acceptable. If a retention or detention pond is going to be located near a regulated wetland, the applicant will provide data showing that impacts will not be detrimental to the wetland. 
                  (i)  Use of permeable surface materials that will allow for the percolation of rain falling on that surface shall be encouraged in order to reduce runoff volumes. 
                  (j)  Detention and retention ponds shall be designed so that shorelines are meandering where possible, rather than straight, to increase the length of shoreline, thus offering more space for the growth of littoral vegetation for filtering purposes. 
                  (k)  Detention and retention ponds shall be designed to provide at least one foot of vertical detention storage volume for runoff above the proposed dry weather water level design elevation; major drainage canals shall not be used for storage where this may adversely impact the storm hydrology upstream or downstream. Use of rectangular weir outlets will be allowed only where this weir will provide better outlet control needed for a given situation than that provided by a V-notched weir. V-shaped or V-notched weir outlets are recommended to achieve detention storage. Use of innovative outlet structures such as pipe/culvert combinations, perforated riser pipe, or special graduated opening outlet control boxes are encouraged as ways of reproducing predevelopment runoff conditions. Design data for storage volume and detention outlet requirements shall be submitted to and approved by the city prior to final plan approval. 
                  (l)  Detention and retention ponds shall be designed for 25-year sediment loads before the one foot storage volume requirement is included. Sediment storage may be accommodated below the dry weather water level design, as long as an adequate permanent pool depth is maintained. 
                  (m)  Where cleared site conditions exist around detention or retention areas, the banks shall be sloped to the proposed dry weather surface elevation and planted for stabilization purposes. Where slopes are not practical or desired, other methods of bank stabilization will be used and noted on plans submitted for approval. 
                  (n)  Direct stormwater discharges. 
                  (1)  Channeling runoff directly into natural or man-made water-bodies from pipes, curbs, lined channels, hoses, impervious surfaces, rooftops or similar methods shall not be allowed unless methods of filtration are provided. Instead, runoff shall be routed over a longer distance through sheet flow, swales, drywells, or infiltration ditches and other methods to increase percolation, allow suspended solids to settle and remove other pollutants. 
                  (2)  Where specific site hardships may require a variance to allow direct discharge into a downstream water body, the city's approval will be required before a variance is effective. Granting of a variance will be based on unique site hardships and not upon a hardship created by the proposed development plan or financial considerations. 
                  (3)  Where specific site hardships may require a variance to allow direct discharge into a natural waterbody, methods of diffusing and filtering the discharge and of reducing the velocity will be required as approved by the city. 
                  (4)  Discharging collected stormwater from inverted crown streets, roadways, and parking areas directly into manmade waterbodies is discouraged because of its adverse impact on water quality. Use of crowned streets, roadways, and parking areas which allow opportunities for perimeter and subsurface infiltration and for sheet flow through vegetation, grass, gravel, sand, or other filter mediums is strongly encouraged. Where direct discharges from inverted crown paved surfaces into man-made water bodies are proposed, the use of skimming devices, oil, and grease traps, or aquatic vegetation planted in or at the discharge points of the paved surfaces are required to retain oils, greases, and particles. Other filtration methods or techniques approved by the city will be acceptable. 
                  (o)  Dredging, clearing, deepening, widening, straightening, stabilizing, or otherwise altering natural waterbodies may be permitted by the city only when a positive benefit can be demonstrated. Such approval by the city does not obviate the need for state or federal agency approvals where applicable. 
                  (p)  No development will be permitted to construct, establish, maintain, or permanently alter the surface water elevation of any waterbody or wetland that will adversely affect the natural drainage from any upstream or to any downstream areas of the drainage basin. 
                  (q)  The city must approve the water surface elevations proposed for lagoons or waterbodies. The developer will submit sufficient groundwater, topographic elevation data, and hydrologic data on or around the proposed waterbody site to assist in establishing the water surface elevation. 
                  (r)  The city may require as a condition of drainage plan approval that adjustments be made to existing or approved water surface elevations if upstream or downstream areas require such adjustments to provide required drainage flows. 
                  (s)  Channel and pipe flow velocities shall be maintained at a level which minimizes erosion and sediment transport. 
                  (t)  Final landscape designs and plantings shall not work against the stormwater runoff controls and drainage concepts. Landscape design and plantings should further opportunities for percolation, retention, detention, filtration, and plant absorption of site-generated stormwater runoff.

                  Sec. 30-174. - Drainage easements. 
                  (a)  The city shall require as a condition for obtaining approval of runoff control and drainage plans that the applicant record plats and/or covenants insuring that drainage easements and facilities are assigned to a specific entity. Specific entities may include, but are not limited to, the developer, a homeowner's or landowner's association or regime, or the city. If the recording of such covenants or plats is not desired by the applicant, the city will then require, as it deems necessary that the applicant solicit dedication to and acceptance by a specific entity of such easements and facilities to assure the provision, maintenance, and operations of said facilities. All easement and/or covenants shall be recorded and filed in the Cook County Courthouse. 
                  (b)  General maintenance requirements necessary to insure the long-term functions of deeded stormwater runoff controls, easements, and drainage facilities shall also be described in the documents establishing the homeowner's or landowner's association. The documents will also state that the city or legal entity having authority over such drainage may perform or require the homeowner's or landowner's association to take action under the following conditions: 
                  (1)  Normal maintenance is not performed, which results in an adverse affect on drainage flow; 
                  (2)  To alleviate flooding or other emergency drainage problems upstream or downstream of the easement. 
                  The city will assist the developer in negotiating with the homeowner's or landowner's association and other affected parties on equitable distribution of costs incurred in performing or repairing actions taken on these easements under such conditions. 
                  (c)  Underground storm sewer easement. Adequate access for maintenance and improvement of the drainage facility will be required. Generally, for underground storm drain pipes, the minimum width of the easement shall not be less than 15 feet. Additional width may be required by the city based on drainage requirements. Sufficient width as determined by the city will be provided within the easement on one side of the pipe to allow for service equipment mobility and storage of removed fill. 
                  (d)  Open channel easement. For all open drainage channels, the easement shall be equal to the maximum top width of the ditch, plus an additional 15 feet. Additional width may be required by the city based on drainage requirements. Sufficient width as determined by the city will be provided within the easement on one side of the ditch to allow for service equipment mobility and storage of removed fill. 
                  (e)  Drainage easements may be used for other easements with the written approval of the city and with consent of the easement holders. Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the use of drainage easements for access to various properties or other compatible uses with the consent of the landowners and easement holders. 
                  (f)  All storm drainage easements shall be recorded in the Cook County Courthouse and two copies shall be submitted to the city. 
                  (g)  Any development may discharge stormwater runoff in excess of that required to be held on-site into private drainageways provided that the applicant submits written agreements with the downstream owner to receive such discharge from the owners of the bodies, drainage ditches, wetlands, or streams through which such proposed discharge will travel, and approval for such discharge by the city. 
                  (h)  A developer may be required to provide adequate outfall ditches, pipes, and easements downstream from his proposed discharge, if adequate public or private facilities do not exist to carry the proposed discharge.

                  (a)  Prior to submission of an application, the applicant shall meet with the city to determine applicable methodology, existing known drainage conditions, and where existing known drainage problems exist. Cooperative methods shall be sought to resolve deficiencies without adversely affecting the applicant. 
                  (b)  All applicants for plan approval shall submit a site plan and an appropriate scale of all site areas to be covered by impervious surfaces and calculations of pipe, channel, swale, and detention basin sizing.

                  (a)  Applications. Erosion and sedimentation controls shall be required on all sites adjacent to waterbodies or drainageways. The applicant will identify erosion and sediment control measure between the disturbed areas and adjacent waterbodies or drainage way on plans submitted for plan approval. 
                  (b)  Existing uncovered areas. 
                  (1)  Any site which has been substantially denuded of vegetation, and which is not in an active phase of development for more than 30 days, shall have functioning erosion and sediment control measures in place and shall be seeded or planted with an acceptable ground cover material. 
                  (2)  The city will serve upon any landowner, by certified mail, written notice to comply with provisions of this article. The notice will reference the requirements of this article, will set forth the measures needed to comply, and will state a time within which such measures must be completed. In determining the measures required and the time allowed for compliance, the city shall take into consideration the economic feasibility, technology, and quantity of work required, and shall set reasonable and attainable time limits for compliance. 
                  (3)  The city shall have the authority to require preparation and approval of an erosion and sedimentation control plan in any instance where extensive control measures are needed as a result of proposed development plans near water courses or waterbodies. 
                  (c)  Ground cover requirements. To help retain sediment generated by land-disturbing development activities within the boundaries of the development tract, all developers shall plant or otherwise provide a permanent ground cover by "hydromulching" sufficient to restrain erosion after completion of construction or development.

                  Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on a community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet, and/or where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. 
                  Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. In the absence of official designation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, areas of special flood hazard shall be those designated by the local community and referenced in section 38-7. 
                  Base flood, means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.

                  Basement means that portion of a building having its floor sub grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
                  Building, means any structure built for support, shelter, or enclosure for any occupancy or storage. 
                  Critical facility means any public or private facility, which, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the disaster or would increase the hazard to life and health. Critical facilities include: 
                  (1)  Structures or facilities that produce, use, or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic, or water-reactive materials;

                  Existing construction means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before September 1, 1977. [the effective date of the initial FIRM for that community]. 
                  Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before September 1, 1977. [the effective date of the FIRST floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
                  Existing to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed, including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads. 
                  Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
                  (1)  The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or

                  Flood insurance study the official report by the Federal Insurance Administration evaluating flood hazards and containing flood profiles and water surface elevations of the base flood. 
                  Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
                  Flood proofing, means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
                  Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
                  Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
                  Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, adjacent to the proposed foundation of a building. 
                  Historic structure means any structure that is:

                  b.  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
                  Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this code. 
                  Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
                  Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
                  Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
                  National geodetic vertical datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
                  New construction means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after September 1, 1977 [the effective date of the initial FIRM] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced after September 1, 1977 [the effective date of the FIRST floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community] and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
                  New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed after September 1, 1977. [the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community]. 
                  North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 in existing and future FEMA Flood Modernization Maps. 
                  Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, which is: 
                  (1)  Built on a single chassis;

                  (4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
                  Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
                  Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
                  Subdivision the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
                  Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
                  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, taking place during a 5-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
                  For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
                  Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
                  Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
                  Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

                  Sec. 38-2. - Statutory authorization. 
                  Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Adel, Georgia, does ordain as follows: 
                  (Ord. No. 09-11, Art. 1, § A, 8-17-09) 
                  Sec. 38-3. - Findings of fact. 
                  (a)  The flood hazard areas of Adel, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
                  (b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
                  (Ord. No. 09-11, Art. 1, § B, 8-17-09) 
                  Sec. 38-4. - Statement of purpose. 
                  It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
                  (1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
                  (2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
                  (3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion, and; 
                  (4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
                  (5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
                  (Ord. No. 09-11, Art. 1, § C, 8-17-09) 
                  Sec. 38-5. - Objectives.

                  (c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city council may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Cook County, as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
                  (d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
                  (e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this Article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
                  (f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
                  (g)  In reviewing such requests, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
                  (h)  Conditions for variances: 
                  (1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
                  a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
                  b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
                  c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
                  (2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
                  (3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
                  (4)  The planning and zoning administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
                  (i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

                  ARTICLE III. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

                  Sec. 38-51. - General standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure; 
                  (2)  New construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
                  (3)  New construction or substantial improvements of existing structures shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
                  (4)  Elevated buildings. All new construction or substantial improvements of existing structures that include any fully enclosed area located below the lowest floor formed by foundation and other exterior walls shall be designed so as to be an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure. The enclosure shall be designed to equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
                  a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
                  1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
                  2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
                  3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 
                  b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this ordinance, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
                  c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
                  (5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
                  (6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable State requirements for resisting wind forces. 
                  (7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system; 
                  (8)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters; 
                  (9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding, and; 
                  (10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure, which is not complaint with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if the non-conformity is not furthered, extended or replaced.

                  Sec. 38-52. - Specific standards. 
                  In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
                  (1)  New construction and/or substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 38-51(4), "Elevated buildings." 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  (2)  Non-residential construction. New construction and/or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1—30, AE, or AH zones, may be flood-proofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 38-33(6). 
                  (3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
                  a.  All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home parks or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
                  b.  Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
                  1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
                  2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
                  c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection 38-51(6) above) 
                  d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
                  1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
                  2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
                  3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "New Construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsection 38-52(3)a.—c., above. 
                  (4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-7, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
                  a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
                  b.  Only if subsection 38-52(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article III.

                  Sec. 38-53. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
                  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 38-7, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-Zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a Floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
                  (1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 38-7, then the planning and zoning administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of Article III. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (subsections 38-53(2) and (3) shall apply: 
                  (2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
                  (3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A-Zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 38-51(4) "Elevated buildings." 
                  a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
                  The planning and zoning administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

                  ARTICLE II. - CURFEW FOR MINORS 

                  Sec. 50-21. - Findings; public purpose. 
                  (a)  The city council hereby finds and determines as a matter of fact that the City of Adel is facing a mounting crisis created by crimes committed by juvenile offenders and crimes committed against juvenile victims. 
                  (b)  This council further finds that persons under the age of 17 are particularly susceptible by their lack of maturity and experience to participate in unlawful activities and/or to place themselves in situations which would increase their potential for victimization. 
                  (c)  This council further finds that a need exists for increased parental control over the activities of juveniles. 
                  (d)  This council further finds that this criminal activity, both individually and collectively, presents a clear and present danger to the citizenry and to public order and safety and that an ordinance establishing a curfew for persons under the age of 17 and parental responsibility for violations of said curfew is an appropriate method of addressing the foregoing issues. 
                  (e)  Therefore, the purpose of this article is as follows: 
                  (1)  To protect juveniles and other citizens from the dangers of crimes which occur on sidewalks, streets, and in public and semi-public places during late night and early morning hours; 
                  (2)  To decrease the amount of criminal activity committed by juveniles; and 
                  (3)  To promote and enhance parental control over juveniles.
