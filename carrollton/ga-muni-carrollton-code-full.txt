PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Carrollton, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1975 Code, as supplemented through January 2009, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1975 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

Further, the granting of partial payment on the annual taxes of any such taxpayer is in no wise to restrict the Mayor and City Councilmen as to levy of assessment made for any year, it is only to enable the taxpayer to make prepayment and have an accounting on the payment of the final assessment when the rate has been duly fixed and the tax receipts properly issued, at which time the taxpayer shall have the right to have credited on his annual tax receipt such prepayment if any has been made. Be it further enacted that all taxes shall be declared to be due the said City on the 20th day of December of each year and shall bear interest at the rate of seven per centum (7%) per annum from said date if not paid. It shall be the duty of the Clerk to issue tax fi. fas. on all taxes not paid on said date and on the first day of January of the succeeding year to deliver all said tax fi. fas. which have been issued for taxes so due said City to the Marshal of said City for collection, including the cost of fi. fas. fifty cents (50¢) each. All of said tax fi. fas. so issued and delivered to the Marshal shall be delivered under written receipt from the Marshal, setting forth the name of each taxpayer, and the amount of taxes due thereon, and when said tax fi. fas. are so delivered the receipt for said fi. fas. so delivered shall be signed by the said Marshal and kept on file in the Clerk's office and there remain. When each of said tax fi. fas. are paid and delivered it shall be the duty of the Marshal to make a return to the Clerk's office of the amount so collected, at which time the Clerk should credit, mark, or cancel said name from the list of unpaid tax fi. fas. held in his office. Be if further enacted, that the Marshal, or any other officer to whom said tax fi. fas. have been delivered shall within seventy days thereof make a written report to the Mayor and City Councilmen on each of said fi. fas. in his hands, showing all collections on any and all fi. fas. that shall be turned over to him and he shall make weekly written reports thereafter to the Clerk of the Mayor and City Council of Carrollton which shall be kept on file in the Clerk's office.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 6-1. - Findings and public purpose. 
(a)  Based on the experience of other counties and municipalities including, but not limited to, Atlanta and Fulton County, Georgia; which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the city, and based on the evidence and testimony of the citizens and public safety officials who have appeared before us, we take note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality. Moreover, it is the finding of the mayor and city council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages begets criminal behavior and tends to create behavior identified with nudity, disorderly conduct, prostitution, drug trafficking and drug use. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depreciation of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order and increased burdens on the judicial system. Therefore, the restriction of adult uses and adult entertainment in restaurants wherein alcohol is authorized to be consumed on the premises is in the public welfare and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide adult entertainment or adult uses. 
(b)  Pursuant to the vote of the citizens of the city authorizing the sale of distilled spirits by the drink for consumption on the premises in bona fide eating establishments and pursuant to the vote of the citizens of the city authorizing the sale of distilled spirits by the package and in accordance with a plan designed for the purposes, among others, of promoting the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city: 
(1)  To establish reasonable standards for the regulation and control of the licensing and sale of alcoholic beverages; 
(2)  To protect and preserve schools, churches, and similar places of public assembly; and 
(3)  To preserve residential areas regarding, among other things, the character of the areas, their particular suitability for particular uses and the congestion in the surrounding roads and streets, with a general view of promoting desirable living conditions, and sustaining the stability of neighborhood and property values. 
(c)  Consistent with the previous actions of the mayor and city council limiting malt beverage and wine sales by the drink for consumption on the premises ancillary to the primary business of serving food prepared on the premises, it is also the finding, intent and policy of the mayor and city council that the issuance of any alcoholic beverage license for consumption on the premises under this chapter shall be strictly limited to bona fide eating establishments which shall be either restaurants, supper clubs, private clubs, or alcoholic beverage caterers or breweries as defined in this chapter and which meet all applicable requirements of the same. 
(d)  It is also the finding, intent and policy of the mayor and city council that the issuance of any alcoholic beverage license for the sale of distilled spirits by the package shall be strictly limited to the terms and conditions of this chapter. 
(e)  It is expressly not the intent of the mayor and city council to permit the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises in nightclubs, bars, pubs, dancehalls, pool halls, gamerooms or any other establishment not qualifying as a bona fide eating establishment either as a restaurant, supper club, private club, or alcoholic beverage caterer or brewery as defined in this chapter. 
(f)  It is further the stated directive of the mayor and city council that the authority to issue, renew and administer licenses for consumption on the premises and for the sale of distilled spirits by the package granted to the city manager shall be discharged in accordance with this finding. 
(Amd. of 12-6-04; Res. No. 12-2016, Exh. A, 6-6-16) 
Sec. 6-2. - Purposes. 
(a)  The purposes of this chapter shall include, without necessarily being limited to, the following: 
(1)  Compliance with and effectuation of the general state law; 
(2)  Prevention and control of the sale of alcoholic beverages by unfit persons; 
(3)  Insuring that any licenses issued for the consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises are issued only to a legitimate restaurant, supper club, private club, alcoholic beverage caterer, or brewery; 
(4)  Insuring that the issuance of any alcoholic beverage license for the sale of distilled spirits by the package is strictly limited to terms and conditions of this chapter; 
(5)  The protection of schools, homes, churches, parks, and other institutions; and 
(6)  Protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. 
(b)  To the maximum extent permissible under state and federal law, the business of selling alcoholic beverages shall under this chapter be considered to be a privilege to be accorded in conformity with the foregoing and other public policies of the city, rather than a right. 
(Amd. of 12-6-04; Res. No. 12-2016, Exh. A, 6-6-16)

Sec. 22-58. - Application of article to prior ordinance.

Editor's note— Res. No. 12-2011, adopted Feb. 6, 2012, repealed the former Div. 1, §§ 22-106—22-110, and enacted a new Div. 1 as set out herein. The former Div. 1 was entitled "Generally" and derived from Code 1975, §§ 13-95—13-98; and Res. No. 03-2010, adopted July 12, 2010. 

Sec. 22-106. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this division is to protect, maintain, and enhance the public health, safety, and general welfare by regulating peddling, itinerant traders, and other door-to-door salesmen, generally known as peddlers. Such persons typically market magazines, appliances, house wares, and other goods and services by going door to door in neighborhoods and business districts. The citizens of the City of Carrollton, Georgia, are subject to unregulated peddling by sometimes questionable organizations or individuals, with illegitimate products, or no intent to deliver. It is the purpose of this division to regulate peddling in the City of Carrollton, Georgia, to protect the public health, safety and welfare. To achieve this end, this division requires peddlers to seek licenses and peddle under certain limitations. It also allows for the Chief of Police of Carrollton, Georgia, in his or her discretion, to conduct background checks on peddlers. However, it is not the intent of this division to require legitimate sales representatives, visiting businesses or persons they have already made appointments with or already have a legitimate business relationship with, to need licensing. Neither is it the intent of this division to infringe free speech rights or require licensing for persons going door-to-door for political campaigns, religious proselytizing, or other free speech reasons.

The county tax commissioner shall collect and enforce municipal liens imposed pursuant to this article in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-5-359.1. The county tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the municipality. 
(i)  Enforcement of liens pursuant to this Code section may be initiated at any time following receipt by the county tax commissioner of the final determination of costs in accordance with this article.

An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this article.

(Ord. of 8-4-97, § 2.5; Amd. of 6-18-01; Memo. of 9-7-10) 
Sec. 94-86. - City of Carrollton right of revision. 
The City of Carrollton reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW. 
(Ord. of 8-4-97, § 2.6) 
Sec. 94-87. - Dilution. 
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The designated city representative may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 
(Ord. of 8-4-97, § 2.7) 
Sec. 94-88. - Conventional pollutants. 
The conventional pollutants, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD 5 ), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and oil and grease are controlled in order to prevent overloading of the treatment plant's ability to supply oxygen, digest and remove solids, and remove oil and grease. Ordinance limits of 100 mg/l for oil and grease have evolved from years of experience in actual operations, and are limits that have empirically been found to be effective in protecting the treatment works. 
Industrial discharge limits for BOD 5 and TSS are derived from the total plant design capabilities with an allowance for dilution from normal domestic wastewater. The plant was designed to handle average influent BOD 5 and TSS loadings of 230 mg/l. Average domestic components of wastewater typically include 220 mg/l BOD 5 and TSS. Industrial users are estimated to contribute approximately 30 percent of the total flow (currently 1.683 MGD industrial / 5.630 total = 29.89 percent), and are allowed to discharge up to 250 mg/l BOD 5 and TSS without surcharge. A surcharge is applied to user charges for wastewater strengths in excess of 250 mg/l BOD 5 or TSS to discourage industries from discharging high strength wastes. The surcharge is a very effective mechanism for achieving voluntary compliance, and the industries in the city rarely pay surcharges. A prohibition Limit of 500 mg/l for BOD5 and TSS is in place to guard against a single industry discharging extremely high strength waste and potentially disrupting the treatment process. Fines and other sanctions are applied if prohibition limits are exceeded. Surcharge limits are derived as follows: 
Ind. BOD (Ind. Flow) + Dom. BOD (Domestic Flow) = Total BOD (Total Flow) 
Allowable Industrial BOD = Total BOD (Total Flow) - Dom BOD (Dom Flow)                                              Ind. Flow 
Allowable Industrial BOD = 230(7.0) - 220(0.7)(7.0) = 253                                 0.3(7.0) 
Use: Allowable BOD 5 and TSS concentrations = 250 mg/l 
The city wastewater treatment facilities have been designed to handle an average influent ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 N) concentration of 38 mg/l. Since land application is used for disposal of the entire plant effluent, ammonia nitrogen is not controlled by the plant operating permit. Actual experience has shown that the existing ordinance surcharge limit of 20 mg/l and prohibition limit of 50 mg/l for ammonia nitrogen have been effective in a protecting plant operations against upset.

Sec. 94-251. - Upset. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (c), below, are met. 
(c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the user can identity the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3)  The user has submitted the following information to the designated city representative within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
d.  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
e.  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
f.  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(Ord. of 8-4-97, § 12.1) 
Sec. 94-252. - Prohibited discharge standards. 
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 94-81(2)c. through g. of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the City of Carrollton was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

Sec. 94-253. - Bypass. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section: 
(1)  "Bypass" means the international diversion of waste streams from any portion of the user's treatment facility. 
(2)  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  (1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the designated city representative, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the designated city representative of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The designated city representative may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d)  (1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the designated city representative may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (c) of this section. 
(2)  The designated city representative may approve a bypass, after considering its adverse effects, or if the designated city representative determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

DIVISION 13. - SURCHARGES 

Sec. 94-266. - [Generally.] 
In addition to normal rates, charges and fees, surcharges shall be levied for wastewater with strengths in excess of the permitted limits. These limits are: Chemical oxygen demand (COD) 500 (mg/l) and/or total suspended solids (TSS) of 250 (mg/l) based on flow composites. This surcharge reflects the increased operation and maintenance costs and other increased expenses incurred in the treatment of wastewater with strengths in excess of permitted limits. 
The surcharge is calculated as follows: 
(1)  COD surcharge: 
COD Factor = (Actual COD - Allowed COD) / (Allowed) ×.65* 
COD Surcharge = (COD Factor) × (Sewer Rate) × (Units Used) 
(2)  TSS surcharge: 
TSS Factor = (Actual TSS - Allowed TSS) / (Allowed TSS) ×.35** 
TSS Surcharge = (TSS Factor) × (Sewer Rate) × (Units Used) 
*65 percent of the treatment effort goes to COD/BOD removal 
**35 percent of the treatment effort goes to TSS removal

(Res. No. 09-2011, 9-12-11) 
3.01.02 - Findings of Fact 
A.  The flood hazard areas of Carrollton, Georgia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Res. No. 09-2011, 9-12-11) 
3.01.03 - Statement of Purpose 
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
A.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
B.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
C.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
D.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
E.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(Res. No. 09-2011, 9-12-11)

B.  The Mayor and City Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Floodplain Coordinator in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance. 
C.  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Mayor and City Council may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Carroll County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
D.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of Historic Structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a Historic Structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
E.  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this ordinance are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
F.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if ANY increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
G.  In reviewing such requests, the Mayor and City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this ordinance and the following: 
a.  Danger that material may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
b.  Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
c.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
d.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
e.  Necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility; 
f.  Availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
g.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
h.  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
i.  Safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
j.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
k.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
H.  Conditions for Variances: 
a.  A variance shall be issued ONLY when there is: 
i.  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
ii.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and 
iii.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
b.  The provisions of this Ordinance are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a Historic Structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
c.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
d.  The Floodplain Coordinator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
I.  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the Mayor and City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance.

NOTE: The market value of the structure should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the Code Enforcement Official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
"Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions" is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
"Variance" is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance. 
"Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

3.02.00 - WATER RESOURCE DISTRICTS 

3.02.01 - Purpose 
The intent of this article is to establish minimum development standards and criteria, which will afford reasonable protection of environmentally sensitive natural resources found throughout the City. Based on the findings of the City Comprehensive Plan, it has been determined that the wise management of these resources as defined in this article is essential to maintaining the health, safety, general welfare and economic well being of the public. 
3.02.02 - Establishment of Water Resource Districts 
A.  The water resource districts shall include the following: 
1.  Groundwater recharge area district; 
2.  Wetlands district; 
3.  Water supply watershed district; and 
4.  River corridor protection district. 
B.  The boundaries of these water resource districts are shown on a set of maps designated as water resource districts and are included as part of this article which are on file with the City Manager's office located at 315 Bradley Street, Carrollton, Georgia. 
C.  These water resource districts are established measures to guide future growth and development in environmentally sensitive areas. Because these protective measures allow some latitude with land uses and because these districts are not intended to prescribe a specific land use but rather to define the range of acceptable land uses, these districts are designated as overlay districts. 
3.02.03 - Definitions 
Definitions for the following section are located in Article 1 of this UDO. 
3.02.04 - Groundwater Recharge Area District 
A.  Findings of fact. 
1.  Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. 
2.  Pesticides, herbicides sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. 
3.  Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. 
4.  Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
B.  Purpose. The purpose of this district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures.

2.  In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; natural resource education; scientific study; and recreation opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well being of many communities within the state. 
3.  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. 
4.  Piece meal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. 
5.  Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
B.  Purpose. 
1.  The purpose of this district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas. 
2.  This ordinance is to promote wetland protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreation and aesthetic values. 
3.  Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practical as determined through the permitting process. 
C.  District delineation. 
1.  These regulations shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the City. 
2.  The wetland district overlay map, adopted as part of this article, shows the general location of wetlands, according to the 1987 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps. 
3.  These maps shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands maps and are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto. 
4.  The generalized wetlands maps do not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the City and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. 
5.  No local government action under this ordinance relieves the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
D.  Wetland development permit requirements. 
1.  No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the City. 
2.  If the area proposed for development is located near or in close proximity to a wetland protection district boundary, as determined by the zoning administrator, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. 
3.  If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a Section 404 permit or a letter of permission is issued. 
E.  Permitted uses. 
The following uses are permitted by right within the wetland district to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging except as provided herein. The activities listed in this section are exempted from Section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual Section 404 permit. However, under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances: 
1.  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in the Clean Water Act. 
2.  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish or other wildlife, provided the conservation or preservation does not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual Section 404 permit. 
3.  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
4.  Natural water quality treatment or purification. 
5.  Normal agriculture activities including the planting and harvesting of crops and pasturing of livestock. Such activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state Department of Agriculture. 
F.  Prohibited uses. 
The following uses are prohibited in a wetland district: 
1.  Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants. 
2.  Hazardous or sanitary landfills. 
3.02.07 - Water Supply Watershed District 
A.  Findings of fact. 
1.  In order to provide for the health, safety, welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the City and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. 
2.  The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted urban and suburban development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. 
3.  In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated, expensive and rendering water resources unusable. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby drinking water supplies. 
B.  Purpose. 
1.  The purpose of this section is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply for the City, which will minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply, and maintain the yield of the water supply watersheds. 
2.  This article shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the City. 
C.  District delineation. 
The City's water supply watershed district is hereby designated, and shall comprise the land areas, which drain to the City's water supply intake on the Little Tallapoosa River. The ridgelines of the respective watersheds and the boundary of a radius seven (7) miles upstream of the respective water supply intake define the boundary of this district. This district shall be further delineated and defined on the water resource district map of the City, which is hereby incorporated and made a part of this article by reference. The following water supply watershed districts and reservoirs are hereby defined and boundaries shall be identified on the water resource district map: 
1.  Existing large water supply watersheds. There are none at the present time. 
2.  Existing small water supply watersheds. The Little Tallapoosa River Watershed from the City's intake, encompassing a 97 square mile area. An intake for the City is located on this river. This water supply watershed contains three (3) reservoirs (see the table below) either owned in whole or in part by the City, all of which are covered in City's DNR approved reservoir management plan dated June 1992. Because the three (3) reservoirs were placed in use at different times over the past forty (40) years, use restrictions and buffer requirements vary for each reservoir. 
Table 3.02.07 (C), Little Tallapoosa River Watershed Reservoirs. 

 
3.  Future water supply watersheds. There are no planned large or small future water supply watersheds at the present time within the City limits of the City. 
D.  Permitted uses. 
The following regulations shall apply to the Little Tallapoosa Water Supply Watershed, which is identified on the water resource district map. All uses, which are lawful at the time of adoption of this article, shall be allowed to continue as lawful land uses until such time as the use is abandoned, as defined in this UDO for nonconforming uses. All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts as established by this article and county ordinances, except those listed below in prohibited uses, are permitted in the water supply watershed district, subject to the following conditions and standards:

2.  No impervious surface shall be constructed within a 75-foot setback on both sides of all perennial streams as measured from the stream bank. 
3.  Septic tanks and septic tank drainfields are prohibited in the setback area of subsection (1)(b)(2) above. 
2.  Reservoir management plan criteria. 
a.  Prohibitions or restrictions on all or some of the following recreational uses (swimming, fishing, boating, docks, and public access) are addressed in the City's DNR-approved reservoir management plan dated June 1992. These restrictions were developed to protect the water quality of the three reservoirs for drinking purposes while optimizing their recreational benefits. 
b.  Because the three reservoirs were placed in use at different times over the past forty years, use restrictions and buffer requirements vary for each reservoir. 
c.  All new reservoirs shall have a buffer for a distance of 150 feet from the reservoir boundary and shall have prohibitions or restrictions on all or some of the recreational uses listed above, to protect the water quality for drinking purposes. 
d.  At such time in the future, if the land use changes at Lake Carroll result in a more concentrated use of the lake, then the City will address imposing more restrictive recreational measures in order to continue to preserve the water quality of the reservoir.

3.04.04 - Minimum Requirements for Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Using Best Management Practices 
A.  General Provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (B) and (C) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES General Permit. 
B.  Minimum Requirements/BMPs. 
1.  Best management practices as set forth in sections (B) and (C) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the City Engineer or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
2.  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a Local Issuing Authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the Director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
3.  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the City or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
4.  The City Engineer may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
5.  The Local Issuing Authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in C.15. and 16., in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
C.  Additional Requirements. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land- disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
1.  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
2.  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
3.  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
4.  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
5.  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
6.  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
7.  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
8.  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
9.  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
10.  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
11.  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
12.  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
13.  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
14.  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (B)(2) of this section; 
15.  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the City Engineer determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the City Engineer pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 5, art. 5, pt. 6, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the City Engineer as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (1) Stream crossings for water lines; or (2) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
16.  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to O.C.G.A. tit. 12, ch. 5, art. 2, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the Board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The City Engineer may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (1) Stream crossings for water lines; or (2) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
D.  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any City from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsection (B) and (C) of this section. 
E.  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(Res. No. 01-2014, 2-3-14) 
3.04.05 - Application/Permit Process

They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this ordinance, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City. However, the operator is the only party who may obtain a permit. 
B.  Application Requirements. 
1.  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Carrollton, GA, without first obtaining a permit from the City to perform such activity and providing a copy of Notice of Intent submitted to EPD, as applicable. 
2.  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City Engineer and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (C) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsection (B) and (C) of this section will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. Additional copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans may also be submitted directly to EPD, as specified by the City Engineer. 
3.  The City of Carrollton assesses local permitting fees and also state-mandated fees. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. Except as otherwise provided for herein, fees for an application for a permit on a per-acre of land disturbed basis, as required by this article, shall be as established by the City of Carrollton from time to time by resolution of the City Council. In addition to the local permitting fees, state-mandated fees shall also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), and regulations adopted thereunder by EPD, in the amount of $80.00 per disturbed acre, to be divided as follows: $40.00 per acre to the City and $40.00 per acre to the EPD. In the case of a subdivision or other larger common plan of development or sale, "per disturbed acre" includes all acreage to be disturbed in the entire development. Fees for the City shall be submitted to the City including primary and secondary permittees. Fees for the state shall be submitted to the state on EPD forms available at http://www.gaepd.org.

No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the District, and any variances required by Section 3.04.04 (C)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per this section, have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the City and the District enter into an agreement which allows the City to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the District. 
5.  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this ordinance section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the City may deny the permit application. 
6.  The City shall require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the City may call the bond to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. The City Manager may release a portion of the letter of credit, for the land-disturbing amount, after final stabilization is complete and all permanent vegetation and stabilization measures are in place. If the permit holder believes they are not in violation of this article such that the surety should not be drawn against, the permit holder may appeal any notice to comply to the City of Carrollton. Appeal shall be made by filing a written notice of appeal within five days of any notice to comply with the City Manager stating the basis for the appeal. The City Council shall consider the appeal at the next scheduled public meeting. Except in emergency situations, the surety shall not be drawn against until the appeal is considered. The decision of the City Council shall be final. 
C.  Plan Requirements. 
1.  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in sections 3.04.04 (B) and (C) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices.

5.  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the City, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
6.  The City may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
(Res. No. 01-2014, 2-3-14) 
3.04.06 - Inspection and Enforcement 
A.  The City Engineer or his or her designee will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the City shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed.

4.07.00 - LANDSCAPING, BUFFERS, AND TREE PROTECTION 

4.07.01 - Purpose 
The City deems it necessary and desirable in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare to enact an ordinance for the conservation, planting and replacement of trees in the City without denying the reasonable use and enjoyment of real property. The importance of trees is recognized for their shade, cooling, noise and wind reduction, soil erosion prevention, oxygen production, dust filtration, carbon dioxide absorption, aesthetic and economic enhancement of all real property, and their contribution to the general well being and quality of life of the citizens of Carrollton. Consistent with the expressed purpose of this title, all persons shall make reasonable efforts to preserve and retain certain existing, self-supporting trees. It is also the intent of this article that all applicable sites within the city maintain a minimum tree canopy, as defined and described herein. 
4.07.02 - Applicability and Provision of Landscape Plans 
A.  Applicability. New developments and existing developments adding structural or site improvements and developments requiring preliminary plats, and developments for which a land development/Land-disturbance permit is required, shall be subject to the provisions of this article. 
B.  Landscape plans. A plan showing required buffers, tree canopy, and landscaping shall be submitted in support of a site plan or building permit. All landscaping plans for buffers and related areas shall include the following information: 
1.  The location, varieties, number and size of plantings to be planted within the development; 
2.  Topographic information showing the final site grading and drainage for the landscape area; 
3.  Impervious surfaces, including sidewalks, pavement areas and building footprints; 
4.  Total tree canopy calculation by percent provided by both existing and proposed trees. See Appendix A, the City of Carrollton Tree Species table, to calculate tree canopy by percent; 
[5.]  Buffer areas; 
[6.]  Specimen Trees; and 
7.  Property lines. 
4.07.03 - Maintenance Requirements 
The applicant, property owner and/or subsequent or successor owners and their agents shall be responsible for maintenance of any landscaping and any landscaped buffer on the property on a continuing basis for the life of the development. 
A.  Maintenance. All required landscaping shall be maintained in a neat and orderly manner at all times. This shall include, but not be limited to, mowing, edging, pruning, fertilizing, watering, weeding and other activities common to the maintenance of landscaping. Landscaped areas shall be kept free of trash, litter, weeds and other materials or plants not part of the landscaping. Failure to maintain landscape areas shall be considered a violation of this UDO. 
B.  Plant material. All required plant material shall be maintained in a healthy, growing condition as is appropriate for the season. Plant materials that exhibit evidence of insect pests, disease and/or damage shall be appropriately treated, and dead plants promptly removed and replaced within the next planting season. 
C.  Pruning. All tree pruning on public property shall conform to the ANSI A300 standards or other best management practices for tree care. 
D.  Tree topping. It shall be unlawful for any person or firm to top or severely prune any street tree, park tree, or other tree on public property. Topping is defined as the severe cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than three inches in diameter within the tree's crown to such a degree so as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Severe pruning seriously affects the tree's food supply, can scald the newly exposed bark, make trees vulnerable to insect invasion, stimulate the regrowth of dense, upright branches below the pruning cut, make the tree more vulnerable to wind damage, disfigure the tree aesthetically, and sometimes result in the death of the tree. Where appropriate, crown reduction by a qualified arborist may be substituted. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees under obstructions such as utility wires where other pruning practices are impractical may be exempted from this provision. 
E.  Maintenance bond required. For new developments, a two-year maintenance bond shall, unless waived by the City Manager, be required for all maintained landscaping. 
4.07.04 - Tree Canopy Requirements 
It is the goal of the City of Carrollton to achieve and maintain tree canopy cover and to promote the functional distribution of that canopy throughout and within the established zoning districts as development occurs through goals and requirements for tree canopy cover. 
A.  Minimum total tree canopy requirements. New developments and existing developments adding structural or site improvements and developments requiring preliminary plats, and developments for which a land development/Land-disturbance permit is required, shall provide at least a minimum amount of tree canopy cover as shown in Table 4.07.04(C). Existing single family residential lots that appear on a preliminary plat approved prior to the adoption of this UDO are exempt. 
B.  Minimum conserved tree canopy cover requirement. On lots equal or greater than 12,500 square feet in gross acreage a minimum amount of tree canopy cover shall originate from tree conservation as shown in Table 4.07.04(C). Trees within forested areas, open space, buffers, stormwater retention and detention areas and facilities, parks and open areas, passive recreation areas, 100-year floodplain, jurisdictional wetlands, and other similar forested areas shall count toward the minimum conserved tree canopy cover requirement if they meet the definition of a conservable tree or trees. All tree conservation shall be accomplished with the tree protection standards set forth in Section 4.07.07. 
C.  Tree canopy cover required by zoning district. The amount of tree canopy cover required as measured in percent of total gross acreage of the site or lot varies by zoning district. Canopy calculations by species is specified in Appendix A in the City of Carrollton Tree Species table. Table 4.07.04(C) contains the minimum tree canopy cover required according to the zoning district. On new single family residential subdivisions, tree canopy cover is required for the overall site, as well as for each individual lot. Tree canopy cover required for each lot may be counted toward the tree canopy cover required for the entire site. The tree canopy cover located in the adjacent public right-of-way may be applied to the individual lot and overall tree canopy requirements. 
Table 4.07.04 (C) Tree Canopy Requirements by Zoning District 

 
1.  See Section 4.07.07 for tree protection measures for conserved trees. 
2.  No more than [thirty] (30) percent of any one tree species shall be planted on a lot. 
3.  Lots that do not contain any pre-development tree canopy are not subject to the conserved tree canopy requirement. 
4.  The City Manager may administratively waive or reduce the tree canopy percentage for those properties in a multifamily redevelopment overlay district. 
(Res. No. 05-2014, 5-5-14; Res. No. 06-2019, 2-4-19; Res. No. 08-2019, 2-4-19) 
4.07.05 - Buffer Standards 
A.  Buffers required. When any nonresidential use, other than agricultural uses, abuts a residential zoning district or when multi-family residences are adjacent to single-family residences or districts or subdivisions, one of the following buffers types shall be installed on the lot with the more intensive or nonresidential use along common lot lines. 
B.  Buffer types. 
a.  Natural buffers. A strip at least 50 feet wide, having existing natural growth equivalent to a densely planted evergreen screen. Planning staff may require additional planting to achieve a uniform buffer strip. 
b.  Landscape buffers. A strip at least 20 feet wide, densely planted with an appropriate mix of trees and shrubs at least three feet high at the time of planting, of a type that will possess growth characteristics of such a nature as to produce a dense, compact evergreen screen capable of growing at least six feet within three years. 
c.  Landscape buffer with fence structure. A buffer strip at least 10 feet wide, containing an opaque fence or barrier at least six feet in height. The wall or fence shall have at least five feet of landscape plantings on the exterior side of the wall and shall be planted with appropriate trees, shrubs, and ground cover as to provide a transition from the wall to both edges of the buffer strip. Planning staff may require additional plantings to acquire a uniform buffer strip. 
4.07.06 - Landscaping Design Standards 
A.  Site selection standards. Trees shall be placed such that they have adequate space to grow unobstructed to maturity. Minimum distances, at the time of planting as measured from the tree trunk to structures and infrastructure shall be required as listed in the table below. Staff may reduce these distance requirements as necessary if the growth of the tree will not be inhibited. 
Table 4.07.06(A). Minimum Distances in Feet Required Between Trees and Structures or Infrastructure by Tree Canopy Size 

 
B.  Landscaping requirements. Each project shall provide the amount of landscaping required by use as set forth in the table below. These percentages of landscaping are required for all properties that require a Land-disturbance permit. 
Table 4.07.06(B). Landscaping Requirements 

 
1.  Landscaped areas shall include all areas that are planted. Areas retained in a natural state may be included if they are comprised of native or non-invasive species.

5.04.04.1 - Signs in the Lake Carroll Village Overlay 
Signage is vital in the area encompassed by the Lake Carroll Village Overlay. While functioning primarily as a communication tool, signs can also contribute to the unique character of an area. The area encompassed by the Lake Carroll Village Overlay has a diverse mix of pole, monument, wall, temporary, and dilapidated signage. The intent of the sign design standards in the Lake Carroll Village Overlay is: (i) to encourage excellence in signage, both as a communication tool and as an art form; (ii) to allow and encourage creative and unique sign designs while preventing cluttered and unattractive streetscapes; and (iii) to provide basic parameters for creative signs that may be varied and unique like the businesses they represent. 
Effectively designed signage should respond to the site, landscape, and architectural design context within which they are located. Signs should be compatible in scale, proportion, and design with the building's facade and its surroundings. These standards do not dictate design. 
The sign standards for the Lake Carroll Village Overlay address the following: (i) appropriate locations; (ii) number of signs allowed on a property; (iii) maximum area for individual signs; (iv) height limitation; (v) color and materials; (vi) lighting; (vii) temporary signage (both on-site and off-site); (viii) off-site signs; and (ix) dilapidated or abandoned signage.

5.04.04.2 - Signs in the Maple Street Overlay 
Signage is vital in the area encompassed by the Maple Street Overlay. While functioning primarily as a communication tool, signs can also contribute to the unique character of an area. The area encompassed by the Maple Street Overlay has a diverse mix of pole, monument, wall, temporary, and dilapidated signage. The intent of the sign design standards in the Maple Street Overlay is: (i) to encourage excellence in signage, both as a communication tool and as an art form; (ii) to allow and encourage creative and unique sign designs while preventing cluttered and unattractive streetscapes; and (iii) to provide basic parameters for creative signs that may be varied and unique like the businesses they represent. 
Effectively designed signage should respond to the site, landscape, and architectural design context within which they are located. Signs should be compatible in scale, proportion, and design with the building's façade and its surroundings. These standards do not dictate design. 
The sign standards for the Maple Street Overlay address the following: (i) appropriate locations; (ii) number of signs allowed on a property; (iii) maximum area for individual signs; (iv) height limitation; (v) color and materials; (vi) lighting; (vii) temporary signage (both on-site and off-site); (viii) off-site signs; and (ix) dilapidated or abandoned signage.

Any vegetation that constitutes part of the buffer or landscaping shall be replaced in the event it dies. 
D.  Aesthetics, placement, materials, and color. 
1.  Attached WCFs shall have both antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment that are of a neutral color identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. In addition, the placement of the antenna array and supporting equipment shall be consistent with proper functioning of the WCF while mitigating the impact of the facility on the surrounding area. 
2.  WCFs with support structures shall consist of towers with a galvanized steel finish, or subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color (except in the M-1 and M-2 zoning districts), so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. At a tower site, the design of the building and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment. In most instances, WCFs with support structures should be of the monopole variety except when providers can document and demonstrate need for lattice-type towers. 
E.  Separation requirement. 
In zoning districts, other than general commercial and industrial districts, WCFs over ninety (90) feet in height shall not be located within one-quarter (¼) of a mile from any existing WCF that is over ninety (90) feet in height. 
F.  Lighting. 
Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by FAA or other applicable authority. Lighting may be required if the tower is near a non-FAA controlled landing strip pending review by the City Manager. If lighting is required, the City may review the available lighting alternative and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
G.  Noise. 
No equipment shall be operated at a WCF so as to produce noise in excess of the applicable noise standards under WAC 173-60, except for in emergency situations requiring the use of a backup generator, where the noise standards may be exceeded on a temporary basis. No generator shall be used prior to commercial power being delivered to the site. 
H.  Security fencing. 
WCFs with support structures shall be enclosed by a security fence not less than six (6) feet in height, and the support structure shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, that the City may waive such requirements, as it deems appropriate; however, nothing herein shall prevent security fencing which is necessary to meet other requirements of state or federal agencies. 
I.  Radio frequency emissions. 
1.  The Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (FTA) gives the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) sole jurisdiction in the field of regulation of Radio Frequency (RF) emissions, and WCFs which meet the FCC standards shall not be conditioned or denied on the basis of the RF impacts. 
2.  In order to provide information to its citizens, copies of ongoing FCC information concerning WCFs and radio frequency emission standards shall be made available. Applicants for WCFs shall be required to provide information on the projected power density of the facility and how this meets the FCC standards. 
J.  Federal requirements. 
All WCFs must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with authority over WCFs. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the WCFs governed by this ordinance shall bring such antenna arrays and/or support structures into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective dates of such standards and regulations unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring WCFs into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the WCF at the owner's expense in accordance with Section 5.05.07 of this UDO. 
K.  Structural integrity. 
To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the Electronic Industries Association/Telecommunications Industries (EIA/TIA) 222 Revision F Standard entitled "Structural Standards for Steel Antenna Towers and Antenna Supporting Structures (or Equivalent)," as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the City concludes a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the tower's owner, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said thirty (30) days, the City may remove such tower at the owner's expense in accordance with Section 5.05.07 of this UDO. A letter stamped by an engineer certified in the state shall be required stating that the WCF and support structure meets or exceeds all applicable requirements set forth herein.

In general, lot lines shall be laid out so as to not cross jurisdictional boundary lines. 
6.02.10 - Design Standards for Planned Developments 
A.  The project design standards and requirements of this Article may be modified in the case of a Planned Development (PD) which, in the judgment of the Carrollton Mayor and City Council, provides adequate public spaces and improvements for the circulation, recreation, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully developed and populated, provided zoning density standards for the entire tract are not exceeded, and which also provides such covenants or other legal procedures as will assure conformity to and achievement of the plan. 
B.  Plans for such developments shall be submitted to and approved by the Carrollton Mayor and City Council as a Planned Development (PD), as required by this UDO. No building permits shall be issued until such approval has been given. 
6.03.00 - REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS 

6.03.01 - Minor Subdivisions 
By definition, a minor subdivision does not involve the construction of major public improvements, such as new streets or stormwater detention. However, the following improvements are required in order to adequately serve the lots and protect the safe operation of the existing road: 
A.  Right-of way shall be dedicated along the property's frontage from the centerline of the existing road equal to ½ of the minimum requirement for the classification of the road, as established in Section 6.07.04. Minimum road improvements, (i.e. additional lane widening, curb and gutter, roadway overlay, etc.) may be required, if determined necessary by the City Engineer, to bring a substandard city road facility up to a minimum acceptable standard, within the limits of the property frontage being subdivided if the proposed subdivision is greater than five (5) lots. The requirement for such road improvements shall not alter or change the designation from Minor Subdivision. 
B.  The potential location of a driveway connection serving each lot and meeting the requirements of these development regulations shall be indicated on the final subdivision plat. 
C.  The stormwater carrying capacity of the road, whether in an existing ditch or gutter, shall not be compromised. If the stormwater characteristics of the existing road are inadequate to accommodate the new lots, the City Engineer may require improvement as appropriate. 
D.  Survey monument markers of all lot corners shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of Section 6.04.00. 
6.03.02 - Major Subdivisions, Multifamily and Non-[R]esidential Developments 
The following improvements shall be provided by the developer or at the developer's expense in every major subdivision or individual multi-family or non-residential development in accordance with the requirements and standards contained in this Article. 
A.  Survey monumentation in accordance with Section 6.04.00. 
B.  Streets providing access to such a development and to all lots in such a subdivision, including the extension of streets required to provide access to adjoining properties, in accordance with Section 6.07.00. 
1.  Streets contained wholly within such a subdivision shall be improved to the full standards contained in this Article. Existing streets that adjoin such a development shall be improved to the minimum standards from the centerline of the street along the development's frontage. 
2.  Curb and gutter where required along all roadways, or drainage swale where allowed. 
C.  Street name signs, stop bars, striping and traffic control signs, as approved by the City Engineer, shall be installed by the developer in accordance with Section 6.08.00. 
D.  Street lights in accordance with Section 6.09.00. 
E.  Driveway access to each lot shall be installed by the developer in accordance Section 6.10.00.

The total fee due shall be submitted with the application and review of the application shall not begin until the permit application fee is paid in full. 
7.12.00 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT MODIFICATIONS FOR OFF-SITE FACILITIES 
The stormwater management plan for each land development project should provide for stormwater management measures located on the site of the project. Where the physical characteristics of the site so dictate, as determined by the City Engineer, the applicant may be allowed to modify the stormwater management plan to utilize an off-site or regional stormwater management facility. A modified stormwater management plan must be submitted to the City Engineer that shows the adequacy of the off-site or regional facility. 

7.12.01 - Eligibility 
To be eligible for a modification, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that the use of an off-site or regional facility will not result in the following impacts to upstream or downstream areas: 
A.  Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life safety, and property. 
B.  Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures. 
C.  Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation. 
D.  Degradation of in-stream biological functions or habitat. 
E.  Water quality impairment in violation of state water quality standards, and/or violation of any state or federal regulations. 
The off-site or regional facility must be: 
A.  Located on property legally dedicated for the purpose. 
B.  Designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater quantity and quality control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices. 
C.  There must be a legally-obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the off-site or regional stormwater facility. 
In addition, on-site measures shall be implemented, where necessary, to protect upstream and downstream properties and drainage channels from the site to the offsite facility. 
7.13.00 - POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE CRITERIA 

7.13.01 - Water Quality 
All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
A.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
B.  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or non-structural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
C.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the City Engineer are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, non-structural practices, and pollution prevention practices. 
7.13.02 - Stream Channel Protection 
Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches. The City Engineer may modify or waive the requirements of this section for sites that discharge directly into larger streams, rivers, wetlands, or lakes, or to a manmade channel or conveyance system where the reduction in these flows will not have an impact on upstream or downstream streambank or channel integrity. 
A.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer. 
B.  24-hour extended detention storage of the 1-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event.

7.13.03 - Overbank Flooding Protection 
Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the 1-year, 24- hour storm under subsection 7.13.02 is waived or modified, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the 2-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. The City Engineer may modify or waive the provisions of this subsection for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
7.13.04 - Extreme Flooding Protection 
A.  Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and/or safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. 
B.  Extreme flood protection shall be provided either by controlling the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event through on-site or regional structural stormwater controls to maintain the existing 100-year floodplain and/or by sizing the on-site conveyance system to safely pass the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event and allowing it to discharge into a receiving water whose protected floodplain is sufficiently sized to account for extreme flow increases without causing damage. 
C.  The City Engineer may modify or waive the provisions of subsection (A) for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
7.13.05 - Structural Stormwater Controls 
A.  All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the City Engineer before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. 
B.  Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
7.13.06 - Stormwater Credits for Non-Structural Measures 
The use of one or more better site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under Section 7.13.01. The applicant may, if approved by the City Engineer, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
7.13.07 - Drainage System Guidelines 
A.  Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catch basins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutters, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters, shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more that one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements: 
1.  Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
2.  All culverts, pipe systems, and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
3.  Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
7.13.08 - Dam Design Guidelines 
Any land development activity that involves a site which proposes a dam, as such term is defined by O.C.G.A. § 12-5-372(4), shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety, as applicable. 
7.14.00 - CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION OF POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

7.14.01 - Inspections to Ensure Plan Compliance During Construction 
A.  Periodic inspections of the stormwater management system construction shall be conducted by the City Engineer or conducted and certified by a Professional Engineer (P.E.) licensed in the State of Georgia, a registered landscape architect (RLA), or a registered surveyor who has been approved by the City Engineer. However, the P.E. or RLA who conducts the periodic inspection, if applicable, shall not be the person who certifies the plans pursuant to Section 7.14.02. The purpose of the inspections shall be to establish compliance with the approved stormwater management plan. 
B.  All inspections shall be documented with written reports that contain the following information: 
1.  The date and location of the inspection. 
2.  Whether construction is in compliance with the approved stormwater management plan. 
3.  Variations from the approved construction specifications. 
4.  Any other variations or violations of the conditions of the approved stormwater management plan. 
C.  If any violations are found the applicant shall be notified in writing in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.15.00. 
7.14.02 - Final Inspection and As-Built Plans 
Upon completion of a project, and before a certificate of occupancy shall be granted or a final plat recorded, the applicant shall be responsible for certifying that the completed project is in accordance with the approved stormwater management plan. All applicants are required to submit actual "as-built" plans for any stormwater management facilities or practices after final construction is completed. The plan must show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and practices and must be certified by a P.E. licensed in the State of Georgia or an RLA. A final inspection by the City Engineer is required before the release of any performance securities can occur. The City Engineer may verify the accuracy of the submitted as-built plans prior to the issuance of a final recorded plat or certificate of occupancy. 
7.15.00 - VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES 

7.15.01 - Notice of Violation 
If the City Engineer determines that an applicant or other responsible person has failed to comply with the provisions of this article or is engaged in activity covered by this article without having first secured a stormwater management permit, a notice of violation shall be served on the owner or the responsible person in charge of the activity being conducted on the site.

ARTICLE 9 - VARIATIONS 
9.00.00 - GENERALLY 
The purpose of this article is to provide mechanisms for obtaining relief from certain provisions of this UDO. There are several ways that potential relief from hardship is addressed. Section 9.01.00 addresses relief through requirements regarding non-conforming development. Section 9.02.00 addresses relief through the grant of a variance in a particular situation due to the characteristics of the land to be developed based on the required site design standards. Section 9.03.00 addresses relief through the grant of an administrative waiver in specific situations. Section 9.04.00 addresses relief through recognition of vested rights regarding use and/or design. 
9.01.00 - NON-CONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES AND USES 

9.01.01 - Generally 
A.  Within the zoning and overlay districts established by this UDO there may exist lots, structures, or uses of land which were lawfully established before this UDO was adopted but which do not comply with the requirements set forth in this UDO. 
B.  It is the intent of Section 9.01.00 to allow these non-conformities to continue until they are removed or discontinued. It is further the intent of this section that non-conformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
C.  Non-conforming uses are declared to be incompatible with permitted uses in the district where the non-conforming use is located. 
D.  Nothing in Section 9.01.00 shall be construed to prevent the ordinary and routine maintenance and repair of non-conforming structures or structures which contain non-conforming uses provided that: 
1.  Repairs do not exceed ten (10) percent of the current fair market value of the non-conforming portion of the structure during any period of twelve (12) consecutive months; and 
2.  The cubic content of the structure is not increased. 
E.  A structure damaged or destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its fair market value at time of destruction shall be reconstructed only in conformity with the provisions of this UDO. 
F.  A structure that is damaged to an extent less than fifty (50) percent of the fair market value may be restored and occupied as before the damage, provided the following standards are met: 
1.  Restoration shall be commenced within six (6) calendar months from the date damages were incurred. 
2.  If reconstruction is not commenced within six (6) months, the reconstruction and use of the land or structure shall thereafter conform to the provisions of this UDO. 
G.  Fair market value, where required, shall be determined by reference to current statutory provisions pertaining to real estate assessment and the records of the Carroll County Tax Assessor. 
H.  A non-conforming structure or a structure containing a non-conforming use that is declared by the City Manager to be physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance shall not thereafter be restored, repaired, or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located. 
9.01.02 - Non-[C]onforming Lots of Record 
A.  Any lot of record for which a plat or legal description has been recorded in the Office of the Clerk of Superior Court of Carroll County at the time of adoption of this UDO and which fails to comply with the dimensional requirements for the district in which it is located may, if vacant, be used for any of the uses permitted within the zoning district by this UDO, provided that: 
1.  The minimum requirements of the zoning district for front, side, and rear yard, open space, height, and floor area shall be complied with. 
2.  The lot may be used for duplexes or multi-family dwellings when allowed within the zoning district only if the lot meets the minimum lot area requirements for those uses in the district. 
B.  Permitted Modification of Setback Requirements. 
When a building is proposed on a lot and when on either or both lots which adjoin such lot at the street right-of-way line there exists a principal building which does not conform to the setback requirements of this UDO, the required setback for such building shall be as follows: 
1.  Where only one (1) said adjoining lot contains a principal building with a non-conforming setback, the setback shall be the computed average of the normal setback requirement and the non-conforming setback, or 
2.  Where both adjoining lots contain a principal building each with a non-conforming setback, the minimum setback shall be the computed average of the two (2) non-conforming setbacks. 
C.  Adjoining Lots. 
When two (2) or more adjoining lots of record with continuous street frontage are in one (1) ownership at any time after the adoption or amendment of this UDO and such lots, individually, have an area, width, or street frontage that is less than required by this UDO, such groups of lots may be considered as a single lot for purposes of the minimum width, area, and street frontage required in the district in which they are located. 
D.  Individual lot not meeting minimum lot size requirements. 
Except as set forth in subsection 9.01.02 (A) of this section, in any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, any lot of record existing at the time of adoption or amendment of this UDO which has an area, width or depth less than that required by this ordinance may be used as a building site for a single-family dwelling. In the case of such a lot, when it is not possible to provide the required side yards and at the same time build a minimum width single-family dwelling, the Board of Development Appeals is hereby authorized to reduce the side yard requirements for such lot the minimum amount necessary for a reasonable dwelling, but in no case shall each of the side yards be reduced by less than five (5) feet in width. 
E.  Individual lot not meeting street frontage requirements. 
Any lot of record existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of this UDO, which has street frontage that is less than is required by this UDO, may be used if access to a publicly dedicated and maintained street can be demonstrated through a recorded easement. 
9.01.03 - Non-[C]onforming Structures 
A lawfully established structure that becomes non-conforming at the time of adoption of this UDO may continue subject to the following requirements: 
A.  The structure is non-conforming with only the following site design standards: 
1.  Minimum lot area; 
2.  Maximum lot coverage or impervious surface ratio; 
3.  Maximum building height; 
4.  Minimum front, side, and rear yard setbacks; and 
5.  Other requirements regarding building location on the lot. 
B.  The non-conforming structure shall not be enlarged. 
C.  The structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its degree of non-conformity. 
D.  If a non-conforming structure is moved for any reason for any distance, it shall be brought into conformance with the site design standards of the zoning district to which it is moved. 
E.  When any use of a non-conforming structure is discontinued for a continuous period in excess of six (6) months, any future use of the structure is permissible only when the structure has been brought into compliance with the provisions of this UDO. Holding of an occupational tax certificate does not in itself constitute continuance of a business. 
F.  Any existing use of a non-conforming structure may be changed to another use upon the finding by City Manager that the proposed use: 
1.  Is similar in its operation and effect on surrounding properties; 
2.  Will not generate more automobile or truck traffic, create more noise, vibration, smoke, dust or fumes, is not a more intensive use of structures than the existing use, and is not in any way a greater nuisance to the adjoining properties than the existing use; and 
3.  Will not have a negative impact on the public health, safety, and welfare.

APPENDIX A. - THE CITY OF CARROLLTON TREE SPECIES LIST 
The City of Carrollton Tree Species List 
The City of Carrollton Tree Species List is intended to support the development code, site planning and design activities for tree conservation and establishment, and tree maintenance planning and decision-making. Trees are arranged alphabetically by the tree's common name with the "genus" listed first. For example, red maple is listed as "Maple, Red" (maple is the genus name). The Latin name is also listed for more definitive species identification. In some cases, the commonly planted variety or cultivar of the species has also been included apart from the species. 
Key to Symbols and Tree Species Characteristic Descriptions
