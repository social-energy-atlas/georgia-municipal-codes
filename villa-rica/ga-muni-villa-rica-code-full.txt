PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Villa Rica, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1993 Code, as updated by ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and council through September 1, 2015. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1993 Code, as updated, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Jim C. Jenkins, Senior Code Attorney, and Beth Tattershall, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Alisa Doyal, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

(7)  The city stipulates that the furtherance of its strategic goals for job creation, stability and growth in the tax base, business retention, and other fiscal and economic development objectives may be considered during the procurement process. The city manager is authorized to establish procurement initiatives consistent with the city's strategic economic development objectives. These procurement practices shall be applied consistently and equitably, and shall have a direct relationship to the city's goals. 
(8)  City employees, officials, and their family members are generally prohibited from participation in any procurement decision or any gain of undue advantage in a procurement competition as a result of contemporaneous employment with a potential or actual business partner. 
(9)  It is unethical for any city employee to purchase commodities or services from a city contract for personal use. 
(10)  Individuals, firms and businesses seeking an award of a city contract may not initiate or continue any verbal or written communications regarding a solicitation with any city officer, elected official, employee or other city representative other than the purchasing agent named in the solicitation between the date of the issuance of the solicitation and the date of the final contract award by the city council. The city manager and budget officer will review violations. If it is determined that such communication has compromised the competitive process, the offer submitted by the individual, firm or business may be disqualified from consideration for award. 
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.060), 8-4-2015) 
Sec. 2-110. - Disclaimer of responsibility for improper purchasing. 
The city council may disclaim responsibility and liability for any purchase, expenditure, or agreement for expenditure arising from procurement made in its name, or in the name of any governmental body under its authority, by an unauthorized person or any person acting outside this article or the authorization or delegation as provided in this article. The expense of any such disclaimed transaction will become the personal liability of the individual who acted improperly. 
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.061), 8-4-2015) 
Sec. 2-111. - Evasion prohibited. 
No purchase or sale shall be artificially divided for the purpose of evading the provisions of this article. Neither shall this process be used for frequently recurring acquisitions that warrant volume purchases or periodic term contracts. 
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.070), 8-4-2015) 
Sec. 2-112. - Summary of methods of procurement. 
In most cases, this article recognizes seven methods of procurement and the conditions where each method shall be used: 
(1)  Informal purchase. Those purchases $10,000.00 or less do not justify the administrative time and expense for the conduct of competitive sealed bids or proposals. 
(2)  Competitive sealed bidding. In most cases the competitive sealed bid is the preferred method of procurement in the public sector and should be used whenever possible as it allows qualified, responsive bidders to compete on the basis of price. Generally, the following conditions must be met: 
a.  Clear and adequate specifications are available. 
b.  Three or more responsible bidders are willing to participate in the process. 
c.  Cost of materials, supplies, equipment, services or project is greater than $10,000.00. 
d.  Revenue is greater than $10,000.00. 
(3)  Competitive sealed proposal. When use of the competitive sealed bid is either not practical or not advantageous to the city, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposal. Use of the proposal is dependent upon such factors as: 
a.  Whether quality, availability or capability is overriding in relation to price in procurement of technical supplies or technical or professional services. 
b.  Whether the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with subsequent maintenance and service capabilities and what priorities should be given these requirements in the city's best interest. 
c.  Whether a fixed price or cost type contract is more advantageous. 
d.  Whether the market place will respond better to a solicitation permitting not only a range of alternate proposals, but evaluation and discussion of them before making the award. 
e.  Cost of equipment, services or project is greater than $10,000.00. 
f.  Revenue is greater than $10,000.00. 
(4)  Sole source purchase. A sole source procurement may be used when only one vendor or supplier is able to fill requirements for the intended use. Sole source may be used for compatibility with equipment for repair purposes, or for compatibility with existing systems. Standardization may require a sole source procurement, depending upon the intended use. Standardization, which is either established as a result of past procurements or by approval of the city manager, can be a satisfactory justification for a sole source. The city council shall approve all purchases where cost is greater than $10,000.00. 
(5)  Emergency purchase. The purchasing agent shall have the authority to purchase commodities and services where there exists an emergency constituting a threat to public health, safety or welfare or to the soundness and integrity of public property or to the delivery of essential services and where the adverse effects of such emergency may worsen materially with the passage of time. Acquisitions shall be made using such competitive procedures as circumstances reasonably permit. Emergencies shall be documented by the using department and submitted to the purchasing office. When a situation exists where time does not permit the involvement of the purchasing office, the user department director is authorized to purchase necessary commodities or make necessary repairs. For emergencies where cost exceeds the amount authorized to a using department, written documentation shall be prepared by the user department director and submitted to the purchasing office explaining the nature of the emergency. All emergencies where the cost is greater than $10,000.00 require ratification of the city council. 
(6)  Cooperative purchase. The city may participate in a cooperative purchase for commodities, supplies and services when determined that it is in the best interest of the city. The sponsoring entity, whether federal, state or local must have performed a competitive procurement process and entered into a contract that stipulates allowance for other governmental entities to purchase from the supplier at the same price and under the same terms and conditions as extended to it. If such arrangement has not been made a part of the contract, written permission from the sponsoring entity and the awarded supplier must be obtained. Documentation to substantiate this decision will be maintained by the purchasing office. Cooperative purchases where the cost is greater than $10,000.00 shall be approved by the city council. 
(7)  Governmental and affiliated entity purchase. The city may purchase services and incidental commodities from other federal, state or local governments, associations and nonprofit organizations when determined to be in the best interest of the city. Documentation to substantiate this decision will be maintained by the purchasing office. Such purchases where cost is greater than $10,000.00 shall be approved by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.080), 8-4-2015) 
Sec. 2-113. - Mandatory pre-qualification process. 
(a)  Public works construction contracts governed by O.C.G.A. § 36-91-20 et seq. The purchasing agent is hereby delegated the authority to administer a process for mandatory pre-qualification of prospective bidders for public works construction contracts pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-91-20(f). 
(b)  All other contracts. The purchasing agent is authorized to determine that a process for mandatory pre-qualification for competitive sealed bids and competitive sealed proposals of bidders or proposers is appropriate for the procurement of a particular commodity or service, subject to these requirements: 
(1)  Criteria for pre-qualification shall be reasonably related to the project or the quality of the work. 
(2)  Criteria for pre-qualification shall be available to any prospective bidder requesting such information. 
(3)  There shall be a method of notifying prospective bidders of the criteria for pre-qualification. 
(4)  There shall be a procedure for a disqualified bidder to respond to his disqualification to the purchasing agent; however, such procedure shall not include a formal appeal. 
(5)  No bid or proposal shall be eligible for consideration by the city from a prospective bidder who has not been pre-qualified on the procurement in question where the invitation to bid or request for proposals specified that pre-qualification would be mandatory, and any bid or proposal received shall be returned to the prospective bidder unopened. 
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.082), 8-4-2015) 
Sec. 2-114. - Purchases based on informal procurement. 
(a)  Generally. Procurements that involve amounts $10,000.00 or less do not require a formal sealed bid/proposal process. However, the processes used for this type of procurement will include as much competition as is consistent with the anticipated cost of the procurement and the best interest of the city. 
(b)  Prohibition of improper use of informal purchase process. Purchases may not be artificially divided as to constitute an informal purchase, thereby circumventing the dollar limit requirement for competitive sealed bids/proposals. 
(c)  Procedures. Procurement within this category shall be made in accordance with the informal purchase procedures established by the purchasing agent. These procedures will cover purchases delegated to user departments as well as those handled through the central procurement process. Such operational procedures shall provide for obtaining adequate and reasonable competition for the supply, service or construction being purchased. Further, such operational procedures shall require the preparation and maintenance of written records to adequately document the competition obtained, properly account for the funds expended and facilitate audit/review of the transaction. 
(d)  Types of informal purchases. Informal purchases are classified by two categories: 
(1)  Those that may be made directly by the using department. 
(2)  Those that are required to be made through the central procurement process. 
(e)  Informal purchase by user departments. 
(1)  Authority. Each user department is granted the authority, at the discretion of the department director or city manager, to handle purchases where the cost is less than $2,500.00. 
(2)  Prohibition of misuse. Purchases may not be artificially divided in order to qualify for handling by the using departments. Neither shall this process be used for frequently recurring acquisitions that warrant volume purchases or periodic term contracts. 
(f)  Informal purchases by purchasing staff. 
(1)  Purchasing staff shall obtain commodities and services competitively through telephone solicitations where the cost is $2,500.00 or less. A minimum of three quotations is required unless adequate source supply is not available. 
(2)  Purchasing staff shall obtain commodities and services competitively through written quotations where the cost is $2,500.00 to $10,000.00. A minimum of three written quotations is required unless adequate source supply is not available. 
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.090), 8-4-2015) 
Sec. 2-115. - Competitive sealed bids. 
(a)  Acquisitions greater than $10,000.00. Any commodity that is expected to cost or generate revenue greater than $10,000.00 shall be acquired through the competitive sealed bid process except as otherwise provided in this article. 
(b)  Dissemination of invitation to bid. Public notice of an invitation to bid shall be given as required by state law. The public notice shall contain a general description of the purchase, shall state the location where documents may be obtained and the date, time and place of bid opening. Notice of any required bonding and insurance shall be included in the public notice. A copy of such notice shall be posted in the purchasing office. Any other methods of advertisement identified as likely to result in additional competition may be used in addition to required advertisement, at the discretion of the purchasing agent. 
(c)  Receipt of bid. No written bid shall be eligible for consideration by the city unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the purchasing office by the date and time specified in the invitation to bid. All bids shall be stamped or annotated with the date and time of receipt and secured until the designated opening time. A bid delivered late shall under no circumstances be eligible for consideration by the city. 
(d)  Bid opening. Bids shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses on the date and at the time and place designated in the invitation to bid. The name of each bidder, the purchase price contained in each bid, and such other information as the purchasing agent deems appropriate shall be announced as the bids are opened. A record of bid information shall be recorded and available for public inspection. 
(e)  Modification of bid. Any clerical mistake that is patently obvious on the face of a bid, subject to the limitations described in this subsection, may be corrected upon written request and verification, submitted by the bidder. A non-material omission in a bid may be corrected if the purchasing agent determines the correction to be in the city's best interest. Omissions affecting or relating to any of the following shall be deemed material and shall not be corrected after bid opening: 
(1)  Price information. 
(2)  Any required bonding. 
(f)  Withdrawal of bid. Bids may be withdrawn at any time prior to the bid opening. After bids have been publicly opened, withdrawal of bid shall be based upon the following: 
(1)  The bidder shall give notice in writing of his claim of right to withdraw his bid due to an error within two business days after the conclusion of the bid opening procedure. 
(2)  Bids may be withdrawn from consideration if the price was substantially lower than the other bids due solely to a mistake therein, provided the bid was submitted in good faith, and the mistake was a clerical mistake as opposed to a judgment mistake, and was actually due to an unintentional arithmetic error or an unintentional omission of a quantity of work, labor or material made directly in the compilation of the bid, which unintentional arithmetic error or unintentional omission can be clearly shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of original work papers, documents and materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to be withdrawn. The bidder's original work papers shall be the sole acceptable evidence of error and mistake if a request is made to withdraw the bid. If a bid is withdrawn under the authority of this provision, the lowest remaining responsive bid shall be deemed to be the low bid. 
(g)  Bid evaluation. Bids shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation to bid. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that is not specifically set forth in the solicitation. 
(h)  Bid cancellation. An invitation to bid may be canceled prior to opening date or any or all bids may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, where it is in the best interest of the city in accordance with regulations promulgated by the purchasing office or, as a result of improper conduct on the part of a city employee. The reasons for any cancellation shall be made part of the bid file. 
(i)  Bid award. 
(1)  Responsive and responsible bidders. Subject to approval by the city council, bids shall be awarded to the responsible bidders who have submitted the lowest cost responsive bids, highest revenue responsive bids, or whose bid represents the best value to the city. 
(2)  Approval of bid. All bid awards for amounts greater than $10,000.00 (cost or revenue) shall be approved by the city council. 
(3)  Rejection or deferral of bid. The purchasing agent may reject bids, or may defer bid awards to allow time for additional evaluation or review of bids or for other business purposes, consistent with the best interest of the city. 
(4)  Disqualification of bid. The following types of bids shall be disqualified for consideration for a bid award: 
a.  A proposal submitted without required bonds. 
b.  A proposal submitted by an individual, firm or business on the ineligible source list. 
c.  A proposal which is incomplete in any material fact. 
d.  A proposal submitted by an individual, firm or business that has litigation pending against the city, or anyone representing a firm or business in litigation against the city, not arising out of the procurement process. 
(5)  Tie bids. In the event two responsive bids are tied for the lowest price and the other terms and conditions of the two bids are substantially the same, the bid shall be awarded to the local vendor if only one of the bidders has an office located within the boundaries of the city. If both or neither of the tied bidders are local vendors, the purchasing staff shall request the firm's best and final offers, and the award shall be to the lowest bid. 
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.100), 8-4-2015) 
Sec. 2-116. - Competitive sealed proposals. 
(a)  Acquisitions greater than $10,000.00. Any item or service which is expected to cost or generate revenue greater than $10,000.00, when the competitive sealed bid process is not applicable nor in the best interest of the city, shall be acquired through the competitive sealed proposal process except as otherwise provided in this article. 
(b)  Dissemination of proposal. Proposals shall be disseminated through a request for proposal. Public notice shall be advertised as required by state law. The public notice shall contain a general description of the item or service to be purchased, shall state the location where documents may be obtained and the date, time and place of proposal receipt. Notice of any required bonding and insurance shall be included in the public notice. A copy of such notice shall be posted in the purchasing office. Any other methods of advertisement identified as likely to result in additional competition may be used in addition to required advertisement, at the discretion of the purchasing agent. 
(c)  Receipt of proposal. No written proposal shall be eligible for consideration by the city unless it is placed in a sealed envelope or package and actually received by the purchasing office by the date and time specified in the request for proposals. All proposals shall be stamped or annotated with the date and time of receipt and secured until the designated opening time. A proposal delivered late shall under no circumstances be eligible for consideration by the city. 
(d)  Proposal opening. Proposals shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses on the date and at the time and place designated in the request for proposals. The name of each proposer shall be announced. 
(e)  Proposal cancellation. A request for proposals may be canceled prior to opening date or any or all proposals may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, where it is in the best interest of the city in accordance with regulations promulgated by the purchasing office or as a result of improper conduct on the part of a city employee. The reasons for any cancellation shall be made part of the proposal file. 
(f)  Proprietary information. Information submitted by a proposer that is specifically marked "proprietary" shall not be disclosed outside of the purchasing office without prior notification to the proposer. The city is required to comply with the Georgia Open Records Act (O.C.G.A. § 50-18-70 et seq.) and therefore may not be able to protect information submitted in any response. Entire proposals may not be deemed "proprietary." 
(g)  Evaluation of proposal. 
(1)  Initial evaluation. Each proposal shall be evaluated to determine whether it is responsive to the specifications and other terms and conditions contained in the request for proposals. With the approval of the purchasing associate named in the solicitation, the evaluating team may communicate with each proposer to clarify and amplify each proposer's proposal. No information concerning any other proposer's proposal shall be communicated in any way to the proposer. 
(2)  Request for supplemental information. Additional information may be requested of proposers. The purchasing office will initiate such requests. 
(h)  Award of proposal. 
(1)  Responsive and responsible proposal. Award shall be made to the responsive and responsible proposer whose proposal is determined to be the most advantageous to the city based upon the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposal. In the event there are two or more firms whose scores rounded to the nearest whole number result in a tie score, the award will be based on lowest cost. 
(2)  Approval of proposal. The city council shall approve all awards where cost or revenue is greater than $10,000.00. 
(3)  Rejection or deferral of proposal. The purchasing agent may reject, or may defer award for any proposal when he or she deems such action to be in the best interest of the city. 
(4)  Disqualification of proposal. The following types of proposals shall be disqualified for consideration for award: 
a.  A proposal submitted without required bonds. 
b.  A proposal submitted by an individual, firm or business on the ineligible source list.

(2)  Declaration of surplus property. Property is declared surplus by the city council in a regularly scheduled meeting. 
(3)  Notification to former or subsequent owner. The former or subsequent owner is notified in writing of intent to sell, as he has the first right to purchase the property at the fair market value price.

(4)  Selection of broker. The broker shall be selected competitively, by the competitive sealed proposal process, as outlined in section 2-115. 
(5)  Advertising and listing of property. Commencing at the time of the listing of the property as provided in O.C.G.A. § 32-7-4, the city shall publicly advertise once a week for two weeks in the legal organ of the city the property and the name of the broker handling the property. Property shall be listed for a period of at least three months. Property cannot be sold for less than fair market value excluding commission fee.

Sec. 2-123. - Disposition of personal property. 
(a)  Declaration of unserviceability. The city council shall determine whether a particular item or category of personal property can no longer be used advantageously by the city and has therefore become unserviceable. The city council may establish criteria establishing unserviceability for categories of personal property which may become unserviceable on a regular, frequently recurring basis, and may delegate to the city manager the determination of whether a particular commodity meets the criteria of unserviceability for its category. 
(b)  Disposition. Unserviceable personal property may be sold by public sale, sealed bidding, spot bidding or any other means deemed most advantageous to the city under the particular circumstances as determined by the city council. A sale to a private person shall be for the highest net purchase price reasonably obtainable by the city. A sale to another unit of government shall be for a fair and reasonable purchase price that need not be as high as the purchase price obtainable from a private person. All sales for personal property items where the original unit purchase cost is $10,000.00 or less shall be approved by the city manager. The city council shall approve sales for personal property where original unit cost exceeds $10,000.00. 
(Ord. No. 08-15-CCO, § 1(2.2.190), 8-4-2015) 
Sec. 2-124. - Leases of city owned real property. 
The city council may offer to lease city-owned real property if: 
(1)  The sale of the real property is not in the best interest of the city but the real property is not currently being used by the city. 
(2)  The real property has been newly acquired but not immediately put to use by the city, and may reasonably be leased on a month-to-month or short-term basis. 
A lessee's interest under any lease executed under this section shall constitute a usufruct only. Where city-owned real estate is to be leased for nonpublic use, the city manager shall cause public notice of the availability of the real property to be published, soliciting inquiries and offers. The city manager shall include as part of the solicitation the requirement that improvements to the real estate be insured for the city's benefit at the lessee's expense. The solicitation shall also describe any restrictions to be placed on the use of the real property. The city manager shall report to the city council all offers to lease the real estate and shall make recommendations as to which offer is in the city's best interest. The city council shall approve the offer that it deems to be in the best interest of the city. Such approval shall constitute authority for the city manager to execute a lease and any instruments on behalf of the city necessary to accept and effectuate the offer.

ARTICLE IX. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 8-257. - Adult entertainment establishments; findings; public purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. 
(b)  Based on the experiences of other counties and municipalities including, but not limited to, Troup County, Georgia; Saint Paul, Minnesota; Houston, Austin, and Amarillo, Texas; and Phoenix, Arizona; which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by the city, and based on the evidence and testimony of persons who have appeared before us, the mayor and council take note of the well-known and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among communities within our country. 
(c)  Moreover, it is the finding of the mayor and council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment", leads to an increase in the surrounding area of criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions, blight and diminution in property values. In the same manner, establishments offering photographic or videographic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community. 
(d)  Among the acts of criminal behavior identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and photographic adult entertainment are: disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use, and corruption of public officials. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and photographic adult entertainment are: depression of property values, acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described. 
(e)  Furthermore, it is the finding of the mayor and council that other forms of adult entertainment including, but not limited to, adult bookstores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in neighborhoods, commercial districts and urban life in general. 
(f)  Accordingly, it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety, and morals of the community to reduce the adverse impact of adult entertainment establishments by limiting the number of such uses, so as to reduce the negative impacts of adult entertainment establishments or adult uses upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semi-public uses, to ensure that adult uses and adult entertainment establishments do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts, and so as to avoid allowing adult entertainment and adult uses in heavily used public pedestrian areas. 
(g)  Therefore, the limitation of adult uses and adult entertainment establishments to certain prescribed areas of the city is in the public welfare, and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which provide or establish adult entertainment or adult uses. 
(h)  While it is recognized that such regulation as is established by this article cannot de facto approach prohibition as a protected form of expression would vanish, this article represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. 
(i)  To that end, the ordinance from which this article is derived is hereby adopted.

All persons who operate or ride in PTV on public roads do so with their own judgment and at their own risk, and must be observant of, and attentive to the safety of themselves and others, including their passengers, other motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the city has no liability in negligence, nuisance or under any other cause of action for losses resulting from the use of PTV on roads, sidewalks, rights-of-way or other public property under this article.

(c)  Whenever a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of the city charging that any dwelling, building, or structure is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property. If the officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may issue a complaint in rem against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the owner and parties in interest in such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the owner and the parties in interest; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the owner and parties in interest that a hearing will be held before a court of competent jurisdiction as determined by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5, at a date and time certain and at a place within the city where the property is located. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in court. The owner and parties in interest shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing. 
(d)  If after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
(1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
(2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
For purposes of this chapter, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be factors in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, ch. 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the city. 
(e)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure, to be repaired, altered, improved, to be vacated and closed, or demolished. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
(f)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the city are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
(g)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
(h)  With respect to the lien provided for in subsection (g) of this section: 
(1)  The lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in Carroll or Douglas County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(g). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of Carroll or Douglas County and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collection of real property ad valorem tax, including specifically O.C.G.A. title 48, ch. 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the city. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes; 
(2)  The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-7 et seq., unless such costs are waived by resolution of Carroll or Douglas County. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the city to pay the cost of administering the lien; and 
(3)  The city may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the city agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
(i)  Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
(j)  The public officers designated herein may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and may seek to enforce such citation in court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this chapter. 
(k)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to abrogate or impair the powers of the courts or of any department of the city to enforce any provisions of any local enabling Act, Charter, or ordinance or regulation nor to prevent or punish violations thereof; and the powers conferred by this chapter shall be in addition to and supplemental to the powers conferred by any other law or ordinance, legislation, or regulation.

Sec. 16-7. - Nuisances defined. 
A nuisance is anything which tends to lead to the immediate annoyance of the citizens in general, or which is manifestly injurious to the public health and safety, or tends greatly to corrupt the morals and manners of the people, with exception given to those rights protected in the Constitution. Nuisances include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Stagnant water on premises; 
(2)  Dead or decaying matter left unattended;

a.  The configuration of the lots and the history of development within the subdivision are such that no substantial harm is caused to other lots in the subdivision and that development of the vacant lots is not imminent; or 
b.  Additional green space will be created within a subdivision. The purpose of this waiver is to recognize that in some limited circumstances, it may be more appropriate to allow undeveloped lots to return to their natural state than to require unwanted and unnecessary maintenance. 
(4)  Excess smoke or fumes caused by burning; 
(5)  Maintaining a dangerous or diseased animal; 
(6)  Maintaining chicken coops or other animals which tend to cause excessive odor or sound; 
(7)  Obstruction of a public street, highway, sidewalk, or public right-of-way without a permit;

(10)  Non-functioning appliances, major auto repairs, non-licensed and/or inoperable vehicles, or similar unsightly objects which are visible from the public street or neighboring property. Each of these objects must be stored in an enclosed accessory building or in an area not visible from public streets or neighboring properties; 
(11)  Yard sales lasting longer than eight hours in any 24-hour period; 
(12)  Debris or other household items that can be seen from the public street or neighboring property; 
(13)  The pollution of public water or the injection of matter into the sewer system which would be damaging thereto; 
(14)  Any major auto repairs such as building motors, transmissions, or heavy body work visible from the public street or a neighboring property. Such work shall be done in an enclosed accessory building or on a section of property not visible from the public street or neighboring property; 
(15)  Abandoned mobile homes, manufactured homes, or recreational vehicles. No abandoned mobile, manufactured homes or recreational vehicle small be used as storage or accessory building; 
(16)  Any other condition constituting a nuisance under state law.

Sec. 16-46. - Special variances. 
(a)  The city manager, chief of police, or the chiefs designated representative shall have the authority, consistent with this article, to grant special variances. 
(b)  Any person seeking a special variance pursuant to this article shall file an application with the city manager, chief of police or the chief's designated representative.

(c)  In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the city manager, chief of police, or the chief's designated representative shall balance the hardship to the applicant, the community, and other persons of not granting the special variance against the adverse impact on the health, safety and welfare of persons affected, the adverse impact on property affected, and any other adverse impact of granting the special variance. Applicants for special variances may be required to submit any information the city manager, chief of police, or the chiefs representative may reasonably require. In granting or denying an application, the city manager, chief of police, or the chiefs representative shall place on public file a copy of the decision and the reasons for denying or granting the special variance. 
(d)  Special variances shall be granted by notice to the applicant containing all necessary conditions, including a time limit on the permitted activity. The special variance shall not become effective until all conditions are agreed to by the applicant. Noncompliance with any condition of the special variance shall terminate it and subject the person holding it to those provisions of this article regulating the source of sound or activity for which the special variance was granted. 
(e)  Application for extension of time limits specified in special variances or for modification of other substantial conditions shall be treated like applications for initial special variances. 
(f)  The city manager, chief of police, or the chiefs designated representative may issue guidelines approved by city council defining the procedures to be followed in applying for a special variance and the criteria to be considered in deciding whether or not to grant a special variance.

(b)  Whenever any city resident shall complain to the police department that a dog which habitually barks, howls or yelps, or a cat which habitually cries or howls, is being kept by any person in the city, a city law enforcement officer, prior to the issuance of a citation, shall notify the owner of such dog or cat that a complaint has been received. If the notice given to the owner alleged to be keeping a dog or a cat in violation of this article is ineffective, then the police shall issue a formal warning to the owner of such dog or cat that the owner shall take whatever steps necessary to alleviate the barking, howling, yelping or crying. If the warning given to the owner is ineffective, a citation shall be issued to the owner of the dog or cat. 
(c)  No provision of this section shall be construed to impair any common law or statutory cause of action, or legal remedy therefor, of any person for injury or damage arising from any violation of this section or from other law.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 12-08-CCO, § 1, adopted Sept. 4, 2012, set out provisions adding Ch. 13, Art. IV, §§ 13-57—13-66. For purposes of classification, and at the editor's discretion, said provisions have been included herein as superseding former Ch. 16, Art.

Sec. 16-111. - Short title. 
This article shall be known as the "Villa Rica Vacant and Foreclosed Property Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 12-08-CCO, § 1, 9-4-2012) 
Sec. 16-112. - Findings and intent. 
This article is adopted to address the interest of public safety. 
(a)  The governing authority finds that there is a need to establish a foreclosure and vacant real property as a mechanism to protect property values in neighborhoods for all property owners. 
(b)  Due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security of properties that are foreclosed or where ownership has been transferred after foreclosure, the property values and quality of life of neighboring properties are negatively impacted. 
(c)  Improperly maintained and secured foreclosed properties can become a hazard to the health and safety of persons who may come on or near the property and can adversely affect the aesthetic and economic attributes of communities. Difficulties also often arise in locating the person responsible for the condition of foreclosed real property. The governing authority finds that there is a substantial need directly related to the public health, safety and welfare to comprehensively address these concerns through the adoption of the provisions in this article. 
(d)  This foreclosure and vacant real property registry will require owners and agents to provide the city with official information for contacting a party responsible for bringing foreclosed and vacant real property into compliance with applicable provisions of Municipal Code of Villa Rica, Georgia.

Secs. 18-12—18-29. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - PROHIBITION ON THE USE, SALE, OR DELIVERY OF CERTAIN DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES AND ASSOCIATED PARAPHERNALIA 

Sec. 18-30. - Purpose. 
(a)  The mayor and city council has been informed about the presence of potentially dangerous substances affecting the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens, particularly the youth, of the city. In response to these warnings, the mayor and city council have been provided information indicating that this threat is presented in the form of products sold or distributed as a mixture of dried vegetation that, when covered, sprayed, or mixed with certain specific chemicals, produces the physiological and psychological effects of a controlled substance such as marijuana. 
(b)  Such substances are reported to cause hallucinations, vomiting, agitation, panic attacks, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, pallor, numbness and tingling, disorientation, loss of time awareness, and in some cases, tremors and seizures. 
(c)  These substances are generally described as synthetic cannabinoids of salvia divinorum distributed, sold, and marketed under such names as "K-3," "K-2," "K-2 Summit," "Genie," "Dascents," "Zohai," "Sage," "Spice," "Ko Knockout 2," "Spice Gold," "Spice Diamond," "Yucatan Fire," "Solar Flare," "Pep Spice," "Fire 'n' Ice," "Black Magic Smoke," "Salvia Divinorum," "Extreme Potpourri," and "Phat Cat." 
(d)  The substances described in subsection (c) of this section may be marked as incense, but are commonly being used as an alternative to marijuana, which is an identified and documented controlled substance, the sale and use of which is prohibited under the laws of the state and of the United States. These synthetic cannabinoid substances may be presented under a variety of street names, but share common ingredients including JWH018 and JWH073. Salvia divinorum contains the ingredient known as salvinorum A. These unregulated synthetic cannabinoids and salvia divinorum produce a very potent, intoxicating effect which is estimated by the medical community to produce effects ranging from three to 100 times greater and more potent than THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. 
(e)  The substances identified in this section manifest all of the demonstrated attributes that deprive persons of judgment, coordination, and the ability to conduct themselves in a safe and appropriate manner in modern society. The available medical and law enforcement information on these products indicate that a person under the effects of these substances may be a clear and present danger to themselves and others.

ARTICLE V. - TRAFFIC CALMING PROGRAM 

Sec. 22-121. - Purpose. 
In response to numerous complaints about speeding problems in neighborhoods, the City of Villa Rica Community Development Department has studied other similar communities along with other research on this topic. This research found that the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) completed a report for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) titled, Traffic Calming: State of the Practice. This report contains several types of traffic calming devices and defines traffic calming as follows: "Traffic calming is the combination of mainly physical measures that reduce the negative effects of motor vehicle use, alter driver behavior and improve conditions for non-motorized street users". The information in this report is critical to this policy and shall be used as a guide for any traffic calming device placed within Villa Rica. The above mentioned report is available for review at the community development office or you may order a copy from the ITE bookstore online at www.ite.org. The following policy has been established for the citizens of Villa Rica who wish to pursue the installation of traffic calming devices in their neighborhoods. 
The objective of the City of Villa Rica Traffic Calming Program is to provide property owners a process to have installed traffic calming devices on city-maintained neighborhood roads, where engineering studies indicate that their use would meet the desired results of reducing neighborhood speeds and their installation is favored by 75 percent of the homeowners in the subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 13-16-CCO, § 1, 7-5-2016) 
Sec. 22-122. - Installation considerations. 
The community development department will only consider installation of traffic calming devices on streets classified as local, residential streets with a posted speed limit of 25 mph or less. Data obtained from traffic engineering studies of physical and traffic-related factors should be used in determining where traffic calming devices are appropriate. Traffic engineering studies may indicate that traffic calming devices would be unnecessary or unsafe at certain locations. 
(Ord. No. 13-16-CCO, § 2, 7-5-2016) 
Sec. 22-123. - Legal authority. 
Only the Villa Rica City Council can authorize the placement of a traffic calming device and shall also have the authority to remove any traffic calming device as may be deemed appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 13-16-CCO, § 3, 7-5-2016) 
Sec. 22-124. - Standardization of application. 
In keeping with the general recommendation of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), uniformity aids in the recognition and understanding of traffic control devices. Therefore, strict adherence to the standards and guidelines outlined in this manual will help ensure that any given traffic calming device installation will be equally recognizable and require the same action on the part of the motorists regardless of where it is encountered. 
(Ord. No. 13-16-CCO, § 4, 7-5-2016) 
Sec. 22-125. - Traffic calming device design. 
The city will be responsible for having the new traffic calming device engineered by a registered professional engineer in the State of Georgia and submitted to community development for approval. The ITE report titled Traffic Calming: State of the Practice shall be utilized when considering an appropriate traffic calming device. The design for roadways and other structures shall be in accordance with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' A Policy on Geometric Design of Highway and Streets (commonly referred to as the AASHTO Green Book). 
(Ord. No. 13-16-CCO, § 5, 7-5-2016) 
Sec. 22-126. - Expense. 
The city will be responsible for the cost of engineering and construction of the traffic calming device. 
(Ord. No. 13-16-CCO, § 6, 7-5-2016) 
Sec. 22-127. - Procedure. 
(a)  Petition for traffic calming device. To have a traffic calming device installed in City of Villa Rica, a petition must be submitted to community development. All of the property owners in the subdivision or defined service area shall be contacted and given opportunity to sign this petition, indicating "yes" or "no" concerning the installation of traffic calming devices. If both husband and wife are joint legal owners, both signatures are required. A "Mr. and Mrs." signature is not acceptable. Owners must sign individually. This includes owners of undeveloped lots; renting tenants are not an acceptable substitute for the legal homeowner. No signature will be withdrawn from the petition after it is filed with community development. The purpose of the witness' signature is to verify the signatures of the property owners. The percentages will be calculated, based on individual lots where owners' sign affirmatively, divided by the total number of lots in the platted subdivision. Each lot counts as only one vote, regardless of the number of owners signing. If lots require more than one signature and do not have a unanimous vote, the vote will not be counted. At least 75 percent of the lots must vote in favor of the traffic calming device before petitions can be reviewed by community development. Once the petition is signed, notarized and returned to community development, it will be checked against tax records and land lot maps to insure it meets all requirements. For subdivisions not completely built out, a minimum of 60 percent of the total units within the subdivision must be occupied before a petition for the installation of traffic calming devices will be considered, and a minimum of 80 percent of the total units must be occupied before a petition for the removal of the devices will be considered. 
(b)  Speed criteria. Community development traffic studies must find a speeding problem does exist. The speed study will provide the 85th percentile speed, which must prove speeds are at least ten mph over the posted speed limit of 25 mph. The 85th percentile speed is an excellent indicator of street character and is used by nearly all states and cities for establishing regulatory speed limits. 
(c)  Removal process. Removal of traffic calming devices can proceed if the city is presented a petition requesting that the devices be removed. The petition must be completed following the same criteria defined in section 22-127(a). Such a petition for removal will only be considered after traffic calming devices have been in place for a period of at least one year. 
(d)  Design review process. All designs submitted to community development for traffic calming devices must meet all the requirements listed in sections 22-121, 22-124 and 22-125. Community development will review (allow up to 60 days) and possibly require modifications to the design. Once community development approves the design, it will be forwarded to the Villa Rica City Council for their consideration. 
(Ord. No. 13-16-CCO, § 7, 7-5-2016) 
Sec. 22-128. - General construction guidelines. 
(a)  Materials. All materials furnished and/or installed by the city shall be from sources certified by the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT), and shall meet all specifications set forth by GDOT. Hot mix recycled asphaltic concrete may be furnished and placed in lieu of virgin mix; in accordance with section 402 of the GDOT standard specifications. Any recycled material must be approved the community development department, and the finished work must meet the required density and gradation specifications set by GDOT standard specifications. 
(b)  Traffic control. The city shall furnish, install, maintain and remove all necessary traffic signs, barricades, lights, signals, cones and other traffic control devices; and all flagging and other means of traffic protection and guidance as required by the standard specifications of GDOT, and the MUTCD. 
(c)  Construction methods. All work performed for this project will be in accordance with GDOT Standard Specifications for Construction of Roads and Bridges, Current Edition, and the Supplemental Specifications, Current Edition, and attached modifications and special provisions. 
(d)  Signs and pavement markings. The city will supply and install all signs, posts, hardware and pavement markings for each traffic calming device.

403. - Design Criteria and Materials for Sewers. 
403.1  General: The criteria listed herein is not intended to cover all aspects of design, but rather to mention the basic guidelines and those particulars that are required by the City of Villa Rica Water and Sewer Department. For more detailed criteria, the reader should refer to standard references such as "Ten States Standards," Georgia EPD rules, Water Pollution Environment Federation Manual of Practice NO. FD-5, and other available literature. 
403.2  Types of Sewers: All sewers for the conveyance of wastewater shall be designed as separate sanitary sewers in which groundwater, stormwater or other runoff from roofs, streets, parking lots, foundation drains and any source other than wastewater are excluded. Overflows from sewers shall not be permitted. 
403.3  Design Period: Gravity sewer pipelines should, as a minimum, be designed with capacity sufficient to handle the estimated tributary population. Tributary population is considered to be all areas upstream of the discharge point of the system being designed as well as any anticipated pumped flow from other basins. Sewers will be designed and installed to the uppermost property line of the development being served. Consideration should be given to the maximum anticipated capacity of institutions, industrial parks, etc. 
403.4  Capacity and Size Determinations: In determining the required capacities of sanitary sewers, the following factors should be considered: 
1.  Maximum hourly sewage flow. 
2.  Additional maximum sewage or waste flow from industrial plants. 
3.  Ground water infiltration. 
4.  Topography of the area. 
5.  Depth of excavation. 
New sewer systems shall be designed on the basis of an average daily flow of sewage of not less than 400 gallons per household per day. Normally, all sewers shall be designed for a peak flow of not less than two and one-half times the average flow; this peak factor will be higher for smaller basins (see design guides). Sewers should be designed to carry the peak flow when flowing at a depth of two-thirds pipe diameter. The city land use plan should be consulted and special consideration given to commercial and industrial areas. Where developers are installing major trunk lines or interceptor sewers, the city's long-range plan should be consulted as a guide and the sewer should as a minimum be of the size called for in the long-range plan. If proposed land use conditions have changed subsequent to the plan, these changes should be factored into the determination. 
403.5  Special City Requirements: 
A.  Distance Between Manholes: Maximum distance between manholes shall be 400 feet. 
B.  Depth: Any sewers installed in the street shall, topography permitting, be sufficiently deep to provide five feet of cover over service laterals at the street right-of-way, and over any part of the main or service within the street right-of-way. The maximum depth for PVC pipe shall be 15 feet, depths in excess of this shall be ductile iron. Sewers installed in streets shall have maximum depth of 12 feet. Any sewers on off street easements shall have a minimum of four feet of cover unless ductile iron pipe is used. Filling over the pipe to obtain minimum cover is not allowed. 
C.  Drop Across Manholes: All manholes shall be provided with, a minimum vertical drop across the manhole (between in and out pipes) of 0.10 feet. 
D.  Detection tape shall be installed over all sewer pipe. Bury tape 18 to 24 inches below grade. Use detection wire on all service laterals. 
403.6  Slope: All sewers shall be so designed and constructed to give mean velocities, when flowing full, of not less than 2.0 feet per second based on Manning's formula using an "n" value of 0.013. The following are the minimum slopes which should be provided; however, slopes greater than these are desirable: 

 
These minimum slopes will be used only when sufficient flows are expected to maintain a velocity of 2.0 feet per second and maintain a cleaning action in the line. Sewers shall be laid with uniform slope between manholes. Sewers on 20 percent slope or greater shall be ductile iron pipe and shall be anchored securely with concrete anchors (See Standard Details) to prevent displacement by erosion or shock. Maximum slope of sewers shall be 30 percent and sewers shall be designed at less than 20 percent whenever possible. 
403.7  Increasing Size: When a small sewer is connected to a large one, the connection shall not be lower than matching the top of both sewers to the same elevation. 
403.8  Gravity Sewer Pipe Materials: The city reserves the right to disallow any Manufacturer that does not have a consistent, long-term record of quality control and successful product performance. Gravity sanitary sewer pipe up through 15-inch diameter will normally be Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), solid wall type SDR 35 thickness meeting ASTM D3034. Ductile Iron Pipe (DIP) will be used where certain conditions exist (see discussion of D.I.P.). For 18-inch diameter pipe and above, the Contractor may have the option of using either Polyvinyl Chloride (P.V.C.), Reinforced Concrete Pipe (R.C.P.), or Ductile Iron Pipe. The city may approve other types of pipe on a case by case basis and may limit the options of type of pipe depending on site conditions. This should be addressed at the preliminary review stage. 
Bedding for sewer pipe shall be as follows (also see city standard details): 
For PVC the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six inches below bottom of pipe extending up to six inches above top of pipe for the full width of the trench. 
For Concrete and Ductile Iron pipe the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six inches below bottom of pipe extending up to the top of pipe. In wet areas, the minimum bedding requirements will be increased as required to ensure a stable support under the pipe and on the sides of the pipe.

404. - Construction Methods. 
404.1  Licensing and Safety: All contractors who work on sewer systems that will be owned by the City of Villa Rica must be licensed in accordance with State of Georgia law and local ordinance. Compliance with applicable safety regulations is the responsibility of each company engaged in the work; the city assumes no responsibility for the actions of others on the job site. It is the responsibility of those installing sanitary sewers, lift stations and related appurtenances to conform to OSHA regulations, 29 CFR Part 1926, Subpart P, Paragraph 1926.650 through 1926.653. Publications from OSHA can be obtained by contacting OSHA Publications Distribution, Washington, D.C. 
404.2  Construction Permits: No construction shall be allowed until a construction permit has been issued by the City of Villa Rica. 
The contractor shall submit one copy of the approved construction plans which have been stamped approved. The contractor shall furnish his name and address, telephone number. He shall also furnish the name of the person in charge of the project and any subcontractors and the name and telephone number of a responsible person who can be contacted in case of emergencies during nonworking hours. 
The contractor shall furnish his construction schedule and shall notify the City 24 hours prior to doing any work. Once the contractor begins work, he shall proceed in a workmanlike manner and shall complete the work in a reasonable time without undue off days and periods of inactivity which make it hard for the City to keep up with his activity. 
404.3  Changes from Approved Plans: Any major changes from the approved plans will require that the engineer submit revised drawings along with a request explaining the reason for the change prior to construction of the change. Any deviation from City of Villa Rica standards will be considered a major change as will any change that will affect capacity, longevity, operation or maintenance of the facility. Any deviation from approved materials will not be accepted without prior approval. 
404.4  Trench Excavation: Sewer lines shall normally be installed by open-cut trench excavation. Trenches shall be cut true to the lines and grades shown on the plans. 
Pipe trenches shall not be excavated more than 100 feet in advance of pipe laying, and all work shall be performed to cause the least possible inconvenience to the public. Adequate temporary bridges or crossings shall be constructed and maintained where required to permit uninterrupted vehicular and pedestrian traffic. 
All excavations shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights in compliance with all OSHA and Georgia Department of Transportation requirements so as to protect the public and workers from hazard. 
Excavations adjacent to existing or proposed buildings and structures, or in paved streets or alleys shall be adequately protected by the use of trench boxes, sheeting, shoring and bracing to prevent cave-ins of the excavation, or the undermining or subsequent settlement of adjacent structures or pavements. Underpinning of adjacent structures shall be done when necessary to maintain structures in safe condition. 
Streets, sidewalks, landscapes, and other public and private property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored to as near as original condition as possible or better in a manner satisfactory to the City. 
Trenches shall be kept free of water by pumping or well-pointing, as determined by the contractor. No structure shall be built or pipe shall be laid in water. Water shall not be allowed to flow over or rise upon any concrete, masonry or pipe until the same has been inspected and the concrete or joint material has thoroughly set. All water pumped, bailed, or otherwise removed from the trench or other excavation shall be conveyed in a proper manner to a suitable place of discharge. Such discharge shall not cause injury to public health, property, work completed, work in progress, or to any street surface, or cause any interference with the use of same by the public. 
Construction occurring around active sewer systems shall be done in such a way so as to prevent the spillage of wastewater. 
404.5  Rock Excavation: Drilling and blasting operations shall be conducted with due regard for the safety of persons and property in the vicinity and in strict conformity with requirements of all ordinances, laws and regulations governing blasting and the use of explosives. Rock excavation near existing pipelines or other structures shall be conducted with the utmost care to avoid damage. Injury or damage to other structures and properties are the sole responsibility of the installation contractor and shall be promptly repaired by the Contractor to the satisfaction of the City and property owner. 
Rock in trenches shall be excavated over the horizontal limits of excavation and to depths as follows: 

 
The undercut space shall then be brought up to grade by backfilling with Size #57 crushed stone material or approved equal. 
404.6  Installation of Sewer Pipe: Construction stake-out will be required prior to construction of sewer lines. As a minimum, the horizontal alignment will be staked at 100-foot intervals and each manhole will be located with a centerline stake and two offset hubs. "Cuts" to invert elevations will be shown for each manhole entry and exit pipe. A copy of the stake-out notes will be provided to the city. 
Pipe and accessories shall at all times be handled with care to avoid damage. Whether moved by hand, skidways or hoists, material shall not be dropped or bumped. The interior of all pipe shall be kept free from dirt and foreign matter at all times. Each joint of pipe shall be unloaded opposite or near the place where it is to be laid in the trench. 
All such material that is defective in manufacture or has been damaged in transit or after delivery shall be removed from the job site. 
Sewer pipes shall be joined by "push-on" joints using elastomeric gaskets to affect the pressure seal. The ends of pipe to be joined and the gaskets shall be cleaned immediately before assembly, and the assembly shall be made as recommended by the pipe manufacturer. Lubricant used must be non-toxic and supplied or approved for use by the pipe manufacturer. Sewer pipes shall be laid in the uphill direction with the bells pointing upgrade. Any variation from this procedure shall require approval from the City. 
When pipe laying is not in progress, the open ends of installed pipe shall be plugged with a watertight plug to prevent entrance of trench water into the line. 
Bedding for pipe shall normally be as listed below (also see city standard details): 
For PVC the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six inches below bottom of pipe. For concrete and ductile iron pipe the minimum bedding shall be #57 or #89 crushed stone a minimum of six inches below bottom of pipe and initial backfill to the top of pipe for the full width of the trench. 
In wet areas, the minimum bedding requirements will be increased as required to ensure a stable support under the pipe and on the sides of the pipe. 
Backfill material up to 12 inches above the top of the pipe shall be compacted dry, loose, soil unless PVC is used in which case the first six inches above the top of pipe is required to be crushed stone. If such material is not available from the site then #57 stone shall be used to backfill up to 12 inches above the top of the pipe. Backfilling the remainder of the trench may utilize soil and blasted rock (not over 12 inches in any dimension) compacted sufficiently to avoid excessive settlement. Under no circumstances will tree parts, vegetation, building materials or any other type of debris be used for backfill. 
All backfill beneath roads, sidewalks or other critical areas shall be compacted to 95 percent Standard Proctor or as otherwise required by the D.O.T. or other such agency having jurisdiction using mechanical tamping equipment. Moisture control of the material may be required to achieve this compaction and hauling in of select material may be required. Compaction testing and certification by an independent soil testing company will be required in these areas at the Developers expense. 
404.7  Railroad Crossings: All railroad crossing shall conform to the requirements of the American Railway Engineering Association Manual for Railway Engineering, Part 5. The Contractor shall secure permission from the railroads to schedule the work so as not to interfere with the operation of the railroads. The Contractor shall be held responsible for any delays or damages occurring to the railroads. The Contractor will furnish the railroad with such additional insurance as may be required, cost of same to be borne by the Contractor, together with the costs for flagmen, watchmen, temporary work of any nature, safety devices and any other items that may be imposed by the railroad. 
404.8  Highway Crossings: All construction work in the State Highway right-of-way shall be approved by the Georgia Department of Transportation. Developer shall be responsible for obtaining encroachment permits. 
404.9  Stream Crossings: The preferred method of crossing a river, stream, creek, impoundments, or wet weather ditch is with a minimum of six inches of cover between the lowest point in the stream and the top of outside diameter of the pipe. Ductile iron pipe is required for all stream crossings and shall extend a minimum of ten feet beyond the top of bank on each side. Concrete collars or encasement must be provided at all joints for ductile iron pipe with less than three feet of cover. 
The stream bed and sides at the crossing site shall be protected from erosion with the use of Rip-Rap, as defined and sized in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control In Georgia, Appendix C Construction Materials, 1992 or most current edition. 
Aerial Crossings will require detailed plans and will be allowed only when, in the city's opinion there is no reasonable alternative. 
Erosion control measures shall be installed prior to installing pipe across any stream. All work should be performed when stream flows are at their lowest, and all work should be performed as quickly and safely as possible. As soon as conditions permit, the stream bed shall be cleared of all falsework, debris, and other obstructions placed therein or caused by the construction operations. 
Erosion control measures can include, but are not limited to, the following items: 
a.  Silt fencing, types A, B, and/or C. 
b.  Erosion control check dams. 
c.  Channel diversion through temporary storm drain pipe. 
d.  Rock filter dams. 
The construction and installation of these various structures are detailed in the Manual for Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Georgia or the Georgia Department of Transportation Standards and Construction Details, both of which are available for purchase by the Contractor. 
404.10  Casing for Sewers: Where pipe is required to be installed under railroads, highways, streets or other facilities by jacking or boring methods, construction shall be done in a manner that will not interfere with the operation of the facility, and shall not weaken the roadbed or structure. 
The diameter of the bore shall conform to the outside diameter and circumference of the casing pipe as closely as practicable. Any voids which develop during the installation operation shall be pressure grouted. Each segment of the casing pipe shall be welded (full circumference butt weld) to the adjoining segment. The completed casing shall have no sags or crowns which cause the grade for any segment to be less than the minimum slope for the size pipe being installed. 
The carrier pipe shall be fitted with approved spacers to secure its position within the casing. At each end of the casing pipe the void between the carrier pipe and casing shall be sealed with brick and mortar. 
404.11  Replacement of Pavement: Contractor shall fully restore and replace all pavement, curbs, gutters, sidewalks and other surface structures removed or disturbed, to a condition that is equal to or better than the original condition in a manner satisfactory to the City (see standard details). 
404.12  Location/Protection of Existing Underground Utilities: It is the responsibility of the Contractor to locate all underground utilities and to protect same. Utility lines or services damaged by the Contractor shall be repaired by the Contractor at the Contractor's own expense. The Contractor has sole responsibility of complying with all provisions of the Utilities Protection Code. 
404.13  Protection of Water Supply and Other Utilities: The City of Villa Rica has an established Cross-Connection Program to prevent the entry of contaminants or pollutants into any area of the potable water supply through the control of cross connections. It is illegal to introduce any substance into or to have any cross connections with the potable water supply. There shall be no physical connection between a public or private potable water supply system and a sanitary sewer which would permit the passage of any sewage or polluted water into the potable water supply. 
Whenever possible, sewers should be laid at least ten feet horizontally from any existing or proposed water main. Should conditions prevent a separation of ten feet, the lines shall be laid in separate trenches. 
404.14  Sewer Services: A sewer service shall be provided for every existing or proposed lot or building. All sewer services shall be a minimum of four inches in diameter unless otherwise specified. All service lines shall be designed to maintain a minimum of two feet/second sewer velocity. All services shall be shown on the construction and as-built drawings. A common service shall not be allowed for two or more buildings. The service shall extend to five feet inside the property line of the lot being served and normally be within ten feet of the lower corner of the lot. All service laterals shall be a minimum of five feet deep at the property line. Where five feet of cover cannot be achieved, sewer services shall be constructed of ductile iron. A 90 degree bend, constructed from two 45 degree fittings shall be installed at the end of all sewer services with a vertical section of pipe to extend a minimum of four feet above existing ground level (See Standard Details). Connections to the main exceeding eight feet in depth may have the saddle or tee rotated to a bend inserted in the service to provide five feet lateral depth at the property line. 
The developer shall be responsible for serving all lots developed. On any lot where the service cannot be found, the developer shall be responsible for payment of the cost of installation of the service. Also, unless noted on the final plat, the service shall be low enough to serve the first-floor elevation at the building line. Install 14-gauge detector wire on all laterals. 
The builder shall be responsible for the location of the service prior to the pouring of the foundation, driveway or other appurtenance. The City will not be responsible for any house built too low to be served nor for any service covered by construction. 
No plumber or contractor will be allowed to connect to the sewerage system except to the end of the service provided for his connection. Also, any service provided will be utilized without the installation of additional services. 
404.15  Clean-Up: Prior to requesting the "completion of sewer construction" inspection, the Contractor shall remove and dispose of in an acceptable manner all shipping timbers, shipping bands, spacers, excess materials, broken material, crates, boxes and any other material brought to the job site. 
Any work areas within public right-of-way or property outside of the development that were damaged by the sewer construction shall be repaired or replaced with the same kind of material as existed prior to the damage occurring. All easement areas shall be cleared of trees, stumps and other debris and left in a condition such that the easement can be maintained by bush-hog equipment. 
All shoulders, ditches, culverts, and other areas impacted by the sewer construction shall be at the proper grades and smooth in appearance. 
All manhole covers shall be brought to grade. 
A uniform stand of grass or mulch for erosion protection, as defined in the Manual For Erosion and Sediment Control In Georgia, is required over all construction easements and sanitary sewer easements prior to the City's acceptance of the sewer. Use a grass mixture consisting of at least 50 percent fescue. 
(Ord. No. 04-18-CCO , Att., 5-1-2018) 
405. - Inspection of Sewers. 
405.1  City Inspection: The developer's contractor will be responsible for the quality, accuracy and workmanship of his completed work. 
City personnel will visit the job site on a periodic basis and will make spot checks as they deem appropriate. The City of Villa Rica shall have the right to review and inspect all construction and may reject any work that does not meet quality control standards. 
405.2  Access to Project: Authorized representatives of the City of Villa Rica, which may include city employees, the city engineer, state or federal agencies, shall have access to the site for inspection at any time. 
405.3  Communications During Construction: A preconstruction conference will be required for all projects. The Developer has sole responsibility for scheduling. The Developer, design professional, contractor, and subcontractor(s) are required to meet with the City and all private utilities in this conference. The contractor will notify the city in writing two days before starting construction. The contractor will provide notification by phone any time the work is to be vacated and will provide notice by phone prior to resuming work. The contractor shall request the final inspection. 
The city inspector may have informal verbal communications with the contractor foreman or superintendent at any time during construction. The city inspector will not direct the actions of contractor's workmen. 
405.4  Concealed Work: The city inspector may direct that the contractor notify the city and receive inspection approval prior to concealing certain work such as manhole foundations, pipe bedding, tees, bends, service laterals, or other appurtenances. At the City's discretion, the City may require work to be uncovered which was not inspected prior to backfilling. 
405.5  Minimum Inspection by Developer: The following minimum information shall be determined and certified by the engineer: 
1.  Horizontal location. Horizontal location of the line will be checked by measuring "as-built" distances between manholes and bearings from manhole to manhole. 
2.  Elevation and slope. Elevation of each invert and top of manhole will be measured and recorded. Actual pipe slope will be computed and any segment having less than minimum allowable slope will be rejected and re-done. 
405.6  City Inspection: Cost for all testing shall be paid for by the developer. 
1.  Manhole construction. Manholes will be visually inspected to check for plugging of lift holes, use of connecting boots, use of joint material, leakage, proper invert construction, proper setting of frame and cover. 
2.  Pipe straightness. Sections of sewer line will be visually checked for straightness. A passing section shall show at least 80 percent of a full circle when observed from one end. Any section which fails this visual test shall be further checked. 
The section shall have water run through it sufficient to fill any sags that may exist. Then it shall have a television camera pulled through it to check for sags. Any sag holding more than one and one-half inches of water will require that the pipe be removed and replaced to proper grade after which the section shall be televised again to verify correction. The contractor may propose alternative methods other than televising sewers for the City's approval to determine failing sections of sewers. 
3.  Infiltration. The allowable limit for any section from manhole to manhole will be 100 gallons per day per inch of pipe diameter per mile of pipe. If any infiltration is present at the most downstream point, then it will be measured using a specially-made weir and measurements will also be made at each upstream manhole that has any visible flow of water. Any individual segment which exceeds the allowable infiltration shall be corrected to within allowable limits. 
4.  Compaction of backfill. Compaction testing may be required for sewers constructed in paved areas or where pavement is planned. A minimum of two tests per 500 feet of trench line located in roadways will be required. If any of these tests show failing results, then the failing backfill will be removed, re-compacted and re-tested, and one additional area will be tested as well. 
405.7  Other Testing Requirements: The tests listed below shall be performed by the contractor in the presence of the City. The city will be notified at least two days prior to these tests. 
A.  Mandrel Test for PVC Pipe: Procedure for testing PVC sewer pipe for maximum allowable deflection shall be generally as follows (Mandrel sized to 95 percent of the nominal internal pipe diameter): 
1.  Completely flush the line making sure the pipe is clean of any mud or trash that would hinder the passage of the mandrel. 
2.  During the final flushing of the line, attach a floating block or ball to the end of the mandrel pull rope and float the rope through the line. (A nylon ski rope is recommended). 
3.  After the rope is threaded through the line, connect the pull rope to the mandrel and place the mandrel in the entrance of the pipe. 
4.  Connect a second rope to the back of the mandrel. This will enable the mandrel to be retrieved if excessive deflection is encountered. 
5.  Draw the mandrel through the sewer line. 
6.  An increasing resistance to pull is an indication of excessive deflection. If this occurs mark the rope to note the location. Televise the sewer section to identify the extent of the problem and develop a plan, subject to city approval, for correcting the problem. The contractor may propose an alternative method other than televising sewers for the City's approval to determine locations of failing sewers. 
7.  Retest. 
B.  Air Pressure Test: A low pressure test of each sewer line section will be conducted by the contractor to check for leaks. The following general procedures will apply (also refer to ASTM specs): 
1.  Temporarily plug the line segment between two manholes using plugs having air tight fittings through which low pressure air can be introduced into the pipe segment being tested. 
2.  Introduce low pressure air into the test pipe segment until the internal air pressure reaches 4.5 psig above ground water pressure, if any. 
3.  Wait at least five minutes for air temperature in the test segment to stabilize while internal air pressure remains no less than 3.5 psig above ground water pressure. 
4.  Bleed internal air pressure to exactly 3.5 psig above ground water pressure. 
5.  Accurately determine the elapsed time for internal pressure to drop to 2.5 psig above ground water pressure. 
6.  The air test is acceptable if elapsed time is no less than shown by the following table: 

 
Air leakage time is based on pipe being damp. If pipe and joints are dry, dampen line if helpful in meeting air test time requirement. 
Permanently correct excessive leakage determined by air testing, and repeat operations until City witnesses a successful test on each line segment. 
Note: Upon request, the city may allow substitution of exfiltration test in lieu of air pressure test. If used, the exfiltration test will be conducted with a minimum water head of two feet above the groundwater table and the allowable exfiltration will be limited to 100 gallons per day per inch diameter of pipe per mile of pipe. 
C.  Manhole Testing: All manholes require testing by either the vacuum test or exfiltration test. 
1.  Exfiltration Test: Manholes which have been backfilled around shall be tested for exfiltration. The minimum test time duration is one hour. Manholes shall be filled with water to the top of ring. The maximum allowable exfiltration rate is two gal./ft. of depth/ft. of manhole diameter. 
2.  Vacuum Test: Vacuum testing of manholes for water tightness may be used in lieu of the exfiltration test prior to backfilling. After temporarily plugging pipe openings and installing the vacuum base on top of the cone, a vacuum of ten inches of Mercury shall be drawn and the vacuum pump shut off. With valves closed, the pressure shall be monitored for a time period of 60 seconds. At the end of the test period, if the vacuum is nine inches or greater, the manhole has passed the test. If the vacuum drops below nine inches, the manhole has failed. 
405.8  Final Inspection and Conditional Acceptance: In no circumstances shall any buildings and plumbing fixtures be connected to the sewers until inspected and approved by the City. 
The contractor shall request in writing a final inspection. This final inspection will generally include spot checks of manholes and sewer lines and a complete overview of the project. 
After any discrepancies are corrected, the city will issue a letter certifying conditional acceptance of the sewer system. This letter shall commence the start of the 18-month warranty period which is required of the contractor. 
On projects having phased development, this letter will allow the developer to apply for a permit for the next phase of development. 
At the end of 18 months, the subdivision inspection team will again re-inspect the entire development. When all discrepancies have been corrected, the city will issue an acceptance letter and will begin perpetual maintenance and operation of the sewerage system. 
405.9  Maintenance Bond or Letter of Credit: The developer shall post a maintenance bond or Letter of Credit of 25 percent of the total project cost on the facility for an 18-month period after completion and conditional acceptance of the facility by the City of Villa Rica for all projects whose costs exceeds $20,000.00. Bonds are to be written where the City of Villa Rica must release the bond in writing. Bond expiration dates for release are not acceptable. 
405.10  Maintenance until Final Acceptance: It shall be the developer's obligation to provide all maintenance for an 18-month period after conditional acceptance of the project by the City of Villa Rica. At the end of the 18-month maintenance period the City shall inspect the sewer system, and upon correction by the developer of all deficiencies noted by the City, the City will accept the sewer system for operation.

In cases where water lines cross sanitary sewers, there shall be a minimum of two feet vertical separation between the water and sewer mains. In cases where water mains parallel sewer mains there shall be a minimum of ten feet horizontal separation maintained between the mains. 
Trenches shall be dug so that the pipe can be laid to the alignment and depth required, and the trench shall be of such width and shall be braced and drained so that the workmen may work therein safely and efficiently. No chocking under the pipe will be permitted. All joints shall be as specified herein. Excavation must be made under the bell of each pipe so that the entire length of the pipe will lie uniformly on the bottom of the trench and the pipe weight shall not rest on the bells. Trenches shall be free of water during the work. 
Water lines shall have a minimum cover of 42 inches. All changes in grade shall be made gradually. At points of interference with storm sewers and cross drains, pipe will be run under the conflicting utility if the minimum cover cannot be maintained by going over the top of the pipe. 
In laying pipe across water courses, railroad crossings, or depressions of any kind, the minimum depth here specified shall be maintained at the bottom of the depression. 
Where necessary, the line shall be lowered at valves so that the top of the valve stem is approximately one foot below the finished grade. The trench shall be deepened to provide a gradual approach to all low points of the line. 
B.  Wherever rock is encountered in the excavation, it shall be removed by suitable means. If blasting is used for removal of rock, the contractor shall take all proper safety precautions. He shall comply with all rules and regulations for the protection of life and property that may be imposed by any public body having jurisdiction relative to the handling, storing and use of explosives. Before blasting, the Contractor shall cover the excavation with heavy timbers and mats in such a manner as to protect the adjacent property owners from damage. All rock encountered shall be removed six inches below the bottom grade of the trench and the trench built back to the correct grade with suitable material tamped into place. Sides of the trench shall be trimmed of projecting rock that will interfere with backfilling operations. The Contractor shall be wholly responsible for any damage resulting from blasting. Rock excavation by blasting shall be at least 75 feet in advance of pipe laying.

600. - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT/FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ORDINANCE 
Introduction 
It is hereby determined that: 
The flood hazard areas of the City of Villa Rica are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, stream bank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can (1) Protect human life and health; (2) Minimize damage to private property; (3) Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and (4) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section 36-1-20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Villa Rica does ordain this ordinance and establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property.

Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
Subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land resulting in one or more new lots or building sites for the purpose, whether immediately or in the future, of sale, other transfer of ownership or land development, and includes divisions of land resulting from or made in connection with the layout or development of a new street or roadway or a change in an existing street or roadway. 
Substantial Damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial Improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the City of Villa Rica, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
Substantially Improved Existing Manufactured Home Park or Subdivision is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certificates, or other evidence of compliance required in this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(Ord. No. 04-18-CCO , Att., 5-1-2018) 
604. - Standards for Development. 
604.1  Definition of Floodplain Boundaries. 
1.  Studied "A" zones, as identified in the FIS, shall be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available. 
2.  For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the future-conditions flood elevations shall be provided by the City of Villa Rica. If future-conditions elevation data is not available from the City of Villa Rica, then it shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the City of Villa Rica. 
604.2  Definition of Floodway Boundaries. 
1.  The width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA approved flood study. For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the regulatory floodway shall be provided by the City of Villa Rica. If floodway data is not available from the City of Villa Rica, then it shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the City of Villa Rica. 
604.3  General Standards. 
1.  No development shall be allowed within the future-conditions floodplain that could result in any of the following: 
a.  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
b.  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity; 
c.  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or, 
d.  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
2.  Any development within the future-conditions floodplain allowed under 1. above shall also meet the following conditions: 
a.  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
b.  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
c.  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
d.  Verification of no-rise conditions (0.01 foot or less), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of Section 604.4; 
e.  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from flood waters; and 
f.  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) or Conditional Letter of Map Amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the City of Villa Rica using the Community Consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of construction, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys for a final Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). 
604.4  Engineering Study Requirements for Floodplain Encroachments. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of Section 605.4 apply. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered Professional Engineer in the State of Georgia and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the City of Villa Rica prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
1.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
2.  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the City of Villa Rica. Cross-sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles; 
3.  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
4.  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments. 
604.5  Floodway Encroachments. Located within Areas of Special Flood Hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in 2. below. 
2.  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
3.  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the City of Villa Rica until an affirmative Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the City of Villa Rica. 
604.6  Maintenance Requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The City of Villa Rica may direct the property owner (at no cost to the City of Villa Rica) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the City of Villa Rica.

606. - Variance Procedures. 
The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this ordinance. A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the City of Villa Rica or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated herein above. 
1.  Requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance shall be submitted to the City of Villa Rica. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the City of Villa Rica. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
2.  Any person adversely affected by any decision of the City of Villa Rica shall have the right to appeal such decision to the Villa Rica City Manager. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
3.  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Villa Rica City Manager shall have the right to appeal such decision to the Villa Rica City Council. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
4.  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Villa Rica City Council may appeal such decision to a court of competent jurisdiction, as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. 
5.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of Historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a Historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
6.  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this Section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
7.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
8.  In reviewing such requests, the City of Villa Rica shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this ordinance. 
9.  Conditions for Variances: 
a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
(i)  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
(iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
b.  The provisions of this ordinance are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of a Historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
c.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
d.  The City of Villa Rica shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
10.  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the City of Villa Rica shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request.

(Ord. No. 04-18-CCO , Att., 5-1-2018) 
704. - Minimum Requirements for Erosion and Sedimentation Control Using Best Management Practices. 
A.  General Provisions: Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not excluded by this ordinance shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of Section 704 of this ordinance. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity. 
B.  BMPs: Best Management Practices 
1.  Best management practices as set forth in Section 704 of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the Director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
2.  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the City of Villa Rica or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the Director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
3.  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the City of Villa Rica or any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
4.  The Director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
C.  Minimum Requirements: The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
1.  Stripping of vegetation, re-grading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
2.  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
3.  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
4.  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
5.  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
6.  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
7.  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
8.  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
9.  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
10.  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
11.  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
12.  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
13.  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
14.  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in Section 704(B)(2.) of this article; 
15.  Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the Director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the Director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; provided, however, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the Director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
i.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
ii.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbance activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
16.  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the Board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The Director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
i.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
ii.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
17.  Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent the City of Villa Rica from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in Section 704(B)(2) and (3) of this article. 
18.  In non-trout streams like those in Villa Rica, the State requires a minimum 25-foot vegetated buffer extending from the stream bank or the point of wrested vegetation. However, in the City of Villa Rica these State standards have been extended to require a minimum 50-foot stream buffer with an additional 25-foot setback for any impervious surfaces. 
19.  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 04-18-CCO , Att., 5-1-2018)

800. - POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT 
Introduction. 
It is hereby determined that: 
Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both State and Federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution; 
Therefore, the City of Villa Rica has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
(Ord. No. 04-18-CCO , Att., 5-1-2018) 

801. - General Provisions. 
801.1  Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this ordinance is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This ordinance seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
1.  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
2.  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
3.  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
4.  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
5.  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
6.  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
7.  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up. 
801.2  Applicability. 
1.  This ordinance shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to Subsection 2 below. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
a.  New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more; 
b.  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more; 
c.  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the Ordinance Administrator to be a hotspot land use; or, 
d.  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in items (a.) and (b.) above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
2.  The following activities are exempt from this ordinance: 
a.  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project; 
b.  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
c.  Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; and 
d.  Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the Ordinance Administrator. 
801.3  Designation of Ordinance Administrator. The Villa Rica Community Development Director or the Public Works Department is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this ordinance. 
801.4  Compatibility with Other Regulations. This ordinance is not intended to modify or repeal any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law. The requirements of this ordinance are in addition to the requirements of any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, and where any provision of this ordinance imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provision is more restrictive or imposes higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall control. 
801.5  Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this ordinance shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this ordinance. 
801.6  Stormwater Design Manual. The City of Villa Rica will utilize the policy, criteria and information including technical specifications and standards in the latest edition of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and any relevant local addenda, for the proper implementation of the requirements of this ordinance. The manual may be updated and expanded periodically, based on improvements in science, engineering, monitoring and local maintenance experience.
