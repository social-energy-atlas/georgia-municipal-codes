PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Woodstock, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1989 Code, as supplemented through December 16, 2002, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1989 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Brad Christy, Code Attorney, and Sharon Allbritton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Rhonda L. Pezzello, City Clerk, Patricia Quigley, City Manager, and Eldon Basham, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 2-251. - In general. 
In lieu of a purchasing ordinance, the mayor and council has adopted a purchasing policy to be incorporated into the Woodstock Council Policy Manual known as CPM #200-0006. 
(Ord. of 5-24-2010) 
Sec. 2-252. - Purchasing card ordinance for elected officials. 
In addition to this Purchasing Card Ordinance, the mayor and council has adopted a purchasing policy located in the Woodstock Council Policy Manual known as CPM #200-0006 and a credit card policy known as CPM #200-0007. 
A.  Overview. The Georgia General Assembly established guidelines and penalties into the Official Code of Georgia Annotated ("O.C.G.A.") which provides that no municipal corporation shall issue government purchasing cards or government credit cards to elected officials on or after January 1, 2016, until the governing authority of the municipal corporation, by public vote, has authorized the issuance and has promulgated specific policies regarding the use of such government purchasing cards or government credit cards for elected officials of such municipal corporation. 
B.  Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to set requirements and standards for the City of Woodstock, Georgia Purchasing Card Program. The policy is not intended to replace current State of Georgia statutes but is intended to comply with such state laws and establish more efficient guidelines for elected officials using such purchasing cards. At no time should a city issued purchasing card or credit card be used for personal purchases regardless of the circumstances. Utilizing the purchasing card or credit card for personal use or for any item or service not directly related to such official's public duty may result in disciplinary action including, but not limited to, felony criminal prosecution. All purchases utilizing a government purchasing card or government credit card must be in accordance with these guidelines and with state law. 
C.  Scope. This purchasing card policy, as required by state law under O.C.G.A. § 36-80-24(c), applies to the use of government purchasing cards or government credit cards used by elected officials authorized to be issued such government purchasing cards or government credit cards. The below list of officials have been authorized by the governing authority of the city to use such government purchasing cards or government credit cards and must abide by all of the applicable state laws and this purchasing card policy. 
1.  Mayor 
2.  City council 
D.  Public inspection. In accordance with O.C.G.A. § 36-80-24(b) any documents related to purchases using government purchasing cards or government credit cards incurred by elected officials shall be available for public inspection. 
E.  Transaction limits. Transaction limits are hereby established to insure compliance with state purchasing laws, maintain proper budgetary controls, and to minimize excessive use of any individual credit line. Individual monthly card limits cannot exceed those established by the municipal governing authority. The established single transaction limit for each card must be less than $2,000.00. The established monthly card limit is based upon the city's budgetary constraints and is not to exceed $5,000.00 per month. Any exceptions to the standardized limits must have express written approval by the municipal governing authority and must be added to this policy by amendment or addendum. 
F.  Purchasing restrictions. 
1.  Elected Officials may not use a government purchasing card or government credit card for the following: 
a.  Any purchases of items for personal use. 
b.  Cash refunds or advances. 
c.  Any transaction amount greater than the transaction limits set for by this policy. 
d.  Items specifically restricted by this policy, unless a special exemption is granted by the municipal governing authority. 
e.  Alcohol or liquor of any kind. Such purchases should not be made with the purchasing card and may not be reimbursed by the city. 
f.  Purchases or transactions made with the intent to circumvent the city purchasing policy, transactional limits, or state law. 
2.  Elected Officials may use government purchasing cards or government credit cards to purchase goods and/or services not prohibited by this policy or state law. Such purchases include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Purchases of items for official city use which fall within the transactional restrictions of this policy. 
b.  Purchase of lodging, fuel, food, non-alcoholic beverages, or education and training materials while on city business. 
c.  Emergency purchases necessary to protect city property. 
G.  Administrator. The city designates the chief financial officer (CFO) or his designee, as the program administrator of government purchasing cards or government credit cards. Such administrator shall: 
1.  Serve as a liaison between the city's cardholders and the issuers of such cards. 
2.  Maintain the cardholder agreement for all cardholders. 
3.  Provide instruction, training, and assistance to cardholders.

7.  Ensure all card accounts are being utilized properly as set forth by state law and this policy. 
8.  Define the city's policy and procedures for proper documentation and storage of receipts, logs, and approvals required under this policy. 
9.  Identify any changes to named persons authorized to use a government purchasing card or government credit card. 
10.  Any other duties assigned by the municipal governing authority. 
H.  Accounting and auditing. The administrator, in an effort to ensure compliance with city policy and state law, will conduct monthly reviews and audits of all government purchasing card or government credit card transactions. The review is designed to ensure compliance, identify non-compliance issues and misuse, and through corrective measures assist the city with improving compliance. The monthly review and audit should happen within five days of the start of a new month. After completing the monthly audit the administrator shall notify cardholders of any violations or questions the administrator has that occurred within that previous month. Depending on the severity of the violation, the Administrator may suspend or revoke the use of the government purchasing card or government credit card after notification to the cardholder and to the municipal governing authority, but only after consultation with the city attorney. Any unresolved violations should be reported to the municipal governing authority and the city attorney in writing within five business days. 
I.  Violations. The use of a government purchasing card or government credit card may be suspended or revoked when the Administrator, after consultation with the city attorney, determines that the cardholder has violated the approved policies or state law regarding the use of the government purchasing card or government credit card. The government purchasing card or government credit card shall be revoked whenever a cardholder is removed from office with the city and shall be suspended if such elected official has been suspended from office. 
J.  Agreement. Before being issued a government purchasing card or government credit card under this policy and state law, all authorized users of government purchasing cards or government credit cards shall sign and accept below indicating that such user will use such cards only in accordance with the policies of the city and with the requirements of state law.

2.  The president of a corporation operating a professional bonding business in the city shall provide the city the names of all partners, officers, stockholders and any other person or corporation having an interest in or involved with the business of the corporation.

(4)  Individual bondsmen may not receive any compensation, gift or collateral for making or signing a defendant's bond.

This deposit will be returned to the person and/or surety upon proof by the surety that the defendant's case has been completed in court and that all legal obligations have been met by the surety. A surety may reclaim his deposit prior to the court appearance date for the defendant by surrendering the defendant to the jail designated by the municipal court and obtaining a receipt therefor from the chief jailer or his authorized deputy. The judge or clerk of the municipal court, or his authorized agent, may then return, or cause to be returned, the full amount of the cash bond provided the city does not have any accrued costs. 
(e)  Violations of law, agreements by bondsmen. Any violation of any law, agreement or condition set forth in these rules and regulations by a bondsman will result in a revocation of his right to sign bonds. Furthermore, any report furnished to the municipal court clerk of a violation of the law will result in an investigation by the chief of police's office. Information will be forwarded to the solicitor's or district attorney's office for further investigation and criminal prosecution whenever it appears there has been a violation of law. 
(f)  Approved bonds from other counties. 
(1)  The municipal court may accept an individual property bond from another county that has been approved by the sheriff of that county. This will be an exception to any general rule in view of the fact that the sheriff of the other county shall be responsible to the municipal court and the municipal court is not the originating guarantor on the bond.

(3)  The city will not accept approved bonds from another county signed by a professional bonding company which is not approved to do business in the city. 
Any professional bonding company desiring to sign bonds to be returnable to the Blue Ridge Judicial Circuit must comply with local regulations governing professional bondsmen.

It is also the purpose of this chapter to prevent and prohibit those conditions which reduce the value of private property, interfere with enjoyment of public and private property, create and constitute fire and other safety and health hazards, and generally create a menace to the health and welfare of the public and contribute to the degradation of the character of neighborhoods and depreciation of property values. It is necessary for the public health, safety and welfare to regulate, prevent and prohibit conditions which may constitute disorderly, disturbing, unsafe, unsanitary, fly-producing, rat-harboring and/or disease-causing places, conditions or objects. It is also necessary for the public social and economic welfare to regulate, prevent and prohibit conditions that degrade the city's scenic attractiveness and livability and its economic development.

ARTICLE II. - NUISANCES 

Sec. 38-31. - Conditions constituting a nuisance. 
For the purposes of this article, the existence or accumulation of any combination of the following conditions or things on lands within the city is hereby declared and defined to be a "nuisance and menace to public health, safety and welfare": 
(1)  Stagnant water on premises; 
(2)  Any dead or decaying matter, weeds, vegetation or any fruit, vegetable, animal or rodent, upon premises which is odorous or capable of causing disease or annoyance to the inhabitants of the city;

(Ord. No. 2797, Exh. A, 2-24-2014) 
Sec. 38-32. - Graffiti. 
(a)  Definitions. 
Graffiti shall mean any inscriptions, words, figures, paintings, or other defacements that are written, marked, etched, scratched, sprayed, drawn, painted, or engraved on or otherwise affixed to any public or private building, structures, places or property without prior authorization, in accordance with all ordinances of the city, by means of any aerosol paint container, broad-tipped marker, gum label, paint stick, graffiti stick, etching equipment, brush, chalk, dye, or other device capable of scarring or leaving a visible mark. 
Graffiti abatement shall mean the abatement procedure that identifies graffiti, issues notices to the landowner to abate the graffiti, and cures or removes such graffiti in absence of a response. 
Gum label shall mean any substance consisting of a material such as, but not limited to, paper, fabric, cloth, plastic, vinyl and/or any other similar material, where the material also contains one or more surfaces containing a substance such as, but not limited to, any material commonly known as an adhesive or glue, which cannot be removed from the surface in an intact condition and with minimal efforts, including, but not limited to, decals, stickers, patches, stamps, or labels. 
Private contractor shall mean any person with whom the City of Woodstock, Georgia shall have contracted to remove graffiti. 
(b)  Findings; nuisance. The city council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and is destructive of the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. Unless the city acts quickly to require the removal of graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti, entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the City of Woodstock, Georgia, and its residents. Further the city finds that rapid or prompt removal (less than 72 hours) serves as a deterrent to future defacement and such defacement is less likely to reappear. The city finds that graffiti and other defacement of public and private property, including walls, rocks, bridges, buildings, fences, gates, signage, other structures, trees, and other real and personal property within the city constitute a nuisance. 
(c)  Graffiti prohibited. It shall be a violation of this section for any person to write, draw, carve, scratch, erect, or place upon any wall, rock, bridge, building, fence, gate, signage, other structure, tree or real or personal property, either publicly or privately owned, any drawing inscription, figure, or mark of the type which is commonly known or referred to as "graffiti". Any such "graffiti" shall be removed or eradicated within 72 hours of its first appearance. 
(d)  Violation. A violation of any provision of this section shall be punishable by fine, restitution, or other penalty as the city council deems just and reasonable provided, however, no fine shall exceed the amount authorized by the City Charter. 
(e)  Notice to remove. 
(1)  Whenever the city's code enforcement officer or his designee determines that graffiti exists on any private property which is visible to any person utilizing any public road, parkway, alley, sidewalk, or other right-of-way or any public park or property, the code enforcement officer shall cause a notice to be issued to abate such nuisance.

ARTICLE III. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS 

Sec. 58-71. - Introduction. 
It is hereby determined that: 
Discharges to the City of Woodstock, Georgia's (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "city") municipal separate storm sewer system (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "MS4") that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
These nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the city's MS4 from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. 
These nonstormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume nonstormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. 
The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the city's MS4; 
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of State and Federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper nonstormwater discharges to the city's MS4; 
Therefore, the city adopts this article to prohibit such nonstormwater discharges to the city's MS4. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the city's MS4 is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.

(d)  Recurring, periodic performance evaluations are required for all probationary employees in full and part-time positions as well as for sworn police officers and fire fighters.

(i)  If an emergency arises during an employee's probationary period which requires a leave of absence, such time off, if granted, will not be considered as time worked.

(b)  If a holiday falls upon a Sunday, the following Monday shall be deemed to be the legal holiday. If the legal holiday falls on a Saturday, the preceding Friday shall be deemed to be the legal holiday. 
(c)  To receive pay for an official holiday, the employee must either: 
(1)  Work the days immediately before and after the holiday; or 
(2)  Be on approved paid leave on those days. 
(d)  Employees working flexible hours who are not scheduled to work on the day of a holiday will not have their holiday hours included in any calculations of overtime. Rather, they will be paid holiday hours in the amount proportionate to their daily flex time work hours. For example, if an employee is scheduled to work four ten hour days and the following day off coincides with a council designated holiday, then the flex time employee will receive ten hours of holiday pay. For the non-exempt flex time employee who is scheduled to work on a holiday, the individual will be paid for the hours worked in addition to the holiday hours granted in a proportional manner to the normal daily flex hours. Only the hours actually worked will be eligible for inclusion in the calculation of overtime. 
(e)  Firefighters and uniform sworn police officers (207(k) employees), and nonexempt employees that are not on flex schedules and authorized to work during any council designated holiday as defined in subsection (a) of this section, shall receive holiday pay for the council designated holiday at their normal hourly rates as well as pay for actual hours worked. Only the actual hours worked will be factored into the calculation of overtime pay. Holiday pay is not to be considered hours worked in the computation of overtime. 
Holiday pay for fire—12 hours 
Holiday pay for police patrol—12.25 hours 
Holiday pay for police admin—8.5 hours 
Holiday pay for general employees—8 hours 
(f)  Any employee who has accrued holiday hours [shall use such holiday hours earned prior to using vacation hours.]

A probationary employee called will have his probationary period extended to by the same amount of time as required for serving on jury duty. An employee who receives notice of jury duty or witness service must notify his supervisor immediately in order that arrangements may be made to cover the position. The city reserves the right to request that an employee who is called for jury be excused if their absence would create a hardship on the operational effectiveness of the department to which they are assigned. 
(b)  Time away will not affect personal leave accruals. 
(c)  Employees who appear in court as the plaintive or defendant in any action not related to their official duties shall not be paid for time away from work unless that time is accrued personal leave. 
(d)  The employee may keep any court payment for services performed on the days of his regularly scheduled workday or performed while on personal leave.

(c)  In the case of unforeseen sickness or injury of the employee or an immediate family member, the employee must advised their supervisor or department director as soon as possible that they are going to be absent but not later than the employee's scheduled reporting time unless prohibited from doing so for reasons determined by the supervisor or department director to be beyond the employee's control. The employee should also let the supervisor know when they anticipate returning to work. This procedure shall be followed every day the employee is unable to work, unless the absence has been scheduled in advance. A physician's certification may be required as validation of an unforeseen sickness or injury to the employee or their family member. 
(d)  Upon termination from city employment, employees shall be entitled to compensation at their current hourly rate for up to 50 percent of their accrued personal leave provided they give at least two weeks' working notice or are not terminated for cause as defined in section 70-242.

Personal leave donations will not be made to an employee to provide a paid vacation. Employees terminating their employment with the city for any reason may not donate personal leave to other employees. Employees may receive a maximum of two work weeks personal leave donations for any specific incident. Donations greater than two weeks must be approved by the city manager. 
(n)  Holidays. Paid holidays occurring during personal leave are not charged to personal leave.

An employee may cash out personal leave with approval of the department director and the city manager and subject to departmental funds availability in the annual budget. Employees will only be allowed to cash out 40 hours in a 12-month period.

Sec. 70-244. - Grievance/appeals process. 
(a)  The grievance procedure is established to provide opportunity to non-probationary employees to bring to the attention of management, situations that directly affect the employee's working conditions. It is the intent and desire of the city to adjust complaints or grievances informally, and both supervisors and employees are expected to make reasonable efforts to resolve problems as they arise. However, it is recognized that there will be grievances, which will be resolved only after an appeal and review. The submission of a grievance by an employee shall in no way adversely affect the employee or their employment with the city.

Employees who are currently assigned to probationary periods based on promotion, demotion, or transfer who have completed the initial probationary period are considered eligible to file appeals or grievances under this section. 
(c)  In order to assure non-probationary employees', a method by which the employee can get a particular grievance considered rapidly, fairly and without reprisal, the following steps are provided: 
Step 1 — Supervisor 
The aggrieved employee shall, within three working days of the incident, explain and discuss the complaint or grievance orally with the supervisor involved. Higher level supervision may be called into the discussion in an effort to achieve a prompt adjustment. 
The supervisor will make a decision and notify the employee in writing within a reasonable time after discussion with the employee. Normally a reasonable time as used herein would be considered to be three working days. Circumstances may warrant a longer time frame. Ultimately, the city manager will determine whether the response was within a reasonable time. 
The supervisor must provide the department director with a copy of the written decision. 
Step 2 — Department Director 
If the aggrieved employee feels that the matter has not been settled or adjusted to his/her satisfaction by the supervisor, they may submit the matter in writing to the department director within three working days from receipt of the answer in Step 1. 
The department director or his/her designee, shall meet with the employee within a reasonable time. The department director or his/her designee will provide a written answer to the employee within a reasonable time. 
The department director must provide the human resources director copies of all relating documents and the written decision in Step 2. 
The department director at Step 2, is the final appeal level for all grievance and appeals other than adverse actions as defined in section 70-243(2), grievances involving sexual harassment; or grievances regarding actions under section 70-3, Discrimination which are herein referred to as "Appealable Grievances." 
Step 3 — City Manager 
If the aggrieved employee feels that an appealable grievance has not been settled or adjusted to their satisfaction by the department director, they may submit the matter in writing for review by the city manager. Requests to submit grievances or appeals to the city manager must be submitted to the human resources director within five working days from receipt of the answer in Step 2. 
The city manager or his/her designee shall meet with the employee within a reasonable time after receipt of the grievance. The city manager or their designee will provide a written answer to the employee and the human resources director within a reasonable time. 
Step 4 — City Council 
If the aggrieved employee feels that the matter has not been settled or adjusted to their satisfaction by the city manager, they may submit the matter in writing for review by the city council. Requests to submit grievances or appeals to the city council must be submitted to the city clerk within five working days from receipt of the answer in Step 3. 
The city council has the option to hear or decline to hear any appeal 
(d)  Any grievance shall be considered settled on the basis of management's response at the completion of any step, unless it is appealed within the time limits set forth.

The city shall cooperate with a grantee in negotiating and obtaining permission to use such facilities. 
(c)  No poles, cables, equipment or wires for the construction, maintenance and operation of the CATV system shall be installed or the installation thereof commenced on any existing pole within the city until the proposed location, specifications and manner of installation of such cables, equipment and wires shall have been set forth upon a plat or map showing the existing poles, streets, alleys or highways within the city where such installations are proposed and submitted in writing by a grantee to the city manager and approved by that department in writing.

The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of the wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same and a grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance.

(1)  Build a control structure in the discharge line from his premises, immediately prior to the entrance of the discharge line into the city sewerage system, suitable for the sampling and measuring of wastes. Plans for this structure must be approved by the city. This requirement may be waived if deemed unnecessary by the city. If no special manhole is required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. 
(2)  Contact the city prior to operation changes which will materially alter the characteristics of the waste from the last prior sampling. 
(3)  Make timely, periodic payments to the city of surcharges for excessive loadings as detailed in the city user charge system.

ARTICLE IV. - STORMWATER UTILITY 

Sec. 98-150. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this article is to regulate fees and charges for stormwater utility services, define the scope of responsibility, establishes an enterprise fund, credit and appeal policies, billing and collection policies, and other policies and procedures related to establishing the stormwater utility. 
(Ord. of 5-9-2006) 
Sec. 98-151. - Findings. 
The city council makes the following findings: 
(1)  The Federal Clean Water Act as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) and rules promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Act emphasize the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting and funding stormwater management programs which address water quality impacts of storm water runoff. 
(2)  Stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities will assist the city in meeting the regulatory obligations imposed by its national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permits by reducing pollution and increasing water quality within the city. 
(3)  Stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities will assist the city in protecting the public health, safety and welfare and the environment. Providing stormwater management services, systems, and facilities renders both service and benefit to individual parcels, parcel owners, citizens and residents of the city. 
(4)  The area of impervious surface on each parcel is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each parcel is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a stormwater service charge. 
(5)  A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city and surrounding areas. 
(6)  Stormwater runoff is associated with all developed properties, whether residential or non-residential, and the impacts of runoff from individual properties are directly related to the amount of impervious surface on a property. 
(7)  The professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the city properly assesses the stormwater management needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the city. 
(8)  The professional engineering and financial analyses identified a need to meet these goals and establish a funding mechanism in the city dedicated specifically for generating consistent, stable and adequate revenue to fund stormwater management services. 
(9)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed through the city limits of Woodstock. While specific service and facility demands vary from location to location, a service area that encompasses all lands and water bodies within the geographic limits of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
(10)  The city is responsible for the protection and preservation of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community, and the environment and finds that it is in the best interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city and the community at large and the environment to proceed with the development, implementation, and operation of a utility for stormwater management accounted for in the city budget as a separate enterprise fund dedicated solely to stormwater management and to institute funding methods associated therewith. 
(11)  Considering these findings, the city council finds that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities, and the city council finds that a stormwater service fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding stormwater management services in the city. 
(Ord. of 5-9-2006(2)) 
Sec. 98-152. - Definitions. 
The following definitions shall apply to this article. Any word or phrase not defined below but otherwise defined in the Code of Ordinances shall be given that meaning. All other words or phrases shall be given their common ordinary meaning unless the context clearly requires otherwise. 
Creation of impervious surface shall mean activity on land, with or without a certificate of occupancy, creating a slab, roof or paved area in excess of 200 square feet. Creation of impervious surface shall not mean graded parcels with no structures, graded soil, graded parcels containing only a compacted building pad, as examples. 
Credit shall mean a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system or facility or the provision of a service or activity by property owner, which system, facility, service, or activity reduces the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. The basis of such credits, if granted, will be defined by a specific written agreement at the determination of the stormwater utility manager in accordance with the stormwater utility credit policy. 
Customer shall mean all persons or entities to whom the stormwater service charge is billed. 
Detached dwelling unit shall mean developed land containing one structure which is not attached to another dwelling and which contains one or more bedrooms, with a bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one family. Detached dwelling units may include houses, manufactured homes, and mobile homes located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Developed land may be classified as a detached dwelling unit despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, or small storage buildings, or the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional impervious areas such as parking spaces, playgrounds, or structures or additions to the building which are used as offices, storage facilities, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship, or similar non-residential uses. Detached dwelling unit shall not include developed land containing: structures used primarily for non-residential purposes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located within manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by other than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes, or multiple dwelling unit residential properties. 
Developed land means real property which has been altered from its "natural" state by addition of any improvements, such as grading, paving, compaction, construction of structures or impervious surfaces greater than 200 square feet, or drainage works so that hydrologic response of the property is changed from that which would occur in the natural undeveloped conditions. For new construction, property shall be considered developed pursuant to this article upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or upon creation of impervious surface or final inspection if no such certificate is issued. 
Equivalent residential unit (ERU) means the statistical average impervious surface area of a detached single-family residential property within the city. An ERU will be determined through engineering and analysis and will be documented in the Stormwater Utility Implementation Guidebook. This unit may be used in the rate study evaluation to determine and compute the service charge for all developed land served by the Woodstock Stormwater Utility. An alternative unit of measure for impervious surface may be used for the rate structure. The methodology and basis for the stormwater service charge will be defined in the Stormwater Utility Implementation Guidebook. 
Hydrologic response of a property is the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious area; the size, shape, topographic, vegetative, and geologic conditions of a property; antecedent moisture conditions; and groundwater conditions on a property. 
Impervious surfaces shall mean those areas, which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development. The following types of surfaces will be considered "impervious surfaces" for purposes of the stormwater utility: the projected area of buildings; asphalt-, concrete-, brick-, or stone-paved areas; improved vehicular drives and parking areas; gravel surfaces; fabric or plastic coverings; and other surfaces that prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff or that change the hydrologic response of the property that existed prior to development. 
Parcel shall mean a designated parcel, tract, or area of land established by plat, subdivision, or as otherwise permitted by law, to be separately owned, used, developed, or built upon. 
Private stormwater management system shall mean those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainageways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm drains, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff or water quality which are not public. 
Public stormwater management system shall mean those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm drains, public streets, curbs and gutters, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey or otherwise influence either the movement of stormwater runoff or water quality, which are either owned by the city or over which the city has accepted an offer of dedication of an easement or other legally binding permanent right of use for stormwater drainage, and for which the city has the obligation of maintenance for stormwater drainage purposes. 
Service charges shall mean the stormwater management service charges applicable to a parcel of developed land, which charge shall be reflective of the service provided by the city. The charge shall be used to fund the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and systems. Stormwater service charges shall be based on the relative contribution of each parcel to the demand for stormwater management services, shall be structured so as to be fair and reasonable and shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities. The cost of operating expenses, capital investments and reserve accounts may be included in the stormwater service charges. Service charges are based on measurable parameters that influence the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities, with the most important factor being the amount of impervious area on each parcel of land. The use of impervious area as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one or more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management of that property, including but not limited to charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and enhanced level of stormwater services above those normally provided by the city. 
Single-family residential shall mean a developed lot containing one dwelling structure with its principal use being a residential dwelling. 
Stormwater management system means any one or more of the various devices used in the collection, treatment, or conveyance of storm, flood or surface drainage waters, including all manmade structures or natural watercourse for the conveyance or transportation of runoff, such as: detention areas, lakes, berms, swales, improved watercourses, open channels, streams, culverts, pipes, catch basins inlets; collection, or drainage. 
Stormwater utility guidebook shall mean the document that defines the basis for the stormwater utility, policies and procedures for operating the utility, and other necessary information determined to help document how the utility was developed and how it is operated. 
Stormwater utility manager means the city manager or his/her appointee that has direct responsibility for the management of the city stormwater utility. The stormwater utility manager will report to the public works director. 
Undeveloped land is land in its unaltered natural state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or gravel surfaces or structures in excess of 200 square feet which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state.

• Public education and outreach on stormwater issues; 
• Public involvement and participation; 
• Illicit discharge detection and elimination; 
• Post-construction stormwater management; 
• Pollution prevention; 
• Floodplain management; 
(f)  A comprehensive listing and description of services the stormwater utility will provide will be detailed in the Stormwater Utility Implementation Guidebook. This guidebook will be completed prior to the first billing of the stormwater utility fees. 
(Ord. of 5-9-2006(2)) 
Sec. 98-155. - User fee charges. 
It shall be the policy of the city that funding for the stormwater utility be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs and/or the level of service provided as a result of the provision of stormwater programs, services and facilities. Service charges for stormwater management shall be fair and reasonable and shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing programs, services and facilities and acquiring property. The cost of stormwater programs, services and facilities may include operating, capital investment, and reserve expenses, and may consider stormwater quality as well as stormwater quantity management requirements. Similarly situated properties shall be charged similar rentals, rates, charges, fees, tolls, or licenses. 
Service charge rates shall be designed to be consistent and coordinated with the use of other funding methods employed for stormwater management by the city, whether within or outside the stormwater utility, including but not limited to plan review and inspection fees, special fees for services, fees in-lieu of regulatory requirements, impact fees, system development charges, and special assessments. 
The rate structure will be developed by October 2006 and will be documented in the Stormwater Utility Implementation Guidebook. In order to fully recover the cost of providing stormwater management services and systems while fairly and reasonably apportioning the cost among developed properties throughout the city, the city will conduct an evaluation of rates. 
The service charge will be based on the amount of impervious surfaces on a particular property that is developed, while undeveloped properties will not be assessed a stormwater utility fee. Stormwater utility rates will be reviewed on an annual basis and any rate changes will be approved by the city council. While the rate structure has not yet been determined but will be documented in the Stormwater Utility Guidebook, the option for non-residential properties to be billed on a quarterly basis will be offered. 
(Ord. of 5-9-2006(2)) 
Sec. 98-156. - Stormwater user fee charge exemptions. 
Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no public or private property located in Woodstock shall be exempt from the stormwater user fee charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in the stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities. 
Exemptions to the stormwater user fee charges are as follows: 
(1)  Parcels upon which the creation of impervious surfaces has not occurred; 
(2)  Railroad rights-of-way (tracks). However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, or other developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater service charges; 
(3)  All public road rights-of-way; and 
(4)  Cemeteries.

Sec. 98-158. - Credits. 
(a)  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater service charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to Woodstock's standards by private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities or to private stormwater management systems which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems. 
(b)  Property owners of developed land may receive a stormwater service charge credit. The specific credits will be determined based on the guidelines in the Stormwater Utility Implementation Guidebook. Credits for structural controls will be based on best management practices performance as defined by the design criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, First Edition, August 2001. 
(c)  Credits may be partial or full credits and property owners can receive a maximum 40 percent credit. 
(d)  Property owners seeking stormwater service charge credits must apply for stormwater service charge credits through completion and submittal to the Woodstock of a stormwater service charge credit application. 
(e)  Upon receipt of a completed application, Woodstock shall review the application and make a determination as to whether the applicable criteria for a credit have been met. All decisions regarding the approval or disapproval of a stormwater credit shall be made within 45 days of the date the completed application was received by Woodstock. 
(f)  Any credit allowed against the service charge is conditioned on (1) continuing compliance with Woodstock's design and performance standards as may be updated or amended from time to time; and (2) upon continuing provision of the systems or facilities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. The city may revoke any credit at any time for non-compliance with this article. 
(g)  Stormwater utility fees may be adjusted retroactively to the date that Woodstock received the completed application. 
(h)  Applicants receiving credit for a structural control as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual must have an approved maintenance plan on file with the city and the applicant's property must have on-site stormwater management and treatment facilities. 
(i)  A customer shall reapply every three years for the credit granted, however, Woodstock may terminate the credit if Woodstock finds the facility does not comply with the original approved credit application. 
(Ord. of 5-9-2006(2)) 
Sec. 98-159. - Stormwater service fee, billing, delinquencies and collections. 
(a)  The stormwater service fee may be billed separately, or on a customer statement and collected along with other fees for services, at the city's sole discretion. Unpaid stormwater service fees may subject the customer to lawsuit. 
(b)  A stormwater service fee bill may be sent through the United States mail or by alternative means notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due, and the date when past due. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for non-payment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fee. If a customer is underbilled or if no bill is sent for developed land, Woodstock may backbill for a period of up to one year, but shall not assess penalties for any delinquency due to the failure to send a bill or an under billing. 
(c)  Unpaid stormwater service fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by Georgia law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment. Unless reduced to a judgment and a writ of fiery facias issued, the unpaid user fee charge shall not constitute a direct lien against the property. However, the owner shall be personally responsible for the fees. 
(d)  A late charge of ten percent of the amount due per year shall be assessed against the customer for the unpaid balance of any stormwater service fee that becomes delinquent. In addition, the city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, against the property owner. 
(Ord. of 5-9-2006(2); Ord. of 9-9-2013) 
Sec. 98-160. - Stormwater utility inspections and enforcement. 
(a)  Every owner of developed real property located in the city, and every person who serves as a contractor or developer for the purpose of developing real property located in the city shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, treat, control and discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all city ordinances and development regulations, and the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States of America. 
(b)  When the stormwater utility manager determines that a public nuisance exists, the stormwater utility manager shall send a notice of maintenance requirements by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner or owners of the property described, as their name and address are shown on the latest ad valorem tax records of the county property appraiser. This notice shall be deemed complete and sufficient when so addressed and deposited in the United States mail with proper postage prepaid. The notice of maintenance requirements shall inform the property owner that a violation of this article exists on the identified property with the description of the public nuisance, that the property owner is responsible for maintaining the identified private storm water system, that the property owner may allow the city access to the property to abate the nuisance at the expense of the property owner, and that formal enforcement action will be taken if the violation is not corrected within the time period indicated on the notice. The stormwater utility manager shall determine a reasonable period of time for correction of the nuisance. In determining a reasonable period of time, the stormwater utility manager shall consider the following: practicality and ease of correction; the owner's ability to correct the violation; the severity of the violation; the nature, extent, and probability of danger to the public, and other relevant factors. 
Notice, as required under this provision, shall not be required: (a) when the stormwater utility manager determines that the public nuisance presents an imminent endangerment to persons or property; (b) when a notice of maintenance requirements has been sent to the same property owner or owners for the same violation within the previous three months; or (c) when notice by certified mail cannot be effected on the owners of record. 
The notice of maintenance requirements shall contain substantially the following information and may be in the following form or other appropriate form: notice of maintenance requirements: name of owner; address of owner; description of property; inspection date; determination made by the stormwater utility manager that the condition on the property is creating adverse conditions so as to constitute a violation of the this article; describe the conditions that caused the property to be in violation and any recommended actions that may be necessary to remedy the nuisance; specify a reasonable time period to proceed and remedy the nuisance; or provide written permission to the city to enter the site and abate the nuisance at owner's expense. 
Within the reasonable period of time for compliance specified in the notice of maintenance requirements, the property owner shall either abate the nuisance or file a written request with the city for a hearing before the stormwater utility manager to show that the condition alleged in the notice does not exist or that such condition does not constitute a public nuisance in violation of the ordinance. 
(c)  Any failure to meet the obligation set forth in this section shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by any damaged party or the city in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance with the actual cost thereof assessed against the owner or developer, if any, on a joint and several basis. From the date of the filing of such action, the city shall have lien rights, which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of city court. The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance with this section.
