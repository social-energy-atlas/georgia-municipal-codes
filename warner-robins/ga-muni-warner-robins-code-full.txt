PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Warner Robins, Georgia of a general and permanent nature. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1977 Code, as supplemented through January 17, 1989, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the mayor and council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1977 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the second section of Chapter 1 is 1-2. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 1-1 and 1-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 1-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 2 and 3, it will be designated as Chapter 2.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Indices 
The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, and Robert Coutre′, Code Editor of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

The publisher is most grateful to Mr. James E. Elliott, Jr., City Attorney, Mr. Clayton P. Mays, City Clerk and Ms. Carolyn Robbins for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

Sec. 5-204. - Refunding revenue bonds. 
(a)  The City of Warner Robins acting through its governing body may exercise all powers granted to municipalities under the Revenue Bond Law (Ga.

Pending the retirement of the revenue bonds being refunded the city shall deposit a sufficient portion of the proceeds of such revenue refunding bonds, together with any other legally available funds, in escrow to pay principal, interest and redemption premiums on the revenue bonds to be refunded, and some or all money so deposited may be invested in direct obligations of the United States of America or any of its agencies or in obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States of America. In determining the sufficiency of such deposit, the city may include interest to be received on such investments. 
(b)  The city shall, upon depositing in escrow the proceeds of any revenue refunding bonds hereunder, enter into an agreement with the bank holding such deposit and said agreement shall require said bank, among other things, to hold the investments and liquidate the same without further instructions from the city when necessary to pay principal, interest and redemption premiums on the revenue bonds refunded and may require such bank to publish on behalf of the city, one (1) or more notices of redemption of the revenue bonds to be refunded.

(d)  Such revenue refunding bonds shall constitute investment securities under the Uniform Commercial Code but no financing statement nor continuation statement need to be filed to protect or perfect the interest of the holders of said revenue refunding bonds in the revenues pledged to their payment. Such revenue refunding bonds may be secured by pledge of all or any portion of the revenues to be derived from the operation of one or more revenue-producing facilities of the city after payment of the reasonable and necessary expenses of operation and maintenance, and such revenues need not be limited to revenues pledged to the revenue bonds refunded. Revenue refunding bonds shall not be payable from or charged upon any funds other than the revenues pledged to the payment thereof, nor shall the city be subject to any pecuniary liability thereon.

Each bond issued under this section shall contain a recital setting forth the substance of the preceding two (2) sentences.

All bonds issued under this section bearing the signature of officers in office on the date of the signing thereof shall be valid and binding notwithstanding that before the delivery thereof, and payment therefor, such officers whose signatures appear thereon shall have ceased to be officers of the municipality issuing the same. Pending the preparation of the definitive bonds, interim receipts, in such form and with such provisions as the governing body may determine may be issued to the purchaser or purchasers of bonds to be issued under this section. Said bonds shall be and are hereby declared to be nontaxable for any and all purposes.

The purpose of this statement of financial policy of the city is to serve as a foundation for long and short term range planning, facilitate decision making, and provide direction to the Governing Body and operational staff for handling the city's day-to-day financial business. Because of the board and diverse nature of the city's departments, committees and blended component units, having written defined financial policies minimizes the risk of developing conflicting or inconsistent goals and objectives which could have a negative impact on the overall financial condition of the city.

All appropriated funds, except for the mandatory appropriations required by law and those required to meet contractual obligations or the continued appropriation and authorization of state or federal grants, remaining unexpended and not contractually obligated at the expiration of the municipal appropriations ordinance, shall lapse. 
All state or federal funds received by the city are hereby continually appropriated in the exact amounts and for the purposes authorized and directed by the state or federal government in making the grant. 
The adoption of an annual budget for the next fiscal year shall not in itself constitute specific approval for the expenditures identified therein which shall be subject to the requirements of section 5-401 of this charter.

The mayor shall submit to the council at least sixty (60) days prior to the start of the fiscal year a draft of the recommended municipal appropriations ordinance in a form and manner as may be prescribed by ordinance, which shall provide for the appropriation of the funds necessary to operate all the various departments, and to meet the current expenses of the city for the next fiscal year. 
(b)  Budget ordinance. Each municipal appropriations ordinance, now of force or hereafter adopted with all amendments as are adopted from time to time, shall continue in force and effect for the next fiscal year after adoption and it shall then expire except for any mandatory appropriations required to meet contractual obligations or the continued appropriation and authorization of state or federal grants.

(d)  Operating budget polices. 
(1)  The city will finance all current expenditures with current revenues and will avoid budgetary procedures that balance current expenditures through the obligation of future resources. The city will avoid using short term financing to meet operating budget requirements. 
(2)  All governmental funds (general, special revenue and capital project) budgets must be balanced. Budgets for proprietary funds (enterprises and internal service) will be prepared to establish fees and charges and to maintain managerial control. 
(3)  The city budget shall be adopted at the legal level of control, which is the fund/department level (i.e, expenditures may not exceed the total for any department within a fund).

(6)  The lowest level of fund balance classification for the city's capital project funds will be assigned fund balance for the funding of specific projects. An assigned fund balance will be spent first, unless the expenditure(s) are tied to a restricted fund balance amount. Once a project is completed, any fund balance remaining will be transferred back to the fund(s) which were the original funding source. 
(7)  By their nature, any debt service funds will only classify fund balances as nonspendable or restricted. When debt expenses are paid, the city will use restricted fund balance first.

In the event that governmental accounting standards change which eliminates the inclusion of the "Budgetary Comparison Schedule—General Fund," a statement of similar nature should be used in its place. 
(9)  General fund unassigned fund balances which exceed the minimum level established by this policy may be appropriated by the governing body for non-recurring capital projects, equipment or other operating uses. 
(10)  Should the general fund's unassigned fund balance fall below the minimum targeted level as defined in this policy, the governing authority must approve and adopt a plan to restore the general fund's unassigned fund balance to its target level within a twenty-four (24) month period. If due to severe financial hardship of the city, the general fund's unassigned fund balance cannot be restore within this period, the governing authority shall establish a different time period. 
(11)  The city's governing authority shall avoid the appropriation of general fund's unassigned fund balance for recurring operating or capital expenditures unless there is some extraordinary, non-recurring event which would require the appropriation in order to meet the needs of the citizenry or an emergency. 
(12)  The city shall classify its enterprise funds' net assets as Restricted, Unrestricted or Invested in Capital Assets.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 18-97, adopted March 3, 1997, did not specifically amend the Code; hence, inclusion herein as Ch. 2.5 was at the discretion of the editor. See the Code Comparative Table. 
Cross reference— Adult entertainment in alcoholic beverage establishments, § 4-38. 

Sec. 2.5-1. - Introduction. 
Based on the City of Warner Robins' own experiences with an establishment offering public nudity in conjunction with the sale of alcoholic beverages and the experiences of other counties and municipalities, including, but not limited to, Peach County, Georgia, Austin, Texas and Garden Grove, California, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by Warner Robins, Georgia; and based on the documentary evidence and oral testimony presented by citizens, and an expert in economic development at the public hearing on January 6, 1997; and based on documentary evidence submitted to the Warner Robins City Council, the city council takes note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country. 
It is the finding of the Warner Robins City Council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, other adult businesses have the same deleterious effects on the community. 
Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and other adult businesses are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and other adult businesses are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described. The city council finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in Warner Robins as well. 
The Warner Robins City Council therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and playgrounds to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult business establishments. Therefore, the city council finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult business establishment. The city council finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further finds that such will not infringe upon the protected constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this chapter is hereby adopted. 
(Ord. No. 18-97, § 1.005, 3-3-97)

Editor's note— Ord. No. 20-15, §§ 1—11, adopted July 20, 2015, repealed article II and enacted a new article II as set out herein. The former article II, §§ 3-26—3-29 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 14-89, adopted February 6, 1989. 

Sec. 3-26. - Purpose and intent. 
Given the undue burden placed on law enforcement providers by excessive false alarms, this article is enacted to establish reasonable expectations for alarm users regarding the responsible use and operation of alarm systems. The article is not intended to create new or to expand existing legal obligations of the city, including specifically the Warner Robins Police Department, or to establish a special duty or special relationship between the city and alarm users, persons who own real or personal property where an alarm system is in place, and/or persons who are physically present at or in the vicinity of property monitored by an alarm system. 
(Ord. No. 20-15, § 1, 7-20-15)

Effective August 1, 2015, no alarm system shall be used unless the alarm user first registers for such alarm system within seven (7) days of its installation with the city. For the purposes of complying with this section, an alarm contractor may register an alarm user and thereby obtain the permit for such alarm system; provided, however, that the alarm user shall ultimately remain responsible for alarm registration prior to use of the alarm system. Upon registration, each alarm permit shall be assigned a permit number. If the permit number is issued directly to the alarm user, the user shall provide the permit number to the alarm contractor to facilitate law enforcement dispatch. 
(b)  Nontransferability; new registration required. Alarm registration is not transferable. Upon transfer of the possession of premises at which an alarm system is maintained, the new alarm user shall register his or her alarm system within seven (7) days of the acquisition of the property or installation of a new alarm system.

(1)  Attempt to verify, by calling the alarm site and/or alarm user by telephone, to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting dispatch. Telephone verification shall require, at a minimum, that, if the first attempt fails to reach an alarm user, the alarm contractor must make a second call to a different number in an effort to reach an alarm user who can provide proper identification and assist in determining whether an alarm signal is valid. 
a.  The failure of an alarm contractor, or any person or entity providing similar monitoring services, to attempt to verify the alarm signal will not negate the end user's responsibility for violations of Code section 3-31(2) and any penalty or fine associated therewith. 
b.  Such second call for verification shall not be required in the event of a panic or robbery-in-progress alarm or in cases where a crime-in-progress has been verified by video and/or audible means. 
(2)  Communicate any specific information that will assist law enforcement response and investigation to the emergency communications center at the time of a request for assistance.

(c)  Payment of civil fines. All civil fines shall be paid within thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice. 
(d)  Limitations on responses for excessive false alarms or nonpayment. When an alarm user has ten (10) or more false alarms during the permit year or when the alarm user is sixty (60) or more days delinquent on payment of any civil fine, a law enforcement response to the alarm user's permitted location will only be initiated in response to a 911 call to the emergency communications center or upon verification by the alarm contractor or user that the alarm was set off as a result of criminal activity. Normal alarm responses by WRPD will be restored under the following circumstances: 
(1)  When a user files an appeal; 
(2)  The alarm user who has had ten (10) or more false alarms during the permit year presents satisfactory proof to the alarm administrator that he has taken successful measures to correct the cause of the false alarms; and/or 
(3)  The city receives full payment from the alarm user who is sixty (60) or more days delinquent on payment of any civil fine. 
(e)  Nonresponse status after appeal granted. In the event the appeal is granted and service is restored, an additional false alarm shall cause the service to again enter nonresponse status. Additionally, the false alarm shall be penalized by a civil fine of three hundred dollars ($300.00).

Assessment of any civil penalty and other enforcement decisions may be appealed to the Warner Robins Municipal Court. 
(Ord. No. 20-15, § 9, 7-20-15) 
Sec. 3-35. - Confidentiality. 
In the interest of public safety, all information contained in and gathered through the alarm registration applications, "no response" records, applications for appeals and any other alarm records shall be held in strict confidence by all employees and/or representatives of the city. Because all alarm registration information is considered sensitive public safety information, the same shall not be available to the public, unless otherwise required by law. 
(Ord. No. 20-15, § 10, 7-20-15) 
Sec. 3-36. - Immunity. 
Alarm registration is not intended to, nor will it, create a contract, duty or obligation, either expressed or implied, of response. Any and all liability and consequential damage resulting from the failure to respond to a notification is hereby disclaimed and governmental immunity as provided by law is retained. By registering an alarm system, the alarm user acknowledges that the WRPD response may be influenced by factors such as: the availability of police units, priority of calls, weather conditions, traffic conditions, emergency conditions, staffing levels and prior response history.

(d)  If after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner and any parties in interest that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
(1)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to secure the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
(2)  If the repair, alteration or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
For purposes of this article, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated, provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A., tit. 41, ch. 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
(e)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure, to be repaired, altered, improved, to be vacated and closed, or demolished. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
(f)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and the city are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
(g)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
(1)  The lien provided for in subsection (g) above shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in Houston or Peach County (as appropriate) and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(g). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of Houston or Peach County (as appropriate) and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the county tax commissioner. It shall be the duty of the county tax commissioner to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collection of real property ad valorem tax, including specifically O.C.G.A. tit. 48, ch. 4; provided, however that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires twelve (12) months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the City of Warner Robins. Thirty (30) days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
(2)  The tax commissioner shall collect and retain an amount equal to the cost of administering a lien authorized by O.C.G.A. § 41-2-7, et seq. unless such costs are waived by resolution of Houston or Peach County (as appropriate). Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
(3)  The city may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county or municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property of the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
(4)  Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
(5)  The public officers designated herein may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life, safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and may seek to enforce such citation in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this article. 
(6)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.

DIVISION 2. - BEGGING, PANHANDLING, AND CHARITABLE OR POLITICAL SOLICITATION 

Sec. 10-126. - Purpose and findings. 
The mayor and council do hereby find that: 
(1)  It is the intent of mayor and council in enacting this division to recognize free speech rights for all citizens while at the same time protecting the coexistent rights for all citizens to enjoy safe and convenient travel in public spaces free from intimidating conduct, threats, and harassment that stem from certain types of abusive solicitation, or that may give rise to interference with other's activities if they occur in particular settings and contexts; and 
(2)  Mayor and council find that there are numerous forms of solicitation that are not in and of themselves inherently threatening or aggressive, including vocal requests for a donation; carrying or displaying sign requesting donations; shaking of jingling a cup of change; and ringing a bell in compliance with the city's noise ordinance; and 
(3)  However, mayor and council find that there has been an increase in aggressive solicitation in the city, which threatens the security, privacy, and freedom of movement of both residents and visitors; and 
(4)  Mayor and council also find that the presence of solicitors in certain specific areas (such as near to or adjacent to automatic teller machines, adjacent to outside seating areas, and in public parking lots) create reasonable concerns by citizens objectively worried about their privacy, freedom of movement, and personal security; and 
(5)  Mayor and council further find that certain forms of solicitation impede the orderly flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and leads to concerns regarding traffic and public safety, particularly in congested roadways and sidewalks (as defined below to include highly traveled area, lines to enter buildings, commercial districts with narrow sidewalks or on small traffic medians of high-speed or high-volume streets and highways); and 
(6)  This division is not intended impermissibly to limit an individual's right to exercise free speech associated with solicitation; rather it aims to impose specific time, place, and manner restrictions on solicitation and associated conduct in certain limited circumstances; namely, limiting aggressive panhandling, panhandling at locations or times deemed particularly threatening and dangerous, and panhandling in places where people are a "captive audience" and there is a wish to avoid or reduce a threat of inescapable confrontations; and 
(7)  In promulgating this division, mayor and council seek to impose regulations that are narrowly tailored to serve the aforementioned significant governmental interests. 
(Ord. No. 58-17, § 1, 12-14-17) 
Sec. 10-127. - Definitions.

Sec. 10-128. - Passive begging, panhandling, charitable and political solicitation: when regulated. 
Passive panhandling, begging, charitable or political solicitation permitted except where expressly prohibited. 
The mayor and council find that "passive panhandling, begging, charitable or political solicitation," as defined in section 10-127 of this division, should be treated as speech protected under the First Amendment unless other well-ground governmental concerns are implicated.

(a)  Areas regulated. Areas regulated by this section include those defined as "areas with heightened public safety concerns" as defined in section 10-127 of this division. 
(b)  Findings. The mayor and council find as follows: 
(1)  Public safety. Both aggressive and passive begging, panhandling, charitable or political solicitation within streets and highway rights of way, or on small traffic medians (under eight (8) square feet in size), or on traffic medians located on high speed and high-volume traffic corridors as identified in this division, give rise to an increased risk of injury to solicitors on medians, traffic congestion, and traffic accidents that may affect drivers or solicitors. 
(2)  Alternative sites. This division provides ample alternative sites for passive begging, panhandling, charitable and political solicitation in areas that do not give rise to enhanced public safety concerns or personal privacy and security concerns. 
(3)  Evidence. The city council has undertaken and carefully reviewed studies designed to identify areas in which small traffic medians may put solicitors or motorist at risks, and high speed and high volume traffic corridors that likewise are especially dangerous, in order to assure that those regulations are grounded in appropriate governmental concerns, are narrowly tailored, and allow alternative avenues for communication. 
(c)  Prohibitions. 
(1)  Generally. Both passive and aggressive begging, panhandling, charitable and political solicitation shall be restricted in "areas with heightened public safety concerns" as defined in section 10-127. 
(2)  Exceptions. The mayor and council may identify limited periods each year in which these prohibitions should not be enforced as a result of particularly pressing governmental concerns related to such activities. 
a.  Charitable initiatives. Mayor and council may designate up to sixty (60) days a year as days on which these prohibitions shall not apply in order to allow effective solicitation for designated charities, provided that appropriate safety measures are implemented and a permit issued by the police chief. 
b.  Election activities. The council may designate up to five (5) days a year as days on which these prohibitions shall not apply in order to allow effective political communications in connection with local, state, and federal elections, provided that appropriate safety measures are implemented. 
c.  Documented public safety plan. In the event that the mayor and council designate days as exceptions from this division's requirements, it shall also adopt a documented public safety plan to reduce risks to public safety that might otherwise arise. 
d.  Comparable treatment. To the extent that the mayor and council adopt exceptions to the prohibitions set forth in section 10-131(c)(1), relating to charitable initiatives and election activities, such exceptions shall extend to all parties otherwise covered by the provisions of this division relating to begging, panhandling, charitable and political solicitation.

(c)  The width must be sufficient to provide three-foot minimum width shooting points for ranges with shooting separators and five-foot minimum width points for those without separators. 
(d)  The height at the firing line must be eight-foot minimum from floor to ceiling. 
(e)  The following regulations apply to doors: 
(1)  There shall be no downrange doors into occupied areas. Downrange shall be understood to be from a point three-foot behind the firing line to the bullet trap. If there is more than one firing line the most distant one from the trap governs. 
(2)  There may be downrange doors into unoccupied areas if human egress is not possible. 
(3)  There may be downrange doors into normally unoccupied areas that permit human egress providing that they are equipped with electrical safety devices that will provide an alarm to the firing line if the area is occupied and that will provide an alarm in the area if any of the ordinary range functions are commenced (turning on target lights, target systems, etc.).

(f)  When donations may occur. Employees may donate to the pool at any time throughout the year. 
(g)  Return of excess, unused leave. In the event that the amount of leave donated for the pool to an employee is in excess of leave actually used, the difference will be returned to the pool upon the employee's return to work. 
(h)  Criteria for consideration. The committee will take into consideration the following factors in making a decision about whether to grant sick leave from the pool: 
(1)  The employee's length of service with the city. 
(2)  Whether the employee is in probationary status. Probationary employees shall be eligible to receive donated sick leave in the event of an on-the-job injury. In any other circumstance, probationary employees may receive sick leave from the pool upon recommendation of their department director and approval by the mayor. 
(3)  Whether the employee is in classified service status.

a.  Any involuntary separation not involving delinquency, misconduct or inefficiency, shall be considered a layoff. 
b.  When, for any reason, it becomes necessary to reduce the working force in a department, employees shall be laid off on the basis of the following three (3) factors to be weighed equally: length of service in position, length of service with the city and the average performance rating for the last three (3) years of service or for the entire period if it is less than three (3) years. 
c.  When a department director believes that a certain individual is essential to the efficient operation of the department or organizational unit because the employee possesses special skills or abilities, and the director wishes to retain this individual in preference to a person with a higher rating as provided above, the director shall submit a written request to the human resources director for permission to do so. This request shall justify the director's request by setting forth in detail the specific skills and abilities possessed by the individual and the reasons why the individual is essential to the effective operation of the department. With the approval of the human resources director, the individual may be retained. 
d.  If a classified service employee is scheduled to be laid off, the employee shall be offered another position if a vacancy exists and the employee is qualified to fill the position.

(Code 1977, § 2-7027; Ord. No. 45-90, § 2, 8-6-90; Ord. No. 34-94, 8-1-94; Ord. No. 38-96, § 1, 5-20-96; Ord. No. 19-14, § 1, 7-21-14) 
Sec. 18-43. - Hearing procedures. 
(a)  Administrative law judge. Hearings for employees who have a right of appeal under section 18-42(a) shall be conducted by an administrative law judge appointed by the mayor and council. The ALJ shall be a member in good standing of the State Bar of Georgia. 
(b)  Scheduling, etc. 
(1)  After receipt of a hearing assignment the ALJ shall schedule the hearing to take place within fifteen (15) days of the notice of appeal by the employee and cause appropriate notices to be sent. The time and place of the hearing shall be set after consultation with the employee and department director. 
(2)  For good cause shown the ALJ can continue a hearing for up to twenty (20) days past its originally scheduled date. 
(3)  Not later than ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing, the attorney for the employee shall enter his appearance with the ALJ with copies to the city attorney and human resources director. The employee or his attorney shall also notify the human resources director of all witnesses he intends to call and shall request copies of all documents or other information which has not already been furnished. 
(c)  Group hearings. In situations where two (2) or more employees are charged with violations arising out of the same or related incidents, the ALJ may conduct group hearings if in his discretion he determines that a single hearing will not likely result in confusion and no employee will have his interests substantially prejudiced by a group hearing. 
(d)  Conduct of the hearing. 
(1)  Informality. Hearings shall be conducted in an informal manner with every effort made by the ALJ to avoid the appearance of conducting a trial as in a court of law. 
(2)  Access to pertinent data. The ALJ shall have access to any files, correspondence, memoranda, etc. which he feels might be pertinent to the case and shall have the right of questioning any officers or employees of the city whom he feels may be able to shed light on the circumstances involving the disciplinary action in question. No officer or employee shall be subject to disciplinary action as a result of testimony given in such a hearing except in case of perjury. 
(3)  Witnesses. The employee and department director are entitled to produce and examine witnesses. The city shall make its employees available as witnesses before the ALJ when requested by the ALJ after consideration of a request to him by either the employee or department director. Employees of the city are in a duty status during the time they are made available as witnesses. 
(4)  Examination of witnesses. Upon request by either party, the witnesses shall be placed under the rule of sequestration. All testimony shall be under oath or affirmation. The department director or the city attorney, if representing the department director (but not both), and the affected employee or his representative (but not both) and the ALJ may question witnesses about any matters logically relevant to the charge against the employee and the proper disposition of the matter. The ALJ has authority to limit unproductively long or irrelevant questioning. 
(5)  Conduct of participants. The ALJ may exclude any person from the hearing for contumacious conduct or misbehavior which obstructs the hearing. 
(6)  Scope of hearing. The ALJ shall limit the evidence and testimony at the hearing to (a) the question of whether the employee is guilty of the charge(s) as set forth in the notice of discipline or similar related or lesser included offenses, and (b) the appropriateness of the discipline imposed by the department director. 
(7)  Rules of evidence. The hearing need not be conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence but shall be conducted in a manner conducive to a determination of the truth. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence which responsible persons are accustomed to rely on in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might prohibit the admission of such evidence in a civil action. The rules of privilege shall be effective to the same extent that they are now or hereafter may be recognized in civil actions and irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded. Decisions made by the ALJ shall not be invalidated by any informality in the proceedings. 
(8)  Burden of proof, etc. The burden shall be on the department director to show that his action is supported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is that degree of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind, considering the record as a whole, might accept as adequate to support a conclusion that the matter asserted is true. He shall have the right to open and conclude. 
(e)  Record. The hearing shall be reported by a certified court reporter and if ordered by the human resources director under subsection (g) shall be transcribed verbatim. All documents submitted to and accepted by the ALJ shall be made a part of the record. If the department director submits a document that is accepted, he shall furnish a copy to the employee. If the employee submits a document that is accepted, he/she shall make the document available to the city for reproduction. Any evidence and testimony offered at the hearing, but excluded by the ALJ, shall be described and that description made a part of the record. 
(f)  ALJ's decision. Not later than five (5) days following the hearing, the ALJ shall forward copies of his report to the department director, the affected employee and the human resources director. Each report shall contain the following: 
(1)  Findings of fact and conclusions. The ALJ shall enumerate his findings of facts and conclusions upon all material issues of fact presented at the hearing. Separate conclusions shall specifically set forth whether the employee is guilty of each violation in the notice of discipline or any similar related or lesser included offenses. 
(2)  Recommended disposition. The ALJ shall recommend the appropriate disposition of the case which shall be one of the following: 
a.  Reinstatement with or without all or part of the back pay; 
b.  Written reprimand; 
c.  Further suspension for a stated period of time without back pay to be followed by reinstatement; 
d.  Demotion; 
e.  Reduction in salary; 
f.  Payment of damages for injury to or loss of city property up to the amount originally charged; 
g.  Some combination of the above; 
h.  Termination effective the date of the notice of termination. 
(3)  Effective date. The report shall set forth the date upon which it shall become final in the absence of a request for further review, which date shall be five (5) days from the date of the report. 
(4)  Notice of appeal. The report shall advise both parties that they can request a review by mayor and council of the ALJ's findings and recommended disposition by delivering a notice of appeal to the office of the human resources director within five (5) days from the date of the report. 
(g)  Review of the ALJ's report. 
(1)  The notice of appeal shall specifically set forth the appellant's reasons for requesting the review by setting forth precisely and in what respects the ALJ erred in his findings and recommended disposition. A request for review which states that the appellant desires to "appeal" without enumerating any errors committed by the ALJ is insufficient. The appeal will not be processed, and the employee and department director will be so notified by the human resources director. 
(2)  The human resources director shall review the ALJ's report in light of the specific enumerations of error raised by the appellant and shall, if necessary for a proper review, direct that a verbatim transcript be prepared. 
(3)  The department director and affected employee shall file any written comments or arguments which they desire to make in the human resources director's office within seven (7) days after the filing of the notice of appeal. The review shall be strictly on the record, and there shall be no further hearings before or oral presentations to the mayor and council. 
(4)  Within three (3) days of receipt of any briefs from the employee and department director or the transcript, whichever is later, the human resources director shall transmit a copy of the charges, the transcript, the decision of the ALJ and any briefs to the mayor and council. The employee, department director and the city attorney shall be notified that the record has been transmitted to mayor and council. 
(5)  The findings and order of the mayor and council shall be final and shall be rendered within thirty (30) days after receipt of the case for final action. A majority vote of the mayor and council shall be required to reverse the decision of the administrative law judge.

Sec. 18-44. - Employee indicted, charged or bound over. 
Any employee of the city who is arrested, bound over to a grand jury, charged by accusation, or indicted for any criminal offense shall report same to their supervisor within forty-eight (48) hours. Department directors shall report any such arrest, etc. to the mayor. 
Upon such arrest, accusation or indictment, the department director or mayor, as appropriate, after consulting with the human resources director, and if need, the city attorney, shall determine the appropriate action to be taken as follows: 
(1)  If the offense(s) charged is also an offense against the employment relationship with the city, the appropriate disciplinary action should be instituted and the employee discharged if appropriate. In some cases under this category, it may be necessary to delay final disciplinary action pending disposition of criminal charges. In such a case the employee may be suspended without pay by the mayor after affording the employee appropriate due process rights and the opportunity for a hearing before the mayor to contest the suspension. 
(2)  If the conduct resulting in the criminal charges does not relate directly to the duties of the position held, but is of a serious and aggravated nature so as to interfere with the employment relationship or embarrass the city, the employee may be suspended without pay pending disposition of charges. Appropriate due process rights shall be afforded to the employee including the opportunity for a hearing before the mayor to contest the suspension. 
(3)  If the conduct resulting in the criminal charges is completely unrelated to city employment and will not be likely to damage the employer-employee relationship, the employee should usually be allowed to continue working. 
An employee suspended pending the disposition of criminal charges shall not report to work or be present in his normal work site during the period of suspension. 
If no disciplinary action is taken to suspend or terminate the employee, but he is nevertheless unavailable for work within five (5) calendar days of the institution of criminal charges, the position may be declared vacant and filled in the normal course of filling vacancies.

ARTICLE III. - SEXUAL HARASSMENT 

Sec. 18-61. - Purpose. 
The City of Warner Robins is proud of its professional and congenial work environment, and will take all necessary steps to insure that the work environment remains pleasant for all who work here. All employees must treat each other with courtesy, consideration and professionalism. The City of Warner Robins will not tolerate harassment of any employee by any other employee or supervisor for any reason. This policy applies to all city employees and applicants for employment. In addition, harassment for any discriminatory reason, such as race, sex, national origin, disability, age, or religion, is prohibited by state and federal laws, which may subject the City of Warner Robins and/or the individual harasser to liability for any such unlawful conduct. With this policy, the City of Warner Robins prohibits not only unlawful harassment, but also other unprofessional and discourteous actions. Accordingly, derogatory racial, ethnic, religious, age, sexual or other inappropriate remarks, slurs or jokes will not be tolerated. 
(Res.(1) of 3-1-99, § 2200) 
Sec. 18-62. - Definitions and rules. 
(a)  Sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or any other visual, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, when: 
(1)  Submission to the conduct is made either implicitly or explicitly a condition of the individual's employment; 
(2)  Submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as the basis for an employment decision effecting the harassed employee; or 
(3)  The harassment has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with the employee's work performance or creating an environment that is intimidating, hostile, or offensive to the employee. 
(b)  Each employee must exercise his or her own good judgment to avoid engaging [in] conduct that may be perceived by others as harassment. Forms of harassment include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Verbal. Repeated sexual innuendoes, racial or sexual epithets, derogatory slurs, off-colored jokes, propositions, threats, or suggestive or insulting sounds; 
(2)  Visual/non-verbal. Derogatory posters, cartoon, or drawings; suggestive objects or pictures; graphic commentaries, leering, or obscene gestures; 
(3)  Physical. Unwanted physical contact, including touching, interference with an individual's normal work movement, or assault and/or battery; and 
(4)  Other. Making or threatening reprisals as a result of a negative response to harassment. 
(Res.(1) of 3-1-99, § 2210) 
Sec. 18-63. - Procedures. 
Any employee who believes that he/she is or may be subjected to objectionable conduct must report it immediately to his/her supervisor or to the department of human resources. Do not allow an inappropriate situation to continue by not reporting it, regardless of who is creating that situation. If the employee's supervisor is involved, the employee does not need to contact that individual first but may proceed directly to the director of human resources or the mayor. The City of Warner Robins also will not tolerate employees filing wholly unfounded or frivolous complaints alleging sexual harassment or discrimination. While each complaint will be thoroughly investigated, those complaints having no basis in fact or reality, and those claims brought solely to harass another employee, to tarnish another employee's reputation, or to "get back" at another employee are strictly prohibited and may result in discipline up to and including discharge. 
Upon receipt of an allegation of sexual harassment or any other form of harassment prohibited herein, the city will make a prompt, thorough and objective investigation of the allegation. This investigation will respect the rights of both the accuser and the accused. The assistant city attorney for human resources will conduct the investigation. The investigation will be completed in an expeditious manner and if at all possible within five (5) working days. 
At the conclusion of the investigation the mayor, department director, and the assistant city attorney for human resources will make a determination as to whether the complaint was founded or unfounded. If unfounded, the complaint will be dismissed and if found to be wholly unfounded or frivolous appropriate discipline may be taken against the accuser. If the complaint is determined to be true then the mayor, department director and the assistant city attorney for human resources will promptly formulate a plan for remedial action for the situation. This remedial plan may include, but is not limited to, separation of the parties, counseling for the offending party and any other disciplinary action allowed by the personnel rules and regulations up to and including termination. Each case will be judged on its own merits on a case by case basis. The severity of the remedial action will be based upon the seriousness of the conduct. 
Any employee who brings such a complaint to the attention of the city, in good faith, will not be adversely effected as a result of reporting the harassment. The city will preserve the confidentiality of harassment complainants and witnesses as much as possible consistent with a thorough investigation. Once an investigation is initiated, confidentiality may no longer be practicable or [in] the best interest of the city in light of open records laws or the need to quell gossip that can affect employee morale, reputation and working efficiency. To encourage candor and cooperation during the investigative process, however, the final report and all supporting data, including transcripts of written summaries of statements by witnesses, will be available only to those who, in the judgment of the mayor or his designee, have a bona fide need to know and to those legally entitled to disclosure. 
(Res.(1) of 3-1-99, § 2220) 
Sec. 18-64. - Prohibition against retaliation. 
Retaliation against an employee for protesting or reporting violations or apparent violations of this policy, or for filing a complaint, will not be tolerated. Any person found to have retaliated against an employee is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.

ARTICLE II. - MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR EROSION, SEDIMENTATION AND POLLUTION CONTROL USING BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES 

Sec. 21-21. - General provisions. 
Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the chapter and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of section IV B. & C. of this chapter. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this chapter and the NPDES general permit. 
(Ord. No. 10-10, § 1(IV.A), 2-16-10; Ord. No. 24-16, 9-6-16) 
Sec. 21-22. - Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(a)  Best management practices as set forth in section IV B. & C. of this chapter shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (b) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6(b). 
(b)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
(c)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land- disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(d)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(e)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in 21-23(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 (c). 
(Ord. No. 10-10, § 1(IV.B), 2-16-10; Ord. No. 24-16, 9-6-16) 
Sec. 21-23. - Minimum requirements. 
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 21-22(2) of this chapter; 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a twenty-five-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a fifty-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a twenty-five-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single—family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(17)  There is established a twenty-five (25) foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with chapter 5 of title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single—family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a twenty-five-foot buffer would consume at least eighteen (18) percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than five hundred (500) square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than five thousand (5,000) square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least fourteen (14) days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities.

DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 23-46. - Purpose and intent. 
The City of Warner Robins recognizes and supports the public's right of assembly and free speech and to utilize designated public facilities for such purposes. At the same time, the city has an important and compelling governmental interest in protecting property, public safety, health and welfare, and controlling use of streets and other public facilities and venues. This article seeks to accommodate public rights of speech and assembly consistent with that governmental interest by establishing procedures, terms, and conditions for use of public areas and facilities for such purposes. A second purpose of this article is to facilitate and manage the manner in which public facilities that are not otherwise required for governmental operations may be made available for use on a temporary basis for non-governmental operations. 
(Ord. No. 15-12, §§ 1, 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 23-47. - Scope; authority. 
This article applies to all public parades and assemblies that may be expected to affect the public, the property or services of the city, to otherwise require an expenditure of time and expenses or create the potential for liability or public disturbance or other substantial concern. This article also applies to requests for use of public facilities for purposes other than governmental operations. This article is adopted in accordance with the authority vested in the city by its Charter, Article IX, Section II, Paragraphs II and III of the Georgia Constitution, O.C.G.A. § 36-35-3 and all other applicable state and federal law.

(e)  Requirements for insurance, bonding or other security. To avoid interference with protected rights of speech and assembly, any requirement imposed for surety for performance (including but not limited to insurance, bonding, or monetary deposits) shall be based upon needs directly associated with the event and not on the basis of possible disruption of the event by protestors or other persons who might be opposed to the speech or assembly. 
(Ord. No. 15-12, §§ 1, 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 23-52. - Standard application process.

The administrator may amend any application form in whole or in part on such notice as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances, provided that an amendment shall not apply to an application made prior to the administrator's formal notice of any proposed amendment to the application form. 
(c)  Without limiting the authority of the administrator to require reasonable additional information in connection with any specific application, such forms shall require the applicant to identify: 
(1)  The name, address, and telephone number of the person or the agent or representative of an organization or entity seeking to obtain the permit. 
(2)  The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the headquarters or business location of the organization seeking the permit or organizing or sponsoring the event or activity, if any, and the authorized and responsible heads of the organization. 
(3)  If the application is filed by any person other than an individual applying on the individual's own behalf, the application shall include written authorization from that other person or from a responsible, legally authorized representative of an organizational applicant authorizing the applicant to apply for the permit on its behalf. 
(4)  The requested date, time, and location for the event or activity. 
a.  The location description also shall identify the content of the public and private areas that will be involved in the activity or event. 
b.  The time shall include the time during which the event or activity will be conducted and the time(s) during which preparation, set-up, assembly, clean-up or other actions may occur.

Sec. 23-53. - Expedited or extended application review. 
(a)  Upon request of an applicant, the administrator may agree to an expedited application review when the applicant demonstrates that compliance with the standard review process (1) is not required due to size, location, duration, or other appropriate factors, indicating that public safety, welfare, and convenience would not be affected by expedited review or (2) would substantially burden protected rights, including speech and assembly, as to matters of public concern and the expedited review process would allow reasonable review to address substantial matters of public safety, welfare, and convenience. 
(b)  Upon determining that the size, location, duration, or other appropriate factors that affect public safety, welfare, and convenience, require more intensive review of an application, the administrator, after notice to the applicant, may extend the standard review period by a time not to exceed forty-eight (48) hours. 
(Ord. No. 15-12, §§ 1, 2, 4-16-12) 
Sec. 23-54. - Fees.

(a)  Police protection. 
(1)  If possible, without disruption of ordinary police services or compromise of public safety and welfare, regularly scheduled on-duty police personnel shall cover the event. The administrator shall seek review of any application which might require additional police personnel by the police chief. 
(2)  When reviewing an application, the police chief shall determine whether and to what extent additional police protection is reasonably necessary for the event for traffic control and public safety and welfare, including public convenience. The police chief shall base this decision on relevant criteria including, but not limited to, the size, location, duration, time and date of the event; the expected sale or serving of alcoholic beverages; the number of streets and intersections blocked; and the need to detour or preempt public travel and use of streets and sidewalks. 
(3)  The speech content of the event shall not be a factor in determining the amount of police protection necessary. 
(4)  If additional police protection for the event is deemed necessary by the police chief, he shall so inform the administrator and applicant. The applicant shall be responsible for bearing the cost of the additional police protection deemed necessary by the police chief. The chief may, but is not required to, approve use of private security details, to be paid for by the applicant, in lieu of any or all special detail city police services that might otherwise be required under this section. 
(b)  Public works. In the same manner, the city shall determine if the applicant shall be required to pay for or provide additional public works-related actions such as lighting, refuse receptacle and pick-up, sanitary facilities, traffic control signs, devices, or personnel. 
(c)  Other expenses. In circumstances where the event itself may be expected to cause the city to incur additional, extraordinary expenses, the administrator shall identify such expenses and the basis for determining them to be extraordinary. Such expenses may be imposed upon the applicant as a condition of approval of the permit. 
(d)  Expense exception. An applicant for an event conducted for the sole purpose of public issue speech protected under the First Amendment or the Georgia Constitution as determined by the administrator shall not be required to pay for police protection or public works or other expense for actions provided by the city. However, the applicant shall obtain a permit as required by this article.

(1)  The application is complete and sets forth accurately and in sufficient detail the information required for consideration. 
(2)  Conduct of the event will not unduly inconvenience either the public in using public areas normally open for general public use or the city in the conduct of governmental operations.

(2)  Backflow preventer. A device or means to prevent backflow. 
(b)  Minimum required airgap. 
(1)  How measured. The minimum required airgap shall be measured vertically from the lowest end of a potable water outlet to the flood rim or line of the fixture or receptacle into which it discharges. 
(2)  Size. The minimum required airgap shall be twice the effective opening of a potable water outlet unless the outlet is a distance less than three (3) times the effective opening away from a wall or similar vertical surface, in which cases the minimum required airgap shall be three (3) times the effective opening of the outlet. In no case shall the minimum required airgap be less than shown in the Standard Plumbing Code. 
(c)  Approval of devices. Before any device for the prevention of backflow or backsiphonage is installed, it shall have first been certified by a recognized testing laboratory acceptable to the city. Devices installed in a building potable water supply distribution system for protection against backflow shall be maintained in good working condition by the person responsible for the maintenance of the system. The city shall inspect routinely such devices and if found to be defective or inoperative shall require the replacement thereof. 
(d)  Installation of devices. 
(1)  Vacuum breakers. Vacuum breakers shall be installed with the critical level at least six (6) inches above the flood-level rim of the fixture they serve and on the discharge side of the last control valve to the fixture. No shutoff valve or faucet shall be installed beyond the vacuum breaker. For closed equipment or vessels such as pressure sterilizers the top of the vessel shall be treated as the flood-level rim but a check valve shall be installed on the discharge side of the vacuum breaker. 
(2)  Reduced pressure principle backflow preventer. A reduced pressure principle type backflow preventer may be installed subject to full static pressure. 
(3)  Devices of all types. Backflow and backsiphonage preventing devices shall be accessibly located preferably in the same room with the fixture they serve. Installation in utility or service spaces, provided they are readily accessible, is permitted. Vacuum breakers and backflow preventers equipped with atmosphere vents or with relief openings shall be so installed and so located as to prevent any vent or any relief opening from being submerged. The preventing devices shall be installed in the position as required by the manufacturer and shall be protected from freezing. 
(4)  Thermal expansion control. Where water is heated in a distribution system or a branch of the system that has been provided a vacuum breaker or backflow preventer, a thermal expansion control device shall be installed between the vacuum breaker or backflow preventer and the water heater to limit the static pressure increase due to thermal expansion of the heated water. 
(e)  Tanks and vats: below rim supply. 
(1)  Where a potable water outlet terminates below the rim of a tank or vat and the tank or vat has an overflow of diameter not less than given in the Standard Plumbing Code, the overflow pipe shall be provided with an airgap as close to the tank as possible. 
(2)  The potable water outlet to the tank or vat shall terminate a distance not less than one and one-half (1½) times the height to which water can rise in the tank above the top of the overflow. This level shall be established at the maximum flow rate of the supply to the tank or vat and with all outlets except the airgap overflow outlet closed. 
(3)  The distance from the outlet to the high water level shall be measured from the critical point of the potable water supply outlet. 
(f)  Connections not subject to backpressure. Where a water connection is not subject to backpressure, a vacuum breaker shall be installed on the discharge side of the last valve on the line serving the fixture or equipment. 
(g)  Connections subject to backpressure. Where a potable water connection is made to a line, fixture, tank, vat, pump or other equipment with a hazard of backflow or backsiphonage where the water connection is subject to backpressure, and an airgap cannot be installed, the city shall classify the connection as to the degree of hazard and shall require the installation of backflow preventers required by the degree of hazard as set forth in subsection (d)(3) of this section. Such connections include, but are not limited to, chemical lines, individual water supplies, industrial process water lines, pressure tanks, pumps, steam lines, swimming pools, tanks and vats (bottom inlets), and hose bibbs. 
(h)  Barometric loop. Water connections where an actual or potential backsiphonage hazard exists may in lieu of devices specified above be provided with a barometric loop. Barometric loops shall precede the point of connection. 
(i)  Low pressure cutoff required on booster pumps. When a booster pump is used on a water pressure booster system and the possibility exists that a positive pressure of 10 psi or less may occur on the suction side of the pump, there shall be installed a low-pressure cutoff on the booster pump to prevent the creation of a vacuum or negative pressure on the suction side of the pump, thus cutting off water to other outlets. 
(Code 1977, § 5-2059(d)(9)) 
Sec. 24-127. - Maintenance requirements. 
(a)  Generally. It shall be the responsibility of building and premises owners to maintain all backflow preventers and vacuum breakers within the building or on the premises in good working order and to make no piping or other arrangements for the purpose of bypassing backflow devices. 
(b)  Backflow preventer. Periodic testing and inspection schedules shall be established by the city for all backflow preventers and the interval between such testing and inspections and overhauls of each such device shall be established in accordance with the age and condition of the device. Inspection intervals should not exceed one (1) year, and overhaul intervals should not exceed five (5) years. These devices should be inspected frequently after the initial installation to assure that they have been installed properly and that debris resulting from the installation has not interfered with the functioning of the device. The testing procedures shall be in accordance with the device manufacturer's instructions.

Sec. 24-224. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(a)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the utility director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 24-220 of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 24-216, 24-218, and 24-219 of this article. 
(b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the utility director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(e)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least twenty (20) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 55, 5-8-97) 
Sec. 24-236. - Compliance orders. 
When the utility director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the utility director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 56, 5-8-97) 
Sec. 24-237. - Cease and desist orders.

(b)  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the utility director to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within twenty (20) days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the utility director may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The utility director may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
(c)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 58, 5-8-97) 
Sec. 24-239. - Emergency suspensions. 
The utility director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The utility director may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The utility director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the utility director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in section 24-240 of this article are initiated against the user. 
(2)  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the utility director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 24-235 or 24-240 of this article. 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 59, 5-8-97) 
Sec. 24-240. - Termination of discharge. 
In addition to the provisions in section 24-213 of this article, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(1)  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
(2)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;

(Ord. No. 56-97, § 63, 5-8-97) 
Sec. 24-244. - Remedies nonexclusive. 
The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. The utility director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the Warner Robins enforcement response plan. However, the utility director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the utility director is empowered to take more than one (1) enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 64, 5-8-97) 
Sec. 24-245. - Upset. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (c), below, are met. 
(c)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
(3)  The user has submitted the following information to the utility director within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset. 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time thee noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days. 
(d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(e)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(f)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 65, 5-8-97) 
Sec. 24-246. - Prohibited discharge standards. 
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 24-194(a) of this article or the specific prohibitions in sections 24-194(b)(3) through 24-194(b)(15) of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(Ord. No. 56-97, § 66, 5-8-97) 
Sec. 24-247. - Bypass. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, 
(1)  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
(2)  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. 
(c)  (1)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the utility director, at least ten (10) days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A user shall submit oral notice to the utility director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The utility director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(d)  (1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the utility director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (c) of this section. 
(2)  The utility director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the utility director determines that it will meet the three (3) conditions listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 56-97, §§ 1—10, adopted May 8, 1997, set out new sewer use and sewage disposal regulations. Inasmuch as there were no user charge provisions included in that ordinance, the former provisions of Div. 2, §§ 24-196—24-201 and 24-216—24-221, User charges, have been included in the Code as Div. 3, §§ 24-263—24-268 and 24-274—24-279, at the direction of the city. 

Subdivision I. - General Provisions 

Sec. 24-263. - Single-family residential service. 
There shall be a monthly base charge of six dollars and eighty cents ($6.80) per account for single-family residential sewer service, plus a volume charge shall be fourteen and five-tenths cents ($.145) per one hundred (100) gallons of water used. Where appropriate, the following policies shall apply: 
(1)  A new single-family residential wastewater customer joining the system during November through April shall be charged based upon actual water consumption. Such customer's maximum monthly volume billing during the subsequent May through October period shall be based upon the system average monthly volume for single-family residential customers, vis., 8.4 K gallons. In subsequent months, the above method of billing existing customers applies. On a case-by-case basis, the city should evaluate such new connection prior to the May through October billings; if the city determines that a typical usage pattern has been established by such new connections, the average of the number of months of such typical consumption shall apply as the May through October maximum. 
(2)  A new single-family residential wastewater customer joining the system during May through October shall be charged based upon the system average November through April monthly consumption, vis., 8.4 K gallons. During the subsequent November through April period, the charge is based upon actual water consumption. 
(3)  In the event that a given single-family residential connection exhibits clearly nontypical monthly consumption in some or all months during April through November, then the city shall adjust the maximum monthly volume for May through October on a case-by-case basis in order to achieve adequate accuracy of billing. For example, a given connection might have zero consumption for one (1) or more months in which case the average consumption would be based upon the reduced number of months for which usage is typical for such connection. If there are reliable grounds for the city to declare all monthly consumption during April through November for a given connection to be nontypical, then the monthly maximum volume for May through October shall be the above referenced system average for single-family residential connections for the period, vis., 8.4 K gallons.

Sec. 24-278. - Wastewater volume charge. 
(a)  The wastewater volume charge shall be as follows: 
(l)  Single-family residential: November through April: One dollar and forty-five cents ($1.45) per thousand gallons actual water consumption; May through October: One dollar and forty-five cents ($1.45) per thousand gallons actual water consumption, up to a maximum equal to each customer's monthly average November through April water consumption; 
(2)  Multi-family residential: One dollar and forty-five cents ($1.45) per thousand gallons actual water consumption; 
(3)  Commercial/industrial: Two dollars and twelve cents ($2.12) per thousand gallons actual water consumption. 
(b)  When applicable, the following policies shall apply to single-family residential customers: 
(1)  A new single-family residential wastewater customer joining the system during November through April shall be charged based upon actual water consumption. Said customer's maximum monthly volume billing during the subsequent May through October period shall be based upon the system average monthly volume for single-family residential customers, vis., 8.4 K gallons. In subsequent months, the above method of billing existing customers applies. On a case-by-case basis, the city should evaluate such new connection prior to May through October billings; if the city determines that a typical usage pattern has been established by said new connections, the average of the number of months of such typical consumption shall apply as the May through October maximum. 
(2)  A new single-family residential wastewater customer joining the system during May through October shall be charged based upon the system average November through April monthly consumption, vis., 8.4 K gallons. During the subsequent November through April period, the charge is based upon actual water consumption. 
(3)  In the event that a given single-family residential connection exhibits clearly nontypical monthly consumption in some or all months during April through November, then the city shall adjust the maximum monthly volume for May through October on a case-by-case basis in order to achieve adequate accuracy of billing. For example, a given connection might have zero consumption for one (1) or more months in which case the average consumption would be based upon the reduced number of months for which usage is typical for said connection. If there are reliable grounds for the city to declare all monthly consumption during April through November for a given connection to be nontypical, then the monthly maximum volume for May through October shall be the above referenced system average for single-family residential connections for the period, vis., 8.4 K gallons.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 26-05, §§ 1—5, adopted May 2, 2005, did not specify manner of codification. Therefore, at the discretion of the editor, with the concurrence of the city, these provisions have been added to the Code as Art. IX, §§ 24-351—24-256, to read as set out herein. 

Sec. 24-351. - Purpose. 
The intent of this section is to establish minimum development standards and criteria which will afford reasonable protection of environmentally sensitive natural resources found throughout the city. It has been determined the wise management of these resources as defined in this section is essential to maintaining the health, safety, general welfare and economic well being of the public. 
(Ord. No. 26-05, § 1, 5-2-05) 
Sec. 24-352. - Establishment of water resource districts. 
The city's water resource districts shall include the following: 
Groundwater recharge area district. 
Wetlands protection district. 
The boundaries of these water resource districts are shown on a set of maps designated as "water resource districts" and are included as part of the city's official zoning map, which is on file with the zoning administrator's office located in the city hall. 
(Ord. No. 26-05, § 2, 5-2-05) 
Sec. 24-353. - Definitions. 
In addition to the general definitions provided in this article, the following definitions shall apply to this section: 
Aquifer: Any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
Drastic: The standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Document EPA-600-87-035 (Note: The Drastic methodology is most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility). 
Generalized wetlands map: The current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps for the City of Warner Robins, Georgia. 
Jurisdictional wetland: An area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
Jurisdictional wetland determination: A delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33.U.S.C. § 1344, as amended. 
Pollution susceptibility: The relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. 
Pollution susceptibility map: The relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the Department of Natural Resources using the Drastic methodology. (Georgia Department of Natural Resources Hydrologic Atlas 20: Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia.) 
Recharge area: Any portion of the earth's surface where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
Regulated activity: Any activity which will or which may reasonably be expected to result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
Significant recharge areas: Those areas mapped by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 Edition). 
Water resource districts: A water resource district is a map overlay which imposes a set of requirements in addition to those of the underlying zoning district. 
Wetlands: Those areas inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrological vegetation and hydrological conditions involving a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. 
(Ord. No. 26-05, § 3, 5-2-05) 
Sec. 24-354. - Groundwater recharge area district. 
(a)  Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides, sprayed on crops, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures. 
(c)  District delineation. The groundwater recharge area district is delineated according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' "Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 Edition)." Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the "Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map Atlas 20, 1992 Edition." Said maps are hereby adopted and made a part of this article. 
(d)  Permitted uses. All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts are permitted in the groundwater recharge area protection district. The following are additional requirements for specific uses: 
(1)  New aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of six hundred sixty (660) gallons, shall have secondary containment for one hundred ten (110) percent of the volume of such tanks or one hundred ten (110) percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
(2)  New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within: 
a.  A high pollution susceptibility area; 
b.  A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed fifteen (15) acre-feet in size; and 
c.  A low pollution susceptibility area and exceed fifty (50) acre-feet in size. 
As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one-foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 × 10 -7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the National Resource and Conservation Service. 
(3)  New homes served by septic tank/drain field systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified on Table MT-1 of the Department of Human Resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereafter DHR Table MT-1). The minimum set forth in Table MT-1 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in subsections (3)(1) through (6)) of the DHR Manual. 
a.  One hundred fifty (150) percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
b.  One hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; 
c.  One hundred ten (110) percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
(4)  New manufactured home parks served by septic tank/drain field systems shall have lots or spaces having the following size limitation as identified on Table MT-2 of the department of human resources' (DHR) Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereafter DHR Table MT-2). The minimums set forth in Table MT-2 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in subsections (d)(1) through (6)) of the DHR Manual.

(Ord. No. 26-05, § 4, 5-2-05) 
Sec. 24-355. - Wetlands protection district. 
(a)  Findings of fact. The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constrains due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; natural resource education; scientific study, and recreational opportunities. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas. 
(c)  District delineation. The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city, that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon as attached thereto. 
The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands with the city and cannot necessarily serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this Ordinance does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
(d)  Wetland development permit requirements. No regulated activity or use except those identified in subsection (e) shall be allowed within the wetland protection district without a development permit from the city. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary as determined by the zoning enforcement officer using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the development permit will not be granted until Section 404 Permit or Letter of Permission is issued. 
(e)  Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted by right within the wetland protection district to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging as provided herein. (These activities listed in this section are exempted from Section 404 regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 Permit. However, under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances.) 
(1)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
(2)  Conservation or preservation soil, water, vegetation, fish or other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the State of Georgia or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
(3)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
(4)  The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. 
(5)  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed, and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
(6)  Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
(f)  Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited in a wetland district: 
(1)  Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants. 
(2)  Hazardous or sanitary landfills.

TABLE MT-1 
NEW HOMES  MINIMUM LOT SIZES, MINIMUM LOT WIDTHS AND MAXIMUM  ALLOWABLE SEWAGE FLOW FOR THE TYPE OF  WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM 

 
*In this context, "Non-Public" means an individual water supply system or any other water supply system which is not a "public" water supply system. 
**Gpad = gallons per acre per day = gal/acre/day. 
TABLE MT-2 
MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS  MINIMUM LOT SIZES, MINIMUM LOT WIDTHS AND MAXIMUM  ALLOWABLE SEWAGE FLOW FOR THE TYPE OF  WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM 

 
*In this context, "non-public" means an individual water supply system or any other water supply system which is not a "public" water supply system. 
**Gpad = gallons per acre per day = gal/acre/day. 
Section A. The above minimum lot sizes are for the typical size home (three (3) or four (4) bedroom) with basic appurtenances such as: driveway, minimum number of trees and water supply line. If larger homes, swimming pools, tennis courts or outbuildings, etc. are proposed for construction or if trees would interfere with installation of an on-site sewage management system, the Houston County Board of Health will require larger lots to assure usable soil area. 
Section B. The Houston County Board of Health may also require larger lot sizes when physical factors indicate the need to do so. These factors include, but are not limited to, the availability of sufficient unobstructed land areas for an approved on-site sewage management system and approved replacement system, slope greater than five (5) percent, percolation rates higher than forty-five (45) minutes per inch, need for subsurface drainage or adverse topographic features. 
Section C. Lots shall be a minimum width of one hundred (100) feet or one hundred fifty (150) feet measured within the area where an approved on-site sewage management system and replacement system are to be located when served by a public water supply system or nonpublic water supply system, respectively. 
Section D. The following land areas are not considered as a part of a lot when calculating the required minimum lot size: rights-of-way of roads, easements (such as power line or pipe line) that exclude installation of an on-site sewage management system, bodies of water, land within fifty (50) feet of a lake, river, stream, wetland or other bodies of water and similar limiting factors. 
Section E. There must be an unobstructed area on each lot for installation of an approved on-site sewage management system and an area equal in size for a conventional system or larger area, as appropriate, for an approved replacement system; this will include sufficient area for necessary site modifications for installation of both the initial system and a replacement system. All pertinent county zoning setbacks and other space requirements must also be met. 
Section F. The maximum daily sewage flow for each lot or parcel of land shall not exceed six hundred (600) gpad when served by non-public or individual water supply system or one thousand two hundred (1,200) gpad when served by public water supply system. When sewage flows exceed these quantities (six hundred (600) or one thousand two hundred (1,200) gpad as indicated) for a given dwelling structure, the minimum lot size or parcel of land shall be increased proportionally. Example: Assume a public water supply exists (so one thousand two hundred (1,200) gpad maximum sewage flow allowed per minimum required land area of twenty-one thousand seven hundred eighty (21,780) square feet), and there is a proposed sewage flow of five thousand (5,000) gpd. To determine the square footage of the lot needed, X, use the following formula: 
X = 5,000 gal/day/1,200 gal/acre/day 
= 4.17 acres 
= 4.17 acres × 43,560 ft 2 /acre 
= 181,500 ft 2 area of land needed. 
Likewise, for a nonpublic (individual) water supply, to determine the square footage of the lot needed, Y, for a proposed sewage flow of five thousand (5,000) gpd, use the following formula: 
Y = 5,000 gal/day/600 gal/acre/day 
= 8.33 acres 
= 8.33 acres × 43,560 ft 2 /acre 
= 363,000 ft 2 area of land needed.

ARTICLE X. - STORMWATER[9] 
Footnotes: 
--- (9) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 28-06, adopted May 15, 2006, did not specify manner of codification. At the instruction of the city, these provisions have been included as Art. X, to read as set out herein. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 24-376. - General provisions. 
(a)  Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that: 
(1)  Land development and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
(2)  This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants; and 
(3)  Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites. 
Therefore, the city establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. This article seeks to meet that purpose through regulation of activities that can through proper regulation improve and maintain those water resources that lie partially or wholly within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city. 
(c)  Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements. This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The requirements of this ordinance should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence. 
(d)  Severability. The provisions of this article are hereby declared to be severable. If any provision, clause, sentence, or paragraph of this article or the application thereof to any person, establishment, or circumstances shall be held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the other provisions or application of this article. 
(e)  Responsibility for administration. Unless otherwise stated, the city shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article. Any powers granted or duties imposed upon the city engineer may be delegated by the city engineer to persons or entities acting under the authority of the city. 
(f)  Effects of compliance. The standards set forth herein pursuant to this article unless otherwise noted are minimum standards; therefore this article does not intend nor imply that compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no adverse effect with regard to water quality and quantity.

(2)  Temporary seeding, producing short-term vegetative cover; or 
(3)  Sodding, covering areas with a turf of perennial sod-forming grass. 
Watercourse. Any natural or manmade conveyance channel, stream, river, creek, channel, ditch, canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, ravine, or wash in which stormwater flows either continuously or intermittently and which has a definite channel, bed and banks, and including any areas adjacent thereto subject to inundation by reason of overflow or floodwater. 
Wetlands. Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation.

Sec. 24-386. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent practicable. The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) by stormwater discharges by any user; 
(2)  To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the MS4; and 
(3)  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection; surveillance and monitoring; and enforcement procedures as necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
(b)  Applicability. This article shall apply to all non-stormwater discharges entering the storm drain system generated on any developed or undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by the city under section 24-387. 
(Ord. No. 28-06, Art. III(1), 5-15-06) 
Sec. 24-387. - Discharge prohibitions. 
(a)  Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the MS4 or watercourses any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. 
The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows: 
(1)  The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this article: water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated - typically less than one PPM chlorine), fire fighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants. 
(2)  Discharges specified in writing by the city engineer as being necessary to protect public health and safety. 
(3)  Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the city engineer twenty-four (24) hours prior to the time of the test followed by written notice within ten (10) days. 
(4)  Any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the city engineer prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
(5)  Any stormwater discharge regulated under an NPDES stormwater discharge permit for industrial activities provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the city engineer prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
(6)  Any stormwater discharge regulated under an NPDES stormwater discharge permit for construction activities or other local land disturbance permit provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the city engineer prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
(b)  Prohibition of illicit connections. The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the MS4 or watercourses is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 
(Ord. No. 28-06, Art. III(2), 5-15-06) 
Sec. 24-388. - Suspension of MS4 access. 
(a)  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The city engineer may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge that presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or Waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city engineer may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(b)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 or watercourses in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city engineer will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the city engineer for a reconsideration and hearing. 
A person commits a violation of this division if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior written approval of the city engineer. 
(Ord. No. 28-06, Art. III(3), 5-15-06) 
Sec. 24-389. - Monitoring of discharges. 
(a)  Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity. 
(b)  Access to facilities. 
(1)  The city engineer shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this division. If a discharger has security measures in force, which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the city engineer. 
(2)  Facility operators shall allow the city engineer ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
(3)  The city engineer shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the city engineer to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
(4)  The city engineer has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(5)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the city engineer and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
(6)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the city engineer access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this division. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits a violation if the person denies the city engineer reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this division. 
(7)  If the city engineer has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the city may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 28-06, § III(4), 5-15-06) 
Sec. 24-390. - Requirement to prevent, control and reduce stormwater pollutants. 
(a)  Specification of best management practices. The city may adopt requirements identifying best management practices for any activity, operation, or facility, which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the MS4 or watercourses, or waters of the U.S. 
(b)  Pollution prevention in new facilities. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. 
(c)  Pollution prevention in existing facilities. Any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4 or watercourses. 
(d)  Discharge permits from regulatory agencies other than the city. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. BMPs designated for compliance with the NPDES permit or BMPs implemented as a result of action taken in compliance of this article shall be included in a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 
(Ord. No. 28-06, § III(5), 5-15-06) 
Sec. 24-391. - Watercourse protection. 
Every person owning property through which stormwater flows, either continuously or intermittently, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
(Ord. No. 28-06, § III(6), 5-15-06) 
Sec. 24-392. - Notification of spills. 
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the MS4 or watercourses, or water of the U.S. said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the city engineer in person, by phone, facsimile or email no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the city engineer within three (3) business days of the phone notice. The notification of the discharge of materials to the city engineer shall be in addition to notification of other applicable city, regional, state and federal authorities. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three (3) years. 
(Ord. No. 28-06, § III(7), 5-15-06) 
Sec. 24-393. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Notice of violation. Whenever the city engineer finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, the city engineer may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible party. Such notice may require without limitation: 
(1)  The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting; 
(2)  The elimination of illicit connections or discharges; 
(3)  That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist; 
(4)  The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; 
(5)  Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and 
(6)  The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. 
If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the work may be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator. 
(b)  Appeal of notice of violation. Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of the city engineer to the local magistrate court. The notice of appeal must be received within ten (10) days from the date of the notice of violation. Hearing on the appeal before the appropriate authority or his/her designee shall take place within fifteen (15) days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the reviewing authority or their designee shall be final. 
(c)  Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within ten (10) days of the decision of the reviewing authority upholding the decision of the city engineer then representatives of the city engineer shall enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the city engineer or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above. 
(d)  Cost of abatement of the violation. Within thirty (30) days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within thirty (30) days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the reviewing authority or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. 
(e)  Injunctive relief. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this division. If a person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this division, the city engineer may petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation. 
(f)  Compensatory action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this division, the city may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc. 
(g)  Violations deemed a public nuisance. In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this article is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken. 
(h)  Criminal prosecution. Any person that has violated or continues to violate this article shall be liable to criminal prosecution to the fullest extent of the law, and shall be subject to the maximum criminal penalty provided by law. 
The city may recover all attorneys' fees, court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement of this article, including sampling and monitoring expenses. 
(i)  Remedies not exclusive. The remedies listed in this article are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is within the discretion of the authorized enforcement agency to seek cumulative remedies.

Secs. 24-394—24-400. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 3. - POST CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER RUNOFF 

Sec. 24-401. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this division is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. This division seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)  Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream and drainage channels; 
(2)  Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality; 
(3)  Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable; and 
(4)  Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety. 
(b)  Applicability. This division shall be applicable to all development plan applications, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by the city engineer under the specifications of division 24-403. This division also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development that meets the following applicability criteria, even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
(1)  New development that involves the creation of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of impervious cover, or that disturbs one acre or more of land; 
(2)  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one (1) acre or more; 
(3)  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the city engineer to be a hotspot land use; or 
(4)  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in items a. and b. above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
(5)  Any development project regardless of size deemed by the city engineer that shall contribute to a known or suspected water quality or quantity impairment. 
(c)  Exempt activities. The following activities are exempt from this division: 
(1)  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project; 
(2)  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
(3)  Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; and 
(4)  Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the city engineer. 
When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a redevelopment project as defined in section 24-377, decisions on permitting and on-site stormwater requirements shall be governed by special stormwater sizing criteria found in the current local stormwater design manual (LDM). This criteria is dependent on the amount of impervious area created by the redevelopment and its impact on water quality. Final authorization of all redevelopment projects will be determined after a review by the city engineer. 
(d)  Development of a local stormwater design manual (LDM). The city may furnish additional policy, criteria and information including specifications and standards, for the proper implementation of the requirements of this article and will provide such information in the form of a LDM. The LDM will serve to supplement and/or clarify information set forth in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
The LDM will include a list of acceptable stormwater treatment practices, including the specific design criteria and operation and maintenance requirements for each stormwater practice. The manual may be updated and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the city, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring and local maintenance experience. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed and constructed in accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards during the design and permitting phase of a land development project. 
(Ord. No. 28-06, art. IV(1), 5-15-06) 
Sec. 24-402. - Permit procedures and requirements. 
(a)  Permit required. No land owner or land operator shall receive any of the building, grading or other land development permits required for land disturbance activities without first meeting the requirements of this article prior to commencing the proposed activity. 
(b)  Application requirements. Unless specifically excluded by this article, any landowner or operator desiring a permit for a land disturbance activity shall submit to the city a permit application on a form provided for that purpose. Unless otherwise excepted by this article, a permit application must include the minimum requirements as defined in this article or LDM in order for the permit application to be considered. 
(c)  Application review fees. The city may require the submittal of a review fee for review of the stormwater management plan. This review fee shall be based on the amount of land to be disturbed at the site or number of lots, and the fee structure shall be established by the mayor and council. All of the monetary contributions shall be credited to a local budgetary category to support local plan review, inspection and program administration, and all fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of any development permits. 
(d)  Application procedure. All applications received by the city will be received and processed in the manner outlined in the zoning and subdivision ordinance of the city. 
(e)  Permit duration. Permits issued under this section shall be valid from the date of issuance through the date the city engineer notifies the permit holder that all stormwater management practices have passed the final inspection required under permit condition. Should no activity take place on the site, the permit shall expire within one (1) year of issuance. 
(Ord. No. 28-06, Art. IV(2), 5-15-06) 
Sec. 24-403. - Waivers to stormwater management requirements. 
(a)  Waivers for providing stormwater management. Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required by this division, unless a written request is filed to waive this requirement. Requests to waive the stormwater management plan requirements shall be submitted to the city engineer for approval. 
The minimum requirements for stormwater management may be waived in whole or in part upon written request of the applicant, provided that at least one of the following conditions apply or the applicant presents sufficient engineering data and analysis to support their request for a waiver as determined by the local jurisdiction: 
(1)  It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this division. 
(2)  Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater management plan that has been approved by the city engineer and local ordinance (or some other legally enforceable document) that requires the implementation of the plan. 
(3)  Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility. The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the stormwater practice. 
(4)  The city engineer finds that meeting the minimum on-site management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical characteristics of a site. 
(5)  Non-structural practices will be used on the site that reduce: a) the generation of stormwater from the site; b) the size and cost of stormwater storage; and c) the pollutants generated at the site. These non-structural practices shall be explained in detail in the local or state design manual and the amount of credit available for using such practices shall be determined by the city engineer. 
(b)  Conditions of waiver. In instances where one of the conditions above applies, the city engineer may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these stormwater management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a variance, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city engineer that the waiver will not result in the following impacts to downstream waterways: 
(1)  Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures; 
(2)  Degradation of biological functions or habitat; 
(3)  Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation; and 
(4)  Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, and property. 
(c)  Mitigation requirements for waivers. Where compliance with minimum requirements for stormwater management is waived, the applicant will satisfy the minimum requirements by meeting one of the mitigation measures selected by the city engineer. Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. These lands should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat. 
(2)  The creation of a stormwater management facility or other drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public or private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed in accordance with the purposes and standards of this article. 
(3)  Monetary contributions (fee-in-lieu) to fund stormwater management activities such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland delineation studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and macroinvertebrates, stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species studies, hydrologic studies, and monitoring of stormwater management practices, etc.). 
(d)  Fee in lieu of stormwater management practices. Where the city engineer waives all or part of the minimum stormwater management requirements, or where the waiver is based on the provision of adequate stormwater facilities provided downstream of the proposed development, the applicant may be required to pay a fee in an amount as determined by the city engineer. 
When an applicant obtains a waiver of the required stormwater management, the monetary contribution required shall be in accordance with a fee schedule (unless the developer and the city engineer agree on a greater alternate contribution) established by the mayor and council. All of the monetary contributions shall be credited to an appropriate capital improvements program project, and shall be made by the developer prior to the issuance of any development permits. 
(e)  Dedication of land. In lieu of a monetary contribution, an applicant may obtain a waiver of the required stormwater management by entering into an agreement with the city for the granting of an easement or the dedication of land by the applicant, to be used for the construction of an off-site stormwater management facility. The agreement shall be entered into by the applicant and the city prior to the recording of plats or, if no record plat is required, prior to the issuance of the development permits. 
(Ord. No. 28-06, Art. IV(3), 5-15-06) 
Sec. 24-404. - General performance criteria for stormwater management. 
Unless judged by the city engineer to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at all sites: 
(1)  All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified design storms and reduce the generation of stormwater. These practices should seek to utilize previous areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity. 
(2)  All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not discharge untreated stormwater directly into a state water without adequate control of stormwater runoff. Where such discharges are proposed, the impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be assessed using a method acceptable to the city engineer. In no case shall the impact on functional values be any less than allowed by the Army Corp of Engineers (ACE) or the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. 
(3)  Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained to the maximum extent practical, by promoting infiltration through the use of structural and non-structural methods where allowable. 
(4)  For new development, stormwater treatment practices shall be designed to remove pollutants to levels prescribed in the current LDM. It is presumed that a BMP complies with this performance standard if it is: 
a.  Sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume (WQ v ); 
b.  Designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined in the LDM; 
c.  Constructed properly; and 
d.  Maintained regularly. 
(5)  To protect stream channels from degradation, a specific channel protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the current LDM. 
(6)  Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources (i.e., fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming beaches, recharge areas, etc.) may be subject to additional performance criteria, or may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices. 
(7)  Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI) under the provisions of the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) general permit. The stormwater pollution prevention plan requirement applies to both existing and new industrial sites. 
(8)  Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher potential pollutant loadings, known as "hotspots", may require the use of specific structural stormwater treatment practices (STPs) and pollution prevention practices. 
(9)  Prior to design, applicants are encouraged to consult with the city engineer to determine if they are subject to additional stormwater design requirements. 
(10)  The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the LDM shall be used for sizing all stormwater management practices. 
(Ord. No. 28-06, Art. IV(4), 5-15-06) 
Sec. 24-405. - Basic stormwater management design criteria. 
(a)  Minimum control requirements. All stormwater management practices will be designed so that the specific storm frequency storage volumes (e.g., recharge, water quality, channel protection, ten-year, 100-year) as identified in the LDM are met, unless the city engineer grants the applicant a waiver or the applicant is exempt from such requirements. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city engineer reserves the right to impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff. 
(b)  Site design feasibility. Stormwater management practices for a site shall be chosen based on the physical conditions of the site. Applicants shall consult the current LDM for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting a stormwater management practice. 
(c)  Conveyance issues. All stormwater management practices shall be designed to convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in flow velocities. The current LDM shall provide detailed guidance on the requirements for conveyance for each of the approved stormwater management practices. 
(d)  Landscaping plans required. All stormwater management practices that utilize wetlands vegetation as part of the functional treatment process (e.g. constructed wetlands, etc.) must submit a separate landscaping plan detailing both the vegetation to be in the practice and how and who will manage and maintain this vegetation. NOTE: Here, Houston County added". This plan must be prepared by an individual having a professional certification by the Society of Wetlands Scientists and has completed three projects of a similar nature that have been successfully implemented or equivalent qualifications as determined by the Engineering Department." 
(e)  Maintenance agreements. All stormwater treatment practices shall have an enforceable operation and maintenance agreement to ensure the system functions as designed. This agreement will include any and all maintenance easements required to access and inspect the stormwater treatment practices, and to perform routine maintenance as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater treatment practice. In addition, a legally binding covenant specifying the parties responsible for the proper maintenance of all stormwater treatment practices shall be secured prior to issuance of any permits for land disturbance activities. An example of the covenant can be found in the LDM. 
(f)  Non-structural stormwater practices. The use of non-structural stormwater treatment practices is encouraged in order to minimize the reliance on structural practices. Credit in the form of reductions in the amount of stormwater that must be managed can be earned through the use of non-structural practices that reduce the generation of stormwater from the site. These non-structural practices are explained in detail in the current LDM and applicants wishing to obtain credit for use of non-structural practices must ensure that these practices are documented and remain unaltered by subsequent property owners. 
(Ord. No. 28-06, Art. IV(5), 5-15-06) 
Sec. 24-406. - Requirements for stormwater management plan approval. 
(a)  Stormwater management plan required for all developments. No application for development will be approved unless it includes a stormwater management plan detailing in concept how runoff and associated water quality impacts resulting from the development will be controlled or managed. This plan must be certified by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Georgia and/or registered land surveyor licensed in the State of Georgia and must indicate whether stormwater will be managed on-site or off-site and if on-site, the general location and type of practices. 
The stormwater management plan(s) shall be referred for comment to all other interested agencies, and any comments must be addressed in a final stormwater management plan. This final plan must be signed by a licensed professional authorized by state law to certify such plans, who will verify that the design of all stormwater management practices meet the submittal requirements outlined in the submittal checklist found in the current LDM. No development permits shall be issued until a satisfactory final stormwater management plan, or a waiver thereof, shall have undergone a review and been approved by the city engineer after determining that the plan or waiver is consistent with the requirements of this article. 
(b)  Stormwater management plan requirements. A stormwater management plan shall be required with all land disturbance activity (LDA) permit applications and will include sufficient information (e.g., maps, hydrologic calculations, etc.) to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project site, the potential impacts of all proposed development of the site — both present and future — on the water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the measures proposed for managing stormwater generated at the project site. The intent of this planning process is to determine the type of stormwater management measures necessary for the proposed project, and ensure adequate planning for management of stormwater runoff from future development. To accomplish this goal the applicant will prepare a design report which shall include elements sufficient to ensure compliance with this article as outlined in the current LDM. The city engineer reserves the right to extend these requirements to ensure compliance with this article if the requirements in the current LDM prove to be insufficient. However, in these cases, the city engineer must provide a written explanation of the additional elements needed to the applicant. 
(c)  Performance bond/security. The city may, at its discretion, require the submittal of a performance security or bond in order to ensure that the stormwater practices are installed by the permit holder as required by the approved stormwater management plan. The amount of the installation performance security shall be the total estimated construction cost of the stormwater management practices approved under the permit, plus twenty-five (25) percent as agreed to by the applicant and the city. The performance security shall contain forfeiture provisions for failure to complete work specified in the stormwater management plan. 
The installation performance security shall be released in full only upon submission of "as-built plans" and written certification by a licensed professional authorized by state law to certify that the stormwater practice will function in accordance with the approved plan and other applicable provisions of this article. The city engineer will make a final inspection of the stormwater practice to ensure that it is in compliance with the approved plan and the provisions of this article. Provisions for a partial pro-rata release of the performance security based on the completion of various development stages may be done at the discretion of the city engineer. 
(d)  Errors and omissions insurance. The city requires a professional engineer, landscape architect or registered surveyor licensed in the State of Georgia to maintain in full force and effect errors and omissions liability insurance in the amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) per occurrence while practicing in the city. Said certificate of insurance shall be submitted to the engineering department to confirm that such insurance has been procured and is in force. 
(Ord. No. 28-06, Art. IV(6), 5-15-06) 
Sec. 24-407. - Construction inspection. 
(a)  Notice of construction commencement. The applicant must notify the city engineer in advance before the commencement of construction. If any violations are found, the property owner shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions. No added work shall proceed until any violations are corrected and all work previously completed has received approval by the city engineer. 
(b)  As-built plans. All applicants are required to submit actual "as-built" plans for any stormwater management practices located both on-site and off-site after final construction is completed in a format specified in the current LDM. The plan must show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and must be certified by a licensed professional authorized by state law to make such certification. A final inspection by the city engineer is required before the release of any performance securities can occur. 
(c)  Landscaping and stabilization requirements. Any area of land from which the natural vegetative cover has been either partially or wholly cleared or removed by development activities shall be revegetated within ten (10) days from the substantial completion of such clearing and construction. The following criteria shall apply to revegetation efforts: 
(1)  Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial cover crop accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until such time as the cover crop is established over ninety (90) percent of the seeded area. 
(2)  Replanting with native woody and herbaceous vegetation must be accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until the plantings are established and are capable of controlling erosion. 
(3)  Any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of a minimum of seventy-five (75) percent of the cover crop throughout the year immediately following revegetation. Revegetation must be repeated in successive years until the minimum seventy-five (75) percent survival for one year is achieved. 
In addition to the above requirements, a landscaping plan must be submitted with the final design describing the vegetative stabilization and management techniques to be used at a site after construction is completed in accordance with other such requirements in the city's code of ordinances. This plan will explain not only how the site will be stabilized after construction, but who will be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the site and what practices will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative cover is preserved. 
(Ord. No. 28-06, Art. IV(7), 5-15-06) 
Sec. 24-408. - Maintenance and repair of stormwater facilities. 
(a)  Maintenance easement. Prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy or final plat that has a stormwater management facility as part of the project, the applicant or owner of the site must execute a maintenance easement agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the stormwater management facility. The agreement shall provide for access to the facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the city engineer, or his/her contractor or agent, and for regular or special assessments of property owners to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and any other provisions established by this article. 
(b)  Maintenance covenants. Maintenance of all stormwater management facilities shall be ensured through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be approved by the city engineer and recorded into the final plat prior to final approval. As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater management facility. The covenant shall also include plans for periodic inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility between scheduled cleanouts. 
The city, in lieu of a maintenance covenant, may accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater management facility for maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this division and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance. 
(c)  Requirements for maintenance covenants. Stormwater management facilities may be required to undergo annual inspections to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of this division and accomplishment of its purposes. These needs may include: removal of silt, litter and other debris from all catch basins, inlets and drainage pipes; grass cutting and vegetation removal; and necessary replacement of landscape vegetation. Any maintenance needs found must be addressed in a timely manner, as determined by the city engineer, and the inspection and maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater management facility. The requirement for such inspections shall be outlined in the maintenance covenant. 
(d)  Inspection of stormwater facilities. Inspection programs may be established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to: routine inspections; inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as higher than typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants; inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with higher than usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type which are more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of state or federal water or sediment quality standards or the NPDES stormwater permit; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in drainage control facilities; and evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities and other stormwater treatment practices. 
(e)  Right-of-entry for inspection. When any new drainage control facility is installed on private property, or when any new connection is made between private property and a public drainage control system or sanitary sewer, the property owner shall grant to the city engineer the right to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when it has a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this article is occurring or has occurred, and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a violation of this article. 
(f)  Records of installation and maintenance activities. Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management facility shall make records of the installation and of all maintenance and repairs, and shall retain the records for at least three (3) years. These records shall be made available to the city engineer during inspection of the facility and at other reasonable times upon request. 
(g)  Failure to maintain practices. If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the maintenance covenant, the city, after reasonable notice, may correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance needs by performing all necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. In the event that the stormwater management facility becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the city engineer shall notify the party responsible for maintenance of the stormwater management facility in writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the responsible person shall effect maintenance and repair of the facility in an approved manner and within the established deadline. After proper notice, the city may assess the owner(s) of the facility for the cost of repair work and any penalties; and the cost of the work shall be a lien on the property, or prorated against the beneficial users of the property, and may be placed on the tax bill and collected as ordinary taxes by the city. 
(Ord. No. 28-06, Art. IV(8), 5-15-06) 
Sec. 24-409. - Enforcement and penalties. 
(a)  Violations. Any development activity that is commenced or is conducted contrary to this article may be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law. 
(b)  Notice of violation. When the city engineer determines that an activity is not being carried out in accordance with the requirements of this article, the city engineer shall issue a written notice of violation to the owner of the property. 
The notice of violation shall contain: 
(1)  The name and address of the owner or applicant; 
(2)  The address when available or a description of the building, structure or land upon which the violation is occurring; 
(3)  A statement specifying the nature of the violation;

(6)  A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed to the city by filing a written notice of appeal within three (3) days of service of notice of violation. 
Persons receiving a notice of violation may be required to halt all construction activities via a stop work order. 
(c)  Stop work orders. This "stop work order" will be in effect until the city engineer confirms that the development activity is in compliance and the violation has been satisfactorily addressed. Failure to address a notice of violation in a timely manner as determined by the city engineer can result in civil, criminal, or monetary penalties in accordance with the enforcement measures authorized in this division. 
(d)  Civil penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this article shall be subject to a civil penalty of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00). Such person shall be subject to such penalty for each day during which the violation occurs or continues. 
(e)  Restoration of lands. Any violator may be required to restore land to its undisturbed condition. In the event that restoration is not undertaken within a reasonable time after notice, the city may take necessary corrective action, the cost of which shall become a lien upon the property until paid.

DIVISION 4. - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION[12] 

Footnotes: 
--- (12) --- 
Editor's note— At the instruction of the city, Ord. No. 9-12, adopted Mar. 5, 2012, amended Art. X, Div. 4, §§ 24-421—24-450, to read as herein set out. The former Art. X, Div. 4, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 28-06, Art. V, adopted May, 15, 2006; and Ord. No. 55-07, adopted Oct. 15, 2007. 

Sec. 24-421. - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives. 
(a)  Statutory authorization. Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a) have delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and council of the City of Warner Robins do hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(b)  Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the City of Warner Robins, are subject to periodic inundation that results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(c)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this division to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.

b.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than eighteen (18) inches above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade. 
c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Reference subsection (a)(6) above) 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days; 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions); or 
3.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation requirements [in] subsection (b)(3)a. and c. above; or 
(4).  Floodway—Located within areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 24-423(b), are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
b.  Only if subsection (b)(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section. 
(c)  Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 24-423(b), where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A-zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with subsection 24-423(b), then the city engineer shall obtain, review, and reasonable utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this section. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (subsections (2) and (3)) shall apply. 
(2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty (20) feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in more than a one-foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (Note:) Require the lowest floor to be elevated eighteen (18) inches above the estimated base flood elevation in A-zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (a)(4), "Elevated buildings". 
a.  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
The city engineer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(d)  Standards for areas of special flood hazard (zones AE) with established base flood elevations without designated floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 24-423(b), where streams with base flood elevations are provided but no floodways have been designated, (zones AE) the following provisions apply: 
(1)  No encroachments, including fill material, new structures or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
(2)  New construction or substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with subsection (a). 
(e)  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). Areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 24-423(b), may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (a)(4), "Elevated buildings". 
The city engineer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(2)  New construction or the substantial improvement of a non-residential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to the specified FIRM flood level plus eighteen (18) inches, above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsection 24-424(b)(1)c. and (b)(2). 
(3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
(f)  Standards for subdivision.

(4)  For subdivisions and/or developments greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is less, base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision and all other proposed development, including manufactured home parks and subdivisions. Any changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted to FEMA for review as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. Upon completion of the project, the developer is responsible for submitting the "as-build" data to FEMA in order to obtain the final LOMR. 
(g)  Standards for critical facility. 
(1)  Critical facilities shall not be located in the 100-year floodplain or the 500-year floodplain. 
(2)  All ingress and egress from any critical facility must be protected to the 500-year flood elevation. 
(Ord. No. 9-12, Art. V, § 5, 3-5-12) 
Sec. 24-426. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The city council (council) as established by the City of Warner Robins shall hear and decide request or variance from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the city engineer in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of city council may appeal such decision to the Superior Court of Houston County, as provided in O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such request, city council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this article. 
(h)  Conditions for variance: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and; 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighted carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The city engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(5)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

Sec. 24-451. - Findings. 
The mayor and city council make the following findings of fact: 
(1)  Warner Robins is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph III thereof and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services throughout Warner Robins. 
(2)  In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the government of Warner Robins hereby exercises its authority to establish a Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund and establish rates for stormwater management services. 
(3)  In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, Warner Robins is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia and the City Charter of Warner Robins to provide for stormwater collection and disposal. 
(4)  Improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within Warner Robins. 
(5)  A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within Warner Robins and surrounding areas. 
(6)  Warner Robins presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainage-related capital improvement needs. 
(7)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater can adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by the Warner Robins thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system. 
(8)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the further degradation of the water quality in area waterbodies which may result in higher levels of treatment requirements imposed on Warner Robins' wastewater treatment facilities and increased water treatment cost of potable water supplies by Warner Robins. 
(9)  Proper management of stormwater is a key element of having clean water with adequate assimilative capacity for treated wastewater discharges and adequate potable drinking water that are essential to support existing development as well as future development and redevelopment in Warner Robins. 
(10)  The city is required under federal and state regulations [i.e. the city's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II Georgia Notice of Intent (NOI) and stormwater permit effective March 13, 2003] to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and stormwater conveyance system into State of Georgia or United States' waters. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4 and stormwater conveyance system, whether the property is private or public in nature. 
(11)  Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the NPDES Phase II Stormwater Permit, along with other city stormwater program activities, will substantially increase the cost of providing stormwater management services above what is currently being spent for water quality management, drainage system maintenance, flood control and other program activities. 
(12)  The cost of operating and maintaining the Warner Robins stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system. 
(13)  The professional engineering and financing analysis, known as the Stormwater Utility Implementation Report (including amendments) and related documents, dated August 2005 and prepared by the city's consulting stormwater engineer, which report is incorporated herein by express reference, properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy. 
(14)  Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management systems within the city in concert with other water resource management programs. 
(15)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
(16)  The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways as described in the Stormwater Utility Implementation Report. 
(17)  The services and benefits rendered, or resulting from provision of stormwater management services, may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the long term demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management services which render or result in services and benefits to such properties and the owners thereof. 
(18)  A stormwater management program (SWMP) provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services within the city through stormwater user fee charges, user fees and other mechanisms as described in the Stormwater Utility Implementation Report, and the other related documents, that have been prepared for the city by its consultants. 
(19)  A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Such user fee charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council. 
(20)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the city's SWMP, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit, and such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility manager. Reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the property. 
(21)  The area of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge. 
(22)  It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes.

Sec. 24-452. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Act means and refers to the Clean Water Act as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq. ), as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant thereto. 
Attached residential property shall mean improved property containing individually owned, attached dwelling units such as duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, townhouses, or other residential structures not listed herein where one or more family groups commonly and normally reside or could reside. Improved property may be classified as an attached residential property despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports and small storage buildings. Improved property may be classified as an attached residential property despite the presence of a commercial use. Attached residential property shall not include improved property containing: structures used primarily for non-residential purposes, hotels, motels, rental apartments not individually owned, retirement centers, nursing homes and assisted living home. 
Credit means a reduction in the amount of a stormwater user fee charge to the owner of a particular property for the existence and use of privately owned, maintained and operated on-site or off-site stormwater systems or facilities, or continuing provision of services or activities that reduce or mitigate the city's cost of providing stormwater management services for that particular property. 
Customers of the stormwater utility shall include all persons, properties, and entities serviced by and/or benefiting from the services provided by the city's SWMP and the stormwater utility. These services include, but are not necessarily limited to, the stormwater utility's administration, management, maintenance, expansion, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems for the handling of stormwater runoff of private and public properties, and the regulation of the public and private stormwater management systems, controls, facilities, and activities. 
Detached single-family residential property or DSFR means improved property containing one residential structure which is not attached to another dwelling, and which contains one (1) or more bedrooms, with bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one family. A detached single-family residential property may include a "stick-built," industrialized, or other type of home other than manufactured home located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Improved property may be classified as a detached single-family residential property even if there is present incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, storage buildings, guest houses, servants or caretakers quarters, cottages or barns, or the presence of a commercial use within the residence, as long as such use does not result in additional areas of impervious surfaces. Detached single-family residential properties shall not include improved property containing structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes, manufactured homes located within manufactured home parks where the land is owned by someone other than the owners of the manufactured homes, or multiple dwelling unit residential properties. 
Improved property means property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than five hundred (500) square feet of impervious surfaces. 
Dwelling unit shall mean a structure, which contains one (1) or more bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen facility. 
Equivalent runoff unit (ERU) means the statistical median horizontal impervious surface area of a detached single-family residential property within Warner Robins as of the date of adoption of this article. The horizontal impervious surface area includes, but is not limited to, all areas covered by structures, roof extensions, patios, porches, driveways and sidewalks. 
Hydrologic response defines the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface, the parcel's size, the parcel's shape, the parcel's vegetative canopy, the parcel's groundwater, the parcel's antecedent moisture and the parcel's geologic condition. 
Impervious surface means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil in the manner in which it entered the soil, in natural conditions, prior to development. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, buildings or structures, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel and soil surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development. 
Manufactured home property or MH means a single-family property or lot that is occupied by a manufactured home used for residential purposes. 
Non-single-family residential property or NSFR means improved property containing multiple dwelling unit residential properties, condominiums, apartments, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, tennis courts, swimming pools, public and private schools and universities, research facilities and stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, agricultural uses, water and wastewater treatment plants, and any other form of use not otherwise mentioned which is not a detached single-family residential (DSFR), attached residential (AR) property or manufactured home (MH), and which has private parking lots and private drives or roads. 
Public water influence zone means those areas lying downstream of a culvert, or other stormwater management conveyance system. On the downstream side of the conveyance system, the public water influence zone will extend for a length of six (6) times the diameter (or width) of the culvert from which runoff is being discharged (Field Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, Third Edition, pg. 99), and within the horizontal limits set forth in the aforementioned field manual. For example, if a forty-eight-inch diameter culvert is discharging to a private property, the public water influence zone shall extend twenty-four (24) feet (six (6) times forty-eight-inches) from the end of the culvert and for the specified width (i.e. typically the width of the creek). The Warner Robins Stormwater Utility may perform maintenance and/or capital construction activities only within that portion of the public water influence zone which the city has an ownership interest in, or for which a dedicated easement has been granted to, and accepted by the city for such purpose.

(Ord. No. 68-08, § 2, 12-4-06) 
Sec. 24-453. - Stormwater Utility and Enterprise Fund established. 
(a)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility to be known as the Warner Robins Stormwater Utility, which shall be responsible for stormwater management services throughout the incorporated areas of the city, and which shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of the city's stormwater management services. 
(b)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility enterprise fund in the city budgeting and accounting systems for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the Warner Robins SWMP and stormwater utility, including, but not limited to, rates, charges, and fees as may be established by the city council from time to time, and other funds that may be transferred or allocated to the Warner Robins Stormwater Utility. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater utility enterprise fund and shall be used solely for stormwater management services. All expenses and capital investments of the stormwater utility shall be paid from the stormwater utility enterprise fund; provided, however, that other revenues, receipts and resources not accounted for in the stormwater utility enterprise fund may be applied to stormwater management services as deemed appropriate by the city. 
(c)  The city shall place responsibility with the stormwater utility manager for operation, maintenance and regulation of the SWMP and stormwater management services performed, owned and operated or maintained by Warner Robins, and other related assets, including, but not limited to, properties, other than road rights-of-way, upon which such stormwater management systems and facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access and certain equipment used solely for stormwater management. 
(Ord. No. 68-06, § 3, 12-4-06) 
Sec. 24-454. - Scope of responsibility for stormwater management systems and facilities. 
(a)  The city owns or has rights established by written agreements which allow it to operate, maintain, improve and access those stormwater management systems and facilities which are located: 
(1)  Within public road rights-of-way; 
(2)  On private property but within easements granted to, and accepted by, Warner Robins, or are otherwise permitted to be located on such private property by written agreements for rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other permanent provisions for operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management system facilities located thereon; 
(3)  On private property but within the public water influence zone as defined in section 24-452 of this article; 
(4)  On land dedicated to, and accepted by, the city solely for the operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management systems and facilities located thereon; or 
(5)  On public land which is owned by the city and/or land of another governmental entity upon which the city has agreements providing for the operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management systems and facilities located thereon. 
(b)  Operation, maintenance and/or improvement of stormwater management systems and facilities which are located on private or public property not owned by the city, and for which there has been no written agreement granting easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other form of dedication thereof to the city for operation, maintenance, improvement and access of such stormwater management and systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, except as otherwise provided for by the state and federal laws and regulations. 
(c)  It is the express intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and welfare of people and property in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person, or to any specific property within or outside the boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages or equitable remedies upon the city, its elected officials, officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship. 
(d)  If any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity or change upon property not owned by the city pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of the city, or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit, negligent issuance of a permit, negligent plan approval, or negligent maintenance of any permitted stormwater management system or facility not expressly dedicated to and accepted by the city for further maintenance in an action seeking the imposition of money damages or equitable remedies against the city, its commissioners, officers, employees or agents. 
(Ord. No. 68-06, § 4, 12-4-06) 
Sec. 24-455. - Stormwater utility customer classes. 
(a)  There shall be one (1) stormwater utility service area in Warner Robins with specified customer classes to reflect variations in services provided to stormwater utility customers and the respective demand that those customers' properties place on the city SWMP and drainage system.

(1)  Detached single-family residential (DSFR) customers as defined in section 24-452 of this article. 
(2)  Attached residential (AR) customers shall consist of all properties as defined in section 24-452 of this article. 
(3)  Manufactured home (MH) customers shall consist of all properties as defined in section 24-452 of this article. 
(4)  Non-single-family residential (NSFR) customers, as defined in section 24-452 of this article, shall consist of all properties located in Warner Robins that are not classified as DSFR, AR or MH. 
(b)  Documentation pertaining to the Warner Robins Stormwater Utility customer classes shall be kept on file in the office of the stormwater utility manager for public inspection. 
(Ord. No. 68-06, § 5, 12-4-06) 
Sec. 24-456. - Stormwater user fee charges. 
(a)  It shall be the policy of the city that user fee charges for stormwater management services to be provided by the stormwater utility in the designated service areas shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services by individual properties and/or the level of service rendered by, or resulting from, the provision of stormwater management services. Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be structured so as to be uniform within the customer class, and the resultant user fee charges shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services. User fee charge rates shall be in addition to other rates, charges, or fees employed for stormwater management within the incorporated areas of the city, including, but not limited to, plan review and inspection fees, fees for special services, fees in lieu of regulatory requirements, system development charges and special assessments. 
(b)  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater user fee charges shall be provided for on-site stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by public and private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities. 
(Ord. No. 68-06, § 6, 12-4-06) 
Sec. 24-457. - Stormwater user fee charge rates. 
(a)  Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the city council. A schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the city clerk of the City of Warner Robins. In setting or modifying such rates it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair and reasonable, and together with other sources of support available to the Warner Robins Stormwater Utility, are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management services, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the city. 
(1)  The stormwater user fee charge shall be four dollars and twenty-five cents ($4.25) per month per ERU. 
(2)  Detached single-family residential (DSFR) customer class. All DSFR properties shall be charged a flat rate equivalent to one (1) ERU. 
(3)  Attached residential (AR) customer class. All AR properties as defined herein shall be charged the rate applicable to one (1) ERU times the number of dwelling units located on the property (ERU total ) times an adjustment factor (AF). The adjustment factor (AF) has been determined to be 0.72. For each monthly user fee charge billing, the ERU total figure will be multiplied by the adjustment factor (AF) which adjusts the ERU total to equal the median impervious surface of a statistical comparison of AR properties versus DSFR properties in the city. Therefore, each attached residential dwelling unit will be charged a stormwater user fee of 0.72 ERU per dwelling unit per month. 
(4)  Manufactured home (MH) customer class. All MH properties as defined herein shall be charged the rate applicable to one (1) ERU times the number of dwelling units located on the property (ERU total ) times an adjustment factor (AF). The adjustment factor (AF) has been determined to be 0.37. For each monthly user fee charge billing, the ERU total figure will be multiplied by the adjustment factor (AF) which adjusts the ERU total to equal the median impervious surface of a statistical comparison of MH properties versus DSFR properties in the city. Therefore, each attached residential dwelling unit will be charged a stormwater user fee of 0.37 ERU per dwelling unit per month. 
(5)  Non-single-family residential (NSFR) customer class. All NSFR properties as defined herein shall be billed one (1) ERU for every three thousand (3,000) square foot increment, or portion thereof, of impervious surface. In cases where a fractional ERU is calculated, the total ERU for the customer account will be rounded down to the next whole number for billing. Increments of impervious surface less than three thousand (3,000) square feet shall not be billable except in the case of minimum bills (i.e. five hundred (500) to two thousand nine hundred ninety-nine (2,999) square feet of impervious surface), which shall be billed at the rate for one (1) ERU. For customers located within a development with shared common parking or other impervious surface, the amount of shared common impervious surface associated with the developed land shall be apportioned to the individual customer by a percentage of the impervious surface attributable to the customer as determined by the total common shared impervious surface times the percentage of the customer's square feet of leased, or owned, interior or exterior space to the total square feet within the development of interior, or exterior, space available for occupancy. Fractional ERUs for NSFR properties will be rounded to two decimal places to establish the actual number of ERUs for billing. 
(b)  The customers of the stormwater utility shall be billed for the stormwater user fee charges. The stormwater user fee charge may be billed on a common statement and collected along with other city public utility charges. The customer may be the occupant, owner or user who is billed by the city for public services, i.e. water, sewer, natural gas and/or sanitation. If the improved property does not receive any other city public utility services, or is not being charged for public utility services due to vacancy, or non-use, at the time of stormwater user fee billing, then the owner of the property, shall be billed for stormwater management services by the city. Regardless of whether or not the developed land has an occupant or user, the owner is ultimately responsible for payment of the stormwater user fee charges. 
(Ord. No. 68-06, § 7, 12-4-06; Ord. No. 24-08, § 2, 6-16-08; Ord. No. 31-10, 6-21-10) 
Sec. 24-458. - Stormwater user fee charge exemptions. 
Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no public or private property located in the incorporated area of Warner Robins shall be exempt from the stormwater user fee charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities. 
Exemptions to the stormwater user fee charges are as follows: 
(1)  Parcels which contain five hundred (500) square feet, or less, of impervious surfaces shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges.

All other state, federal, and county properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties. 
(4)  Warner Robins (city owned) public streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction services undertaken by the city via the general fund. However, other improved property used for city purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
(e)  Any property whereby one hundred (100) percent of the stormwater runoff is contained or infiltrated on the property and no stormwater runoff is discharged, via overland flow, into the city owned storm drainage system. 
(Ord. No. 68-06, § 8, 12-4-06) 
Sec. 24-459. - Stormwater user fee charge credits.

The amount of credit, or reduction of the stormwater user fee charge, shall be in accordance with the criteria contained in the credit technical manual. 
(2)  Any credit allowed against the stormwater user fee charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the credit technical manual and/or upon continuing provision of the controls, systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. The stormwater utility manager may revoke a credit at any time for noncompliance with applicable standards and criteria as established in the credit technical manual or this article. 
(3)  In order to obtain a credit, the property owner must make application to the city on forms provided by the stormwater utility manager for such purpose, and in accordance with the procedures outlined in the credit technical manual. 
(4)  Property owners may apply for any credits and/or adjustments in accordance with the credit manual. 
(5)  The application for any credit or adjustment must be in writing and must include the information necessary to establish eligibility for the credit or adjustment, and be in the format established by the stormwater utility manager. Incomplete applications will not be accepted for consideration and processing. 
(b)  When an application for a credit is deemed complete by the stormwater utility manager, he shall have thirty (30) days from the date the complete application is accepted to either grant the credit in whole, grant the credit in part, or deny the credit. Credits applied for by the property owner and granted in whole or in part, shall apply to all stormwater user fee charges in accordance with the terms defined in the credit technical manual. 
(Ord. No. 68-08, § 9, 12-4-06) 
Sec. 24-460. - Enforcement methods and inspections. 
(a)  All property owners of improved property within the incorporated areas of Warner Robins shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater runoff in a safe manner consistent with all applicable city development regulations, ordinances, and state and federal laws. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a violation of this article and be subject to citation and prosecution in the Warner Robins Municipal Court. Each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate offense, subject to the penalties set forth in section 1-11 of the Warner Robins Code of Ordinances. 
(b)  Alternately, in the event a public nuisance is deemed to exist by the stormwater utility manager, the city may elect to sue in the Warner Robins Municipal Court to abate such nuisance. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the Warner Robins Municipal Court, the city may enter upon the property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of filing of such abatement action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the Warner Robins Municipal Court. 
(c)  The city shall have the right for its designated officers and employees to enter upon public and private property during reasonable hours, and after reasonable notice to the owner thereof, in order to assure compliance with the provisions of this article, and state and federal law. Such inspections shall generally be limited to the following purposes: 
(1)  Inspecting or conducting engineering analyses on existing stormwater management systems and facilities located on-site; or 
(2)  Determining that stormwater management systems and facilities need to be constructed. 
(Ord. No. 68-06, § 10, 12-4-06) 
Sec. 24-461. - Stormwater user fee charge billing, delinquencies, collections, adjustments. 
Failure to receive a stormwater utility bill is not justification for non-payment. The property owner, as identified from public land records of Houston County, shall be obligated to pay the appropriate stormwater user fee charge for that property. 
(1)  Billing. 
a.  Stormwater user fee charges shall begin to accrue as established by the mayor and council, and shall be billed prospectively. A bill for stormwater user fee charges may be sent through the United States Postal Service or by alternative means, notifying the owner of the property being billed of the amount of the stormwater user fee charge, less credits, the date the payment is due and the date when payment is past due. 
b.  The stormwater user fee charge will be billed and collected as deemed most effective and efficient by the city council. 
c.  Frequency of the billing of stormwater user fee charges shall be specified by the city council. 
d.  Failure to receive a bill shall not be justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each improved property subject to stormwater user fee charges shall be obligated to pay stormwater user fee charges and any interest on delinquent stormwater user fee charge payments. 
e.  If a property is unbilled, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of improved property, the Warner Robins Stormwater Utility may back bill for a period of up to one (1) year, but shall not be entitled to any interest or any delinquency charges during the back billed period. 
(2)  Delinquencies and collection. 
a.  Unpaid stormwater service fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by Georgia law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment. Unless reduced to a judgment and a writ of fieri facias issued, the unpaid user fee charge shall not constitute a direct lien against the owner and/or the property. 
b.  A late charge shall be assessed against the customer for the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility user fee charge that becomes delinquent in accordance with applicable state law. In addition, the city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, against the property owner. 
(3)  Adjustments. 
a.  The stormwater utility manager shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge. 
1.  If a customer believes their stormwater user fee is incorrect, the customer may seek an adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge allocated to a property at any time by submitting the request in writing to the stormwater utility manager and setting forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought. 
2.  Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide supplemental information to the stormwater utility manager, including, but not limited to, a survey certified by a registered land surveyor or a professional engineer. Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city aerial photography. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the stormwater utility manager, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the adjustment request. 
3.  Once a completed adjustment request and all required information are received by the stormwater utility manager, the stormwater utility manager shall have thirty (30) calendar days within which to render a written decision. Concurrent payment of any charges allocated to the property is not required as a condition precedent to this request for review. 
4.  In considering an adjustment request, the stormwater utility manager shall consider whether the calculation of the stormwater utility user fee charge for the property is correct. 
5.  The stormwater utility manager's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing. 
6.  If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be applied as a credit on the applicant's next stormwater bill. 
(Ord. No. 68-06, § 11, 12-4-06) 
Sec. 24-462. - Appeals, hearings. 
(a)  Appeals. An appeal to the mayor and city council may be taken by any property owner or customer aggrieved by any decision of the stormwater utility manager. The appeal shall be taken within thirty (30) days of the decision of the stormwater utility manager by filing with the mayor and city council a notice of appeal in writing specifying the grounds thereof. Upon the filing of the notice of appeal, the stormwater utility manager shall forthwith transmit to the mayor and city council all documentation constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was taken. 
(b)  Hearing. The mayor and city council shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal and give written notice to the appellant at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing date. The notice shall indicate the place, date and time of the hearing. The mayor and city council shall affirm, reverse, affirm in part, or reverse in part the decision of the stormwater utility manager after hearing the evidence. If the decision of the stormwater utility manager is reversed in whole or in part, resulting in a refund or credit due to the property owner, then such refund or credit shall be calculated retroactive to the date of the initial appeal. 
(c)  The decision of the mayor and city council shall be final, and there shall be no further administrative action. Any person aggrieved or dissatisfied with the decision of the mayor and city council may appeal that decision to the Superior Court of Houston County by Writ of Certiorari.

(Ord. No. 19-82, § 1, 6-7-82) 
Section 63. - Conformance to the master comprehensive plan. 
63.1 All proposed subdivisions shall conform to the Master Comprehensive Plan, zoning and subdivision regulations, and development policies in effect at the time of submission to the planning commission. 
63.2 All highways, streets, and other features of the Master Comprehensive Plan shall be platted by the subdivider in the location and to the dimension indicated on the Comprehensive Plan.

Plans for such developments shall be submitted to and approved by the planning commission whether or not such plat is to be recorded and no building permits shall be issued until such approval has been given. 
65.2 No plans for a planned unit development plan shall be reviewed or approved by the commission before the developer's site has been zoned to allow such use. 
Section 66. - Modifications to subdivision principles and standards of design. 
66.1 Modifications of the provisions set forth in these rules and regulations may be recommended by the planning commission. The city council shall be the granting authority for such modifications. These modifications may be granted in specific cases when, after a finding of fact, it is determined that undue hardship will result from strict compliance; provided any such determination shall be based fundamentally on the fact that unusual topographical or other exceptional conditions require such modifications. Furthermore, the granting of such modifications by the city council will not adversely affect the general public, create any public liability, or nullify the intent of these regulations; provided further that any such modifications shall not be in instances where the hardship is a result of the actions of the subdivider. 
66.2 Application for any modifications must be filed in writing with necessary supporting documents with the planning commission by the subdivider and shall explain in detail the reasons and facts supporting the application.

ARTICLE V. - APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS 
Except as hereinafter provided: 

Section 51. - Use. 
No building or land shall hereafter be used or occupied and no building or part hereof shall be erected, moved or altered unless in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is or is to be located. Said conformity shall be evidenced by the issuance of a valid building permit, certificate of occupancy, or certificate of zoning exception or variance. No more than one (1) principal use per lot shall be permitted except as provided herein. 
(Ord. No. 32-14, 11-3-14) 
Section 52. - Height requirements. 
No building or structure shall hereafter be erected, moved or altered which does not comply with the following height requirements. 
52.1.  Height obstructions. The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the construction of objects which, because of their height, illumination or reflectivity, electrical emissions, and/or air emissions, represent an obstruction or safety hazard to air traffic operating in and out of Robins Air Force Base (RAFB). 
52.1.1.  Definitions. The following definitions shall be used to interpret the requirements of section 52.1. 
52.1.1.1.  Approach-departure surface. This surface is symmetrical about the RAFB runway centerline extended, begins as an inclined plane (glide angle) two hundred (200) feet beyond each end of the primary surface to the centerline elevation of the runway end, and extends for fifty thousand (50,000) feet. The slope of the approach-departure clearance surface is 50:1 (one (1) foot change in elevation for each fifty (50) feet in distance from the starting point) along the extended runway (glide angle) centerline until it reaches an elevation of five hundred (500) feet above the established airfield elevation, at which point it becomes a horizontal surface. It then continues horizontally at this elevation to a point at fifty thousand (50,000) feet from the start of the glide angle. The width of this surface at the runway end is two thousand (2,000) feet. It then flares uniformly, with an end width of sixteen thousand (16,000) feet at a distance fifty thousand (50,000) feet from both starting points. 
52.1.1.2.  Conical surface. This inclined surface extends outward and upward from the outer periphery of the inner horizontal surface for a horizontal distance of seven thousand (7,000) feet. The slope of the conical surface is 20:1 (one (1) foot change in elevation for each twenty (20) feet in distance from the starting point), with an inner elevation of one hundred fifty (150) feet above the established airfield elevation and an outer elevation of five hundred (500) feet above the established airfield elevation. 
52.1.1.3.  Clear zone surface. This surface defines the limits of the obstruction clearance requirements in the vicinity contiguous to the end of the primary surface. The length and width (for a single runway) of a clear zone surface is three thousand (3,000) feet by three thousand (3,000) feet. 
52.1.1.4.  Established airfield elevation. The altitude, measured in feet above mean sea level (MSL), of the Robins Air Force Base main runway surface. This elevation is hereby declared to be two hundred ninety-five (295) feet MSL. 
52.1.1.5.  Height. The true highest altitude of a structure or natural feature (including trees, protruding rocks, or natural ground surface) as measured in feet above mean sea level. 
52.1.1.6.  Inner horizontal surface. This surface is a plane, oval in shape, that extends seven thousand five hundred (7,500) feet from the RAFB airfield runway centerline at a height of one hundred fifty (150) feet above the established airfield elevation. 
52.1.1.7.  Obstruction. Any structure or natural feature (including trees, protruding rocks, or natural ground surface) which exceeds the height limitation defined by the primary surface, clear zone surface, approach-departure clearance surfaces, inner horizontal surface, conical surface, outer horizontal surface, or transitional surfaces established for Robins Air Force Base. 
52.1.1.8.  Outer horizontal surface. This surface is a horizontal plane that begins at the outer edge of the conical surface and extends for thirty thousand (30,000) feet at a height of five hundred (500) feet above the established airfield elevation. 
52.1.1.9.  Primary surface. This surface defines the limits of the obstruction clearance requirements in the immediate vicinity of the landing area. The primary surface comprises surfaces of the runway, runway shoulders, and lateral safety zones and extends two hundred (200) feet beyond the runway end. The width of the primary surface for the RAFB runway is two thousand (2,000) feet, or one thousand (1,000) feet on each side of the runway centerline. 
52.1.1.10.  Structure. Any stationary or mobile object constructed or installed by man, including, without limitation, buildings, towers, cranes, smoke stacks, earth formations, and overhead transmission lines. 
52.1.1.11.  Transitional surfaces. These surfaces connect the primary surfaces, clear zone surfaces, and approach-departure clearance surfaces to the outer horizontal surface, conical surface, and other horizontal or transitional surfaces. The slope of the transitional surface is 7:1 (one (1) foot in elevation for each seven (7) feet in distance from the starting point) outward and upward at right angles to the runway centerline extended. 
52.1.2.  Application. These regulations shall apply to all lands within the City of Warner Robins that are overlaid by the primary surface, clear zone surface, approach-departure clearance surfaces, inner horizontal surface, conical surface, outer horizontal surface, or transitional surfaces established for Robins Air Force Base. These boundaries of these surfaces are shown on the Official Zoning Map of Warner Robins, Georgia. All development activity within these areas shall comply with the performance standards in section 52.1.3. below in addition of the requirements of the underlying zoning district. Where conflicting standards and requirements exist, the more stringent standards and requirements shall apply. 
52.1.3.  Performance standards. All development within the areas governed by these height requirements shall comply with the following performance standards. 
52.1.3.1.  Height limitation. No structure shall be built which, by virtue of its finished height, would constitute an obstruction within the meaning of these regulations. Where the development or redevelopment of land within the areas affected by these regulations will involve substantial grading and/or site preparation, the planning and zoning commission or board of zoning appeals may require the applicant to remove any existing obstructions (either natural or manmade) on the site as a condition of development plan approval. 
52.1.3.2.  Use restrictions. No use may be made of land or water located within the RAFB approach-departure surfaces that would: 
52.1.3.2.1. Create or result in electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between RAFB and aircraft operating within the affected areas; 
52.1.3.2.2. Produce or reflect light in a sufficient intensity or manner that would make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and other light sources, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the base airport, or otherwise impair visibility in the vicinity of the base. All proposed light sources that could conflict with this requirement (except structure lighting required under FAR Part 77) shall be properly shielded or directed away from a pilot's field of visions; 
52.1.3.2.3. Emit smoke or particulate matter which, in sufficient quantities or concentrations, would impair pilot visibility in the vicinity of the base or clog aircraft engines; or 
52.1.3.2.4. Attract large flocks of birds, which would constitute a hazard to air navigation in the vicinity of the base. No solid waste disposal facility or landfill may be sited within areas affected by these regulations. 
52.1.4.  Review procedures. The standard zoning compliance process for the City of Warner Robins shall apply to the areas affected by these regulations. However, any applicant proposing to construct a structure that is: 
(1)  Located within the RAFB outer horizontal surface or the approach-departure horizontal surface and would exceed two hundred (200) feet in height as measured from its tallest point to the finished ground level; or 
(2)  Located within the RAFB primary surface, clear zone surface, inner horizontal surface, conical surface, approach-departure glide angle surface, or any transitional surface and would exceed one hundred (100) feet in height as measured from its tallest point to the finished ground level; shall comply with the following review procedures, in addition to the normal zoning compliance process. 
52.1.4.1.  RAFB civil engineer's office review. The City of Warner Robins shall provide a copy of an application for zoning compliance within the affected areas, including the development plan and a copy of the FAR Part 77 review transmittal letter and application as required, to the staff of the Middle Georgia Regional Commission (MGRC), within five (5) days of submittal by applicant. The staff of the MGRC will forward such information to the RAFB civil engineer's office and any other affected parties for review. The MGRC will review all comments and provide written recommendations to the City of Warner Robins zoning officer within ten (10) days of receipt. The planning and zoning commission may condition any approval upon RAFB recommendations. 
52.1.4.2.  FAA review. The applicant shall submit a copy of the application for FAA review under FAR Part 77, if applicable. A copy of the FAR Part 77 review transmittal letter and application shall be submitted to the planning and zoning commission to document compliance with this requirement. The planning and zoning commission may condition any approval upon FAA approval under FAA Part 77 review. 
52.1.5.  Submission requirements. An applicant shall submit a preliminary plan in accordance with the applicable requirements of these regulations for any development application that satisfies the special review requirements in section 52.1.4 above. The City of Warner Robins zoning officer may require the applicant to submit any or all of the items specified below, if the additional information is necessary to ensure compliance with the performance standards in section 52.1.3 above. 
52.1.5.1.  Imaginary surface boundaries. The applicant may be required to delineate on the preliminary plan the boundaries of any primary surface, clear zone surface, approach-departure clearance surfaces, inner horizontal surface, conical surface, outer horizontal surface, or transitional surfaces, if the location of the aforementioned surface boundaries with respect to the proposed development site or proposed structure locations is in question. All maps prepared to show the location of these boundaries shall be drawn to a scale designated by the City of Warner Robins zoning officer. 
52.1.5.2.  Location of structures. The applicant may be required to delineate the placement of all existing and proposed buildings and structures, including any existing or proposed tree stands. 
52.1.5.3.  Specification of uses. The applicant may be required to specify the proposed uses to occur within each structure or activity area on the development site. 
52.1.5.4.  Surface elevation benchmarks. The applicant may be required to show the surface elevation of all structures (above mean sea level) and the maximum height in feet of any structure. For residential subdivisions, the zoning officer may require the applicant to show surface elevations for the property in five-foot contours with sufficient benchmarks to verify contour elevations. 
52.1.5.5.  Narrative description. The applicant may be required to prepare a narrative describing the location of the site, its total acreage, existing character and use; the concept of the proposed development or use, such as proposed residential density, and the relation of the proposed development plan to the comprehensive plan. 
52.1.6.  Variances. Any applicant wishing to erect a new structure, increase the height of an existing structure, permit the growth of any tree, or commit the property to a use that is not in compliance with the regulations prescribed in these regulations may apply to the planning and zoning commission for a variance. The application for variance must be submitted in the form and manner specified in these regulations, and it must be accompanied by a written determination from the Federal Aviation Administration and the RAFB civil engineer's office stating that the proposed structure will not be located within a normal aircraft flight track, that the requested height variance will not be excessive, and that all appropriate measures will be taken by the applicant to prevent any negative impacts on safe navigation within the protected air space surrounding RAFB. Such variances shall be issued only where it is duly determined that a literal application or enforcement of these regulations will result in unnecessary hardship, and the relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit and intent of these regulations. In addition, the planning and zoning commission may solicit the testimony of a qualified professional, at the expense of the applicant, to evaluate the proposed development plans and issue any professional findings or opinions that would assist the board in reaching a decision regarding the variance request. The selection of a qualified professional shall be done by the planning and zoning commission. 
52.2.  Exemptions. No building or structure shall hereafter be erected, moved or altered so as to exceed the height limitations that may be specified herein for the district in which it is located, except for the following buildings and structures: 
52.2.1. Churches, schools, hospitals, sanitariums and other public and semi-public and public utility buildings. There shall be no restriction on the height on [of] such buildings, provided the front, side, and rear yards required in the district in which such building is to be located shall be increased an additional one (1) foot for each one (1) foot that the building exceeds the maximum height permitted in the district. 
52.2.2. Barns, silos, grain elevators, or other farm structures; belfries, cupolas and domes; monuments; water towers; transmission towers, windmills, chimneys; smokestacks; flagpoles; ratio towers, masts, and aerials.

52.2.4. None of these exceptions to height limits shall be construed to allow structures located within the primary surface, clear zone surface, approach-departure clearance surfaces, inner horizontal surface, conical surface, outer horizontal surface, or transitional surfaces established for Robins Air Force Base to exceed the height restrictions imposed by section 52.1 above. 
52.2.5. None of these exceptions to height limits shall apply to signs or outdoor advertising signs or poster panels which shall be subject to all height limitations of the district in which they are located. 
(Ord. No. 32-14, 11-3-14) 
Section 53. - Lots. 
No lot, even though it may consist of one (1) or more adjacent lots of record, shall be reduced in size so that lot width or depth; front, side, or rear yard; inner or outer court; lot area per family; or other requirements of these regulations are not maintained. No building shall hereafter be constructed on a lot which does not have a minimum frontage of thirty (30) feet on a street. This section shall not apply when a portion of the lot in question is acquired for public purpose. 
(Ord. No. 32-14, 11-3-14)

ARTICLE VI. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Section 61. - Nonconformities. 
Within the district established by these regulations or amendments that may later be adopted, there exists lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before these regulations were passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of these regulations or future amendments. It is the intent of these regulations to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of these regulations that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
61.1.  Incompatibility of nonconforming uses. Nonconforming uses are declared by these regulations to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts in which such use is located. A nonconforming use of structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of these regulations either by the attachment on a building or premises, of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises; or by the addition of other uses of the property which would be generally prohibited in the district in which such use is located; or additions to any existing structure. 
61.2.  Avoidance of undue hardship. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of these regulations and upon which actual building construction has begun. 
61.3.  Single nonconforming lots of record. A single lot of record which does not meet the requirements for area or width, or both that are applicable in the district existing at the effective date of adoption or amendments of these regulations may be used or sold for the erection of those buildings and accessory buildings necessary to carry out the permitted uses in that district provided: 
61.3.1. Yard dimensions and lot coverage requirements other than those applying to area or width or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located; 
61.3.2. Variance for yard dimensions and lot coverage requirements shall be obtained only through action of the planning and zoning commission as provided for in section 114; 
61.3.3. Location requirements of accessory buildings and uses are met as provided for in section 93.1; 
61.3.4. Parking space requirements for all districts as provided for in section 62.2; 
61.3.5. Such lot must not have continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership; 
61.3.6. In residential districts, buildings shall be limited to single-family detached dwellings. 
61.4.  Nonconforming lots of record in combination. If two (2) or more lots or a combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of these regulations and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the land involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of these regulations and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by these regulations nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with a width or area below the requirements stated in these regulations. 
61.5.  Nonconforming uses of land. Where, at the time of adoption of these regulations, lawful uses of land exist which would not be permitted by the requirements imposed by these regulations the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided: 
61.5.1. No such nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of these regulations; 
61.5.2. No such nonconforming uses shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the effective date of adoption or amendment of these regulations; 
61.5.3. If any such nonconforming uses of land are discontinued for a period of more than one (1) year, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the requirements specified by these regulations for the district in which such land is located; and 
61.5.4. No additional structures not conforming to the requirements of these regulations shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
61.6.  Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of these regulations that could not be built under the terms of these regulations by reason of restriction on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, bulk, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
61.6.1. No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity; further, that any such enlargement or alteration shall not in itself be nonconforming; 
61.6.2. Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed by any means to the extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its current replacement value, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of these regulations; 
61.6.3. Should such structure be voluntarily moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the requirements for the district in which located after it is moved. 
61.7.  Nonconforming uses of structures or structures and premises in combination. If a lawful use involving individual structures, or of a structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the regulations that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of these regulations, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful; subject to the following provisions: 
61.7.1. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by these regulations in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, voluntarily moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located; 
61.7.2. Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed; 
61.7.3. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of these regulations, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building; 
61.7.4. When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination is discontinued or abandoned for more than one (1) year, the structure or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located; 
61.7.5. Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure to the extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its current replacement value, shall not eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. 
61.8.  Repairs and maintenance. On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs including remodeling, or repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
(Ord. No. 32-14, 11-3-14) 
Section 62. - Off-street automobile parking.

Section 70. - Storage of motor vehicle tires. 
(1)  Finding. The mayor and council find that the open, uncovered storage of tires or the covered storage of tires from which water has not been drained, each provide breeding grounds for mosquitoes and other insects and provide watering sources for rodents and similar animals resulting in a nuisance to neighboring individuals and detriment to neighboring properties and consequent health and other hazards. This body further finds that it is necessary that the storage of such tires be regulated and that storage be prohibited unless in accordance with the terms of this ordinance. 
(2)  Definition. For the purposes of this chapter, the word "tire" is defined as a hollow ring, made of rubber or other material, which is designed for placement on the wheel or rim of a motor vehicle to facilitate its operation. 
(3)  Outside or uncovered storage of tires when prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, corporation, organization or association of any kind in charge or control of any property within the area of the City of Warner Robins, whether as owner, tenant, occupant, lessee, agent or otherwise, to store or permit the storage of tires in the open or in an uncovered condition. 
(4)  Covered storage of tires prohibited; exception. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, corporation, organization or association of any kind in charge or control of any property within the area of the City of Warner Robins, whether as owner, tenant, occupant, lessee, or agent or otherwise, to store or permit the storage of tires in a covered area unless the same is protected from the elements and prior to storage, all water has been drained therefrom. 
(5)  New storage. Any person, firm or corporation desiring to store more than twenty-five (25) used tires on property in the City of Warner Robins shall, before undertaking such storage, make application to the code enforcement office for a permit to affect such storage and which shall meet the following requirements: 
(a)  All tires must be stored dry to prevent mosquito breeding. 
(b)  The applicant shall demonstrate to the code enforcement officers how the intended storage will thereafter prevent the accumulation of water in the stored tires. 
(c)  The application must be accompanied by payment of a fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00). 
(d)  Upon receipt of the application and payment of the fee, the code enforcement office will cause the site to be inspected and will examine the proposed method of storage. 
(6)  When permit issued. If the code enforcement officers determine that the tires to be stored are free of accumulations of water and the method of storage will be such as to thereafter prevent accumulations of water in the tires, the office shall issue a permit which shall be valid for the site of storage so long as the method of storage remains effective to prevent the accumulation of water and newly added stock is stored dry. If the storage methods and site fail to meet the foregoing standards, the office may, after notice and hearing, revoke the permit. 
(7)  Application to existing storage site of tires. The owners or occupants of existing storage sites of tires shall, immediately upon the passage of this ordinance, make application as provided in subsection (6) above, and shall comply with the standards therein set forth; provided, however, that the owners or occupants of existing sites shall be allowed a period of thirty (30) days in which to bring existing storage into compliance with the provisions of this ordinance. 
(8)  Code enforcement to carry out terms of chapter. The code enforcement office is hereby designated as the agency to receive and approve or disapprove applications under the provisions of this chapter and to enforce its terms. Each code enforcement officer is hereby appointed as agent for the City of Warner Robins for the service of citations for violations hereof. 
(9)  When storage unlawful. It shall be unlawful for any person, or corporation to begin to store or continue the storage of used or discarded tires or to permit the storage of used or discarded tires unless the owner or occupant is the holder of a currently valid permit issued by code enforcement. 
(10)  Zoning ordinance unaffected. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize any outside storage when it is prohibited by the zoning ordinance of the city.

Section 74. - Special districts. 
74.1.  Planned development districts. 
74.1.1.  Intent of districts. The purpose of this section is to provide greater design flexibility in the development of land consistent with the comprehensive development plan. The use of planned development zoning classifications should be encouraged when they promote a harmonious variety of uses, provide for an economy of shared services and facilities, are compatible with surrounding areas, and foster the creation of attraction, healthful, efficient, and stable environments for living, shopping or working. 
The planned development district regulations and procedures may apply to the development of presently open or vacant lands and may apply to parcels of relatively small size as well as large-scale development, depending upon the nature of the proposed use and improvements and their relationship with other surrounding uses and the overall characteristics of the area in which they are located. 
Planned development district regulations are intended to encourage innovations in land development techniques so that the changing demands of the community may be met with greater flexibility and variety in type, design, and layout of sites and buildings and by the conversion and more efficient use of open spaces and other amenities generally enhancing the quality of life. 
Planned development projects should also encourage a more efficient use of land which reflects changes in the technology and economics of land development so that resulting economies may accrue to the benefit of the community at large. 
Planned development residential (PDR), planned development commercial (PDC), planned development industrial (PDI) and planned development extraordinary (PDE) districts differ from each other in the nature of the uses permitted. 
74.1.2.  Eligibility requirements for planned development districts. In determining the eligibility of an area of land or development for designation as a planned development district, the commission must find that one (1) or more of the following conditions exists:

74.3.4.  Required plans. No permit shall be issued for the construction of any building or structure including railroads, streets, bridges, and utility lines or for any use within the Flood Hazard District until the plans for such construction or use have been submitted to the planning and zoning commission and approval is given in writing for such construction or use. In its review of plans submitted, the planning and zoning commission shall be guided by the following standards, keeping in mind that the purpose of this district is to prevent encroachment into the floodway which will unduly increase flood heights and endanger life and property. 
(1)  Any structure or the filling of land permitted shall be of a type not appreciably damaged by flood waters, provided no structures for human habitation shall be permitted. 
(2)  Any use permitted shall be in harmony with and not detrimental to the uses permitted in the adjoining district. 
(3)  Any permitted structures or the filling of land shall be designed, constructed, and placed on the lot so as to offer the minimum obstruction to and effect upon the flow of water. 
(4)  No filling of land within the floodway shall be allowed except where necessary for the construction of railroads, streets, bridges, and utility lines. 
(5)  Any structure, equipment, or material permitted shall be firmly anchored to prevent it from floating away and thus damaging other structures and threatening to restrict bridge openings and other restricted sections of the stream. 
(6)  Where in the opinion of the said board topographic data, engineering, and other studies are needed to determine the effects of flooding on a proposed structure or fill and/or the effect of the structure or fill on the flow of water, the said board may require the applicant to submit such data or other studies prepared by competent engineers and other technical people. 
(7)  The granting of approval of any structure or uses shall not constitute a representation, guarantee, or warranty of any kind or nature by the city or the planning and zoning commission or by any officer or employee thereof, or the practicality or safety of any structure or use proposed and shall create no liability upon or cause action against such public body, officer, or employee for any damage that may result pursuant thereto. 
74.3.5.  Warning of disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as bridge openings restricted by debris. These regulations do not imply that areas outside the flood district boundaries or land uses permitted within such district will be free from flooding or flood damages. These regulations shall not create liability on the part of the government or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
74.4.  BE Base Environs Overlay District. 
74.4.1.  Title and purpose. The Base Environs Overlay District (BE) is hereby created with the following purposes:

74.4.9.2.  Location of structures. The applicant may be required to delineate the placement of all existing and proposed buildings and structures, including any existing or proposed tree stands. 
74.4.9.3.  Specification of uses. The applicant may be required to specify the proposed uses to occur within each structure or activity area on the development site. 
74.4.9.4.  Narrative description. The applicant may be required to prepare a narrative describing the location of the site, its total acreage, existing character and use; the concept of the proposed development or use, such as proposed residential density, and the relation of the proposed development plan to the comprehensive plan. 
74.4.10.  Development review criteria. The preliminary plan described in section 74.4.9 shall be reviewed and evaluated using, at a minimum, the following criteria: 
74.4.10.1.  Proposed uses. All elements of the proposed development shall be consistent with Table 74.4-A, Land Use Compatibility Standards. 
74.4.10.2.  Siting. Buildings and structures should be located the greatest distance from the noise source, taking maximum advantage of existing topographical features to minimize noise impact, and within zoning district requirements, such as required setbacks. Buildings and structures should be oriented to minimize exposure to the noise source and building openings, such as windows, should be located away from the noise source. 
74.4.10.3.  Passive outdoor recreation space. The amount of passive outdoor recreational space where individuals would be subject to noticeable or severe levels of noise should be minimized. Landscaping materials should be used to deflect noise. 
74.4.11.  Variances. Any applicant wishing to erect a new structure or construct a development that is not in compliance with the regulations prescribed in these regulations may apply to the planning and zoning commission for a variance. Variances for prohibited land uses and/or applicable sound insulation requirements are not permitted. The application for variance must be submitted in the form and manner specified in these regulations, and it must be accompanied by a written determination from the Federal Aviation Administration stating that appropriate mitigation measures will be taken by the applicant to prevent any negative impact on safe navigation within the protected air space surrounding RAFB. The planning and zoning commission will send a copy of the variance application to the RAFB civil engineering office. These comments will be considered by the planning and zoning commission, along with all other public comments submitted on the variance application. Such variances shall be issued only where it is duly determined that a literal application or enforcement of these regulations will result in unnecessary hardship, and the relief granted will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit and intent of these regulations. In addition, the planning and zoning commission may solicit the testimony of a qualified professional, at the expense of the applicant, to evaluate the proposed development plans and issue any professional findings or opinions that would assist the planning and zoning commission in reaching a decision regarding the variance request. The selection of a qualified professional shall be done by the planning and zoning commission.

NLR — (Noise Level Reduction) — NLR (outdoor to indoor) to be achieved through incorporation of noise attenuation measures into the design and construction of the structures. 
A, B, or C — Land use and related structures generally compatible; measures to achieve NLR for A (DNL/DNEL 65—69), B (DNL/CDEL 70-74), C (DNL/CNEL 75-79), need to be incorporated into the design and construction of structures. The NLR is less than 60 DNL. 
A * , B * , and C * — Land use generally compatible with NLR. However, measures to achieve an overall noise level reduction do not necessarily solve noise difficulties and additional evaluation is warranted. See appropriate footnotes. 
*  — The designation of these uses as "compatible" in this zone reflects individual federal agencies' and program considerations of general cost and feasibility factors, as well as past community experiences and program objectives. Localities, when evaluating the application of these guidelines to specific situations, may have different concerns or goals to consider. 
SUPERSCRIPT NOTES 
1.  Suggested maximum density of one (1) to two (2) dwelling units per acre, possibly increased under a planned development district (PDR, PDC, PDI, PDE) where maximum lot coverage is less than twenty (20) percent. 
2.  Within each land use category, uses exist where further deliberating by local authorities may be needed due to the variation of densities in people and structures. Shopping malls and shopping centers are considered incompatible use in any accident potential zone (CZ, APZ I, or APZ II). 
3.  The placing of structures, buildings, or aboveground utility lines in the clear zone is subject to severe restrictions. In a majority of the clear zones, these items are prohibited. See AFI 32-7060 (formerly AFR 19-9) and AFJM 32-8008 (formerly AFM 86-14) for specific guidance. 
4.  No passenger terminals and no major aboveground transmission lines in APZ I. 
5.  Factors to be considered: labor intensity, structural coverage, explosive characteristics, and air pollution. 
6.  Low-intensity office uses only. Meeting places, auditoriums, etc. are not recommended. 
7.  Excludes chapels. 
8.  Facilities must be low intensity. 
9.  Clubhouse not recommended. 
10.  Areas for gatherings of people are not recommended. 
11.  A.  Although local conditions may require residential use, it is discouraged in DNL/CDEL 65-69 dB and strongly discouraged in DNL/CNEL 70-74 dB. The absence of viable alternative development options should be determined, and an evaluation indicating a demonstrated community need for residential use would not be met if development were prohibited in these zones should be conducted prior to approvals. 
B.  Where the community determines the residential uses must be allowed, measures to achieve outdoor to indoor noise level reduction (NLR) for DNL/CNDL 65-69 dB and DNL/CNDL 70-74 dB should be incorporated into building codes and considered in individual approvals. 
C.  NLR criteria will not eliminate outdoor noise problems. However, building location and site planning, and design and use of berms and barriers can help mitigate outdoor exposure, particularly from near ground level sources. Measures that reduce outdoor noise should be used whenever practical in preference to measures which only protect interior spaces. 
12.  Measures to achieve the same NLR as required for facilities in DNL/CNEL 65-69 dB range must be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas or where the normal noise level is low. 
13.  Measures to achieve the same NLR as required for facilities in DNL/CNEL 70-74 dB range must be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas or where the normal noise level is low. 
14.  Measures to achieve the same NLR as required for facilities in DNL/CNEL 75-79 dB range must be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas or where the normal noise level is low. 
15.  If noise sensitive, use indicated NLR; if not, the use is compatible. 
16.  No buildings. 
17.  Land use compatible provided special sound reinforcement systems are installed. 
18.  Residential buildings require the same NLR as required for facilities in DNL/CNEL 65-69 dB range. 
19.  Residential building require the same NLR as required for facilities in DNL/CNEL 70-74 dB range. 
20.  Residential buildings are not permitted. 
21.  Land use is not recommended. If the community decides the use is necessary, hearing protection devices should be worn by personnel. 
22.  Naturally occurring water features (e.g. rivers, lakes, streams, wetlands) are pre-existing, nonconforming land uses. Naturally occurring water features that attract waterfowl present a potential BASH. Actions to expand naturally occurring water features or construction of new water features should not be encouraged. If construction of new features is necessary for stormwater retention, such features should be designed so that they do not attract water fowl. 
74.5. Zone of transition. Where a boundary line of a commercial or industrial district abuts a residential district, the planning and zoning commission, after a review of an application and public hearing thereon, may permit within a distance of one hundred fifty (150) feet to the boundary and within the residential district a private or public parking lot used for the parking of passenger vehicles related to the commercial or industrial establishment abutting such parking area provided that the off-street parking requirements in section 62 are adhered to.

114.1.11. At the public hearing conducted by the planning and zoning commission, the chairman shall open the hearing at the time and place specified in the hearing notice. The chair shall announce the rules of the hearing before proceeding to address the proposed amendments listed on the agenda. 
The chair shall announce each proposed amendment. The chair shall then call for a show of hands of those present wishing to speak in support of the proposed amendment. The chair shall recognize each such person in turn and ask him or her to rise, state his or her name and address, and present his or her statement. The chair shall then call for a show of hands of those present wishing to speak in opposition to the proposed amendment. The chair shall recognize each such person in turn and ask him or her to rise, state his or her name and address, and present his or her statement. The duration of arguments, both for and against the proposed amendment, shall be limited by the chair, and no statement, either in support of or in opposition to the amendment, shall be allowed to exceed the time limit so imposed.

114.1.12. All speakers shall speak only from the podium, shall address only the merits of the pending application and shall address remarks only to the planning and zoning commission. Each speaker shall refrain from personal attacks on any other speaker, any discussion irrelevant to the pending application, or any other inappropriate behavior. No debate or argument between speakers or with commission members will be allowed. Speakers shall not repeat previous comments, as repetition deprives other speakers of valuable time to provide new information.

Speakers should provide supporting documentation prior to the date of the hearing. Speakers shall sign the speaker sign-in sheet prior to the hearing. 
114.1.13. The planning and zoning commission and the mayor and council will consider the following factors in determining zoning decisions: 
(1)  The location, present use and zoning classification of subject property, and its suitability and economic viability for use as currently zoned; 
(2)  The proposed use and zoning classification of the subject property; 
(3)  Whether the proposal is consistent with the comprehensive plan; 
(4)  The existing land use pattern and the official future land use plan as adopted in the surrounding area or neighborhood; 
(5)  The possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to other, nearby districts (spot zoning); 
(6)  The increase in population density; 
(7)  The possible overloading of the capacity of public facilities including, but not limited to, schools, streets and highways, sanitary sewer system, water system, fire and police protection, and drainage structures; 
(8)  Impact on the physical, cultural, and social environment; 
(9)  The effect on adjacent properties; 
(10)  Whether there are substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accordance with existing zoning and/or the length of time the property has remained vacant at its present zoning as considered in the context of land development in the area; 
(11)  The aesthetic effect of existing and future use of the property as it relates to the overall environment of the surrounding area; 
(12)  The relative public benefits to be derived as compared to any potential hardship imposed upon the individual property owner(s); and 
(13)  Reasonable conditions, as set forth on the site plan as submitted by the petitioner, as recommended by the planning and zoning commission, or as imposed by the mayor and council at the time the petition is granted; 
(14)  Any other factors relevant to the balancing interest in promoting health, safety, morality or general welfare against the unrestricted use of property including, but not limited to, impact upon police and fire protection capabilities and the protection of flood zones and natural areas. 
The annexation/zoning petition report and recommendation in its present or future form will be the instrument used to provide decision-making information to mayor and council and planning and zoning commission members. 
114.1.14. The mayor and council shall take action on the said proposed amendment within forty-five (45) days after the date of the public hearing held by the planning and zoning commission. The mayor and council shall review the reports prepared by the planning and zoning staff and the planning and zoning commission. Mayor and council may approve or deny the application, approve with modifications or conditions, approve an alternate district or land use category to address the request or defer the decision to a specified meeting date. An action by mayor and council to defer the application shall include a statement of the date and time of the next meeting at which the application will be considered. Such statement shall constitute public notice and no further notice, as outlined in sections 114.1.8—9, is required. The mayor and council shall have the authority to resubmit the proposed amendment for reconsideration by the commission. In the event of a resubmission, the commission shall issue its final recommendation to the mayor and council within thirty (30) days. 
114.1.15. The permitted order in which amendments may be made to the text of the zoning ordinance, land use plan and the official zoning map, respectively, is as follows: 
(1)  The text of the zoning ordinance may be amended without prior or subsequent amendment to the land use plan or the official zoning map. 
(2)  The official zoning map may be amended without an amendment to the land use plan if the proposed amendment would permit a use that is permitted by the land use plan. 
(3)  If a proposed amendment to the official zoning map would permit a use that is not authorized within the land use category of the subject property as shown on the land use plan, then the applicant must obtain an appropriate amendment to the land use plan before applying for the rezoning. The applicant may apply for an appropriate amendment to the land use plan and at the same time apply for zoning map amendment. 
(4)  The land use plan may be amended regardless of the zoning districts that apply to the subject property. 
(5)  Where an application to amend the land use plan and an application to amend the official zoning map each affect the same property and are scheduled to be heard at the same hearing, the application to amend the land use plan shall be heard first, and action authorized by this ordinance taken before the application to amend the official zoning map is heard and action taken with respect thereto. 
114.1.16.  Disclosure of campaign contributions and/or gifts (O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-3). When any applicant for any zoning action, or any supporter or opponent of any zoning action who has contacted the city to express an opinion or who wishes to speak at a public hearing or submit written opinion, has made within two (2) years immediately preceding the filing of that application campaign contributions totaling two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) or more to an official of the City of Warner Robins or to a member of the Warner Robins Planning and Zoning Commission it shall be the duty of said person to file a disclosure report with the city. In the case of the applicant, filing shall be within ten (10) days after the application is made, and in the case of a supporter or opponent, filing shall be at least five (5) days before the first public hearing. Such disclosure report shall include the name and official position of the official to whom the campaign contribution and/or gift was made and the dollar amount, date, and description of each campaign contribution and/or gift made during the two (2) years immediately preceding the fling of the application. 
114.1.17.  Conflict of interest (O.C.G.A. § 36-67A-2). Any city official who has property interest in real property affected by a zoning action which the city will consider or has a financial interest in any business entity which as a property interest in any real property affected by a zoning action which the city will consider, or has a member of the family having any such interest, shall immediately disclose the nature and extent of such interest, in writing, to the council. Such city official shall disqualify himself from attending, participating in or voting on the zoning action. Disclosures made in accordance with this section shall be public record and available for public inspection during normal business hours. Terms used here are defined below. 
(1)  Business interest: Any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, firm, enterprise, franchise, association, or trust.

(5)  Property interest: The direct ownership of real property, including any percentage of ownership. 
114.1.18.  Procedure relative to ex parte contact with mayor and council. The planning and zoning commission is not subject hereto. To maintain transparency and to avoid an appearance of impropriety in the decision-making process, there shall be no unsolicited substantive ex parte (individual) communication with the mayor or council members by an applicant or his/her representative(s) or by supporters of or opposition to the rezoning, unless the mayor or councilperson agrees to such. Unsolicited e-mails, letters, and faxes to the mayor and council as a whole, copied to the zoning enforcement officer are permissible. They will be made a part of the record. The applicant and his/her representative(s) and supports and opponents are to limit their unsolicited verbal contacts with city officials and employees to the zoning enforcement officer and to the city attorney if the proposed contact is from legal counsel. Mayor and council members will accept verbal presentations in the advertised public hearing and meetings, and via express solicitation or agreement in other instances. If an individual mayor or council member shall direct that person to the zoning enforcement officer, and city attorney and advise the person of upcoming public hearing(s), and disclose such to the mayor and council at the public hearing. 
114.1.19. Any petition for a zoning amendment may be withdrawn prior to action thereon by the mayor and council at the discretion of the person, firm, or corporation initiating such request. Written notice of the withdrawal shall be submitted to the zoning enforcement officer. 
114.1.20. An application to alter conditions of a rezoning shall be submitted and processed in accordance with all provisions applicable to map amendments through the planning and zoning staff, the planning and zoning commission for a public hearing, and to the mayor and council for final approval. 
114.1.21. If a decision for the rezoning of said property is defeated by the mayor and council, then the same property may not be considered for rezoning until the expiration of at least six (6) months immediately following the vote of the mayor and council denying such. A text and/or map amendment may be initiated by the city at any time. 
114.1.22. If a site development plan or preliminary plat has not been submitted to the zoning enforcement officer within twelve (12) months of the date of approval of the rezoning application, then the planning and zoning commission may review each case to determine if there are circumstances clearly justifying such delays. If justifying circumstances do not exist, the planning and zoning commission may recommend to the mayor and council that the zoning map be amended to change the land to its prior zoning classification. 
114.2.  Special exceptions (including home occupation) or variances. The zoning enforcement officer shall submit to the planning and zoning commission each application for special exception. Following each submission, the planning and zoning commission may authorize the zoning enforcement officer to issue such special exception. However, at request of the zoning enforcement officer or when required by the planning and zoning commission, the following procedures for issuance of a special exception shall be followed: After examination, review, and a public hearing thereon, the planning and zoning commission may grant special exceptions to the terms of these regulations upon which said commission is required to pass under these regulations; and in addition, grant minor variances and variances from the terms of these regulations where it will not be contrary to the public interest. 
114.2.1. An application must be submitted in writing to the zoning enforcement officer and must be accompanied with site plans, sketches, or any other such information which may be required for review as set forth in section 114.2.3 and section 114.2.9.

114.2.3. Each application for a special exception must be submitted to the zoning enforcement officer at least forty-five (45) days before any hearing by the planning and zoning commission. Unless waived by the zoning enforcement officer, each application shall include all the following information about the subject property: 
(1)  Name and address of the applicant, and name and address of the owner or operator of the proposed structure or use, if different from the applicant; 
(2)  Nature of proposed use, including without limitation, type of activity proposed, manner of operation, number of occupants and/or employees, hours of operation, number of vehicle trips, water and sewer use and similar matters; 
(3)  Vicinity map, location of the proposed use or structure, and its relationship to exiting adjacent uses or structures, and use of adjacent property; 
(4)  Area, dimensions and details of the proposed structure(s) or use(s), including without limitation, existing and proposed parking, landscaped areas, height and setbacks of any proposed buildings, and location and number of proposed parking/loading spaces and access ways; 
(5)  Identification and location of all existing and proposed utilities; and 
(6)  Any other pertinent information that the zoning enforcement officer, planning and zoning commission or council may require, including without limitation, the application contents required by a pre-application conference. 
114.2.4. A special exception shall be approved only when it is determined based on the evidence presented at the public hearing that all of the following conditions have been met: 
(1)  The proposed use will not be detrimental to adjacent properties or the general neighborhood, the proposed use will not significantly adversely affect public health, safety, morality and welfare, and the proposed use as designed will minimize adverse effect to the surrounding neighborhood. 
(2)  Applicable standards in article VIII have been met. 
(3)  The proposed use is consistent with the comprehensive plan, and the conditional use is compatible with the community development pattern. 
(4)  A rezoning to allow the requested use as permitted use would not be appropriate. 
(5)  The proposed use will not be injurious to the natural environment or the other property in the immediate vicinity, or unconstitutionally diminish property values within the surrounding neighborhood. 
(6)  Off-street parking and loading, and access thereto will be adequate. 
(7)  Public facilities and utilities are capable of adequately serving the proposed use, and the use would not lead to a major negative change in existing levels of public service, or fiscal stability. 
(8)  The use will not be an extension of a use which will cause a damaging volume of (a) agricultural, (b) commercial, (c) industrial, or (d) higher density residential use into a stable neighborhood of well-maintained single-family homes, nor likely lead to decreasing surrounding property values, neighborhood deterioration, spreading of blight or additional requests of similar nature which would expand the problem. 
(9)  The use would not significantly increase congestion, nose or traffic hazards. 
(10)  Granting this request would not have a "domino effect," in that it becomes the opening wedge for further rapid growth, urbanization or other land-use change beyond what is indicated in the comprehensive plan. 
114.2.5. The application shall be sent to the planning and zoning commission for review, public hearing and an approval/denial thereof. The planning and zoning commission shall have thirty (30) days in which to make a decision. 
114.2.5.1. Whenever a proposed special exception involves an application for home occupation, a day care center, group home or a personal care home, the planning and zoning commission will make a recommendation to mayor and council. The mayor and council shall take action on the said proposed amendment within forty-five (45) days after the date of the public hearing held by the planning and zoning commission. The mayor and council shall review the reports prepared by the planning and zoning staff and the planning and zoning commission. Mayor and council may approve or deny the application, approve with modifications or conditions, approve an alternate district or land use category to address the request or defer the decision to a specified meeting date. An action by mayor and council to defer the application shall include a statement of the date and time of the next meeting at which the application will be considered. Such statement shall constitute public notice and no further notice, as outlined in sections 114.1.8—9, is required. The mayor and council shall have the authority to resubmit the proposed amendment for reconsideration by the commission. In the event of a resubmission, the commission shall issue its final recommendation to the mayor and council within thirty (30) days.

The signatures are to show that these potentially affected property owners have received notice of the special exception application and the upcoming public hearing. When, in the opinion of the zoning enforcement officer, the proposed use would directly affect the integrity of the existing neighborhood by reason of increased traffic or the possible overloading of other public facilities, then the zoning enforcement officer is authorized to require the signatures and addresses of additional area property owners as deemed necessary to adequately inform the neighborhood of the application. 
114.2.7. Whenever a proposed special exception involves an application for home occupation, a day care center, group home, or a personal care home, or when, in the opinion of the zoning enforcement officer, the proposed use would directly affect the integrity of the neighborhood, a sign containing information as to the proposed request shall be posted in a conspicuous location on the property at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the public hearing. Such sign shall indicate that a proposal for a special exception has been submitted to the planning and zoning commission and interested parties may make inquiries for details of the type of use sought. More than one (1) sign may be posted if, in the opinion of the zoning enforcement officer, one (1) sign would not give adequate notice. The cost of each such sign shall be paid by the applicant in accordance with the schedule of fees set forth by mayor and council. 
114.2.8. Whenever a proposed special exception involves an application for a home occupation and the applicant is not the owner of the property then said application shall be accompanied by the written permission of the owner. 
114.2.9. Use variances are prohibited. No variance may be granted that would permit a use not permitted by right or as a special exception in a district. 
114.2.10. Each application for a variance must be submitted to the zoning enforcement officer at least forty-five (45) days before any hearing by the planning and zoning commission. Each application shall include all the following information about the subject property: 
(1)  Name and address of the applicant; 
(2)  Location of the structure and/or use of the structure for which the variance is sought, as shown on a plat by a licensed surveyor; 
(3)  Relationship of the structure and/or use to existing structures and uses on adjacent lots; 
(4)  Specific sections of this ordinance which would cause hardship, see section 112.1.4. 
(5)  Characteristics of the property related to its size, shape or topography that prevent compliance with this ordinance; 
(6)  The particular hardship that would result from strict application of this ordinance, see section 112.1.4; 
(7)  For any application within an overlay district (i.e. Corridor Overlay, Historic District, etc.) a certificate of appropriateness or a letter of support from a design review board for the district; and 
(8)  Any other pertinent information that the zoning enforcement officer, planning and zoning commission or council may require, including without limitation the application contents required by a pre-application conference. 
114.2.11. Minor variance provides a simplified procedure for city review and decision on variance requests that propose only a minor modification of applicable zoning code standards. The zoning enforcement officer has the authority to review and grant a minor variance, with or without conditions, or may defer action and refer the application to the planning and zoning commission. 
(1)  A public hearing shall not be required for a decision on a minor variance, unless the review authority determines that the specifics of the application justify the holding of a public hearing. 
(2)  An application for a minor variance shall be considered by the zoning enforcement officer governing only the development standards identified in following table. 

 
114.2.12. The granting of any variance or minor variance will only occur upon a finding by the zoning enforcement officer or planning and zoning commission that the request meets the conditions outlined in section 112.1.4. 
114.2.13. The granting of a prior variance shall not set a precedent for the granting of a further variance, and each application shall be considered only on its individual merits. 
114.2.14. A variance shall not be granted if the review authority finds that the condition of the specific piece of property for which a variance is sought, is so general or recurrent in the area as to make practicable the formulation and adoption of a general regulation (e.g. a zoning ordinance amendment) to address and provide for the prevailing condition. 
114.2.15. Variances shall lapse one (1) year from the date of the grant of the variance by the zoning enforcement officer unless: 
(1)  A zoning or building permit is in effect, the land is being used as contemplated in the variance, or regular progress toward completion of the use or structures contemplated in the variance has taken place in accordance with plan for which the variance was granted; or 
(2)  A longer period of validity is established by the zoning enforcement officer or planning and zoning commission; or 
(3)  The variance is for future installation or replacement of utilities at the time such installation becomes necessary. 
114.2.16. Any application for special exceptions or variances may be withdrawn prior to action by the planning and zoning commission at the discretion of the applicant upon written notice to the zoning enforcement officer. 
114.2.17. An applicant shall not initiate action for a special exception or variance involving the same parcel of land more often than once every twelve (12) months. 
114.3.  Appeals from the zoning enforcement officer. The planning and zoning commission may, from time to time, hear appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by the zoning enforcement officer or other administrative officials in the enforcement of these regulations.

Section 123. - Purposes. 
This ordinance is designed and intended to balance the interests of the residents of the City of Warner Robins, telecommunications providers, and telecommunications customers in the siting of telecommunications facilities within the City of Warner Robins so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neighborhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the City of Warner Robins as a proactive city in the availability of personal wireless telecommunications service.

D.  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or antennae failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennae; 
E.  Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to minimize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city; 
F.  Maximize and encourage use of alternative telecommunication tower structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; and 
G.  Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications facilities in areas which are not zoned for residential use.

Section 127. - Preferred and disfavored location sites. 
A.  Preferred location sites. 
1.  Co-location sites: Any existing telecommunications towers currently being used for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site provided, however, that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this ordinance, and co-location sites shall not become an "antenna farm" or otherwise be deemed by the building official or the governing authority to be visually obtrusive. 
2.  Publicly-used structures: Publicly-used structures are preferred locations throughout the city because they appear in virtually all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and due to their institutional or infrastructure uses are generally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facilities. Therefore, telecommunications facilities should be less noticeable when placed on publicly-used structures than when placed on commercial or residential structures. Publicly-used structures include, but are not limited to, facilities such as police or fire stations, libraries, community centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, elevated roadways, bridges, flag poles, schools, hospitals, clock or bell towers, light poles and churches. 
3.  Industrial and commercial structures: Wholly industrial and commercial structures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, or service stations shall be preferred locations particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roofline can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunications facility. 
4.  Mixed use buildings in high density districts: Mixed use buildings (housing above commercial or other non-residential space) are also preferred location sites. 
B.  Disfavored location sites: Any single-family residential structure or site or multi-family duplex shall be a disfavored site for the location of telecommunications facilities. 
Section 128. - Requirements for telecommunications facilities. 
A.  General requirements for all telecommunications facilities: The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities governed by this ordinance. 
1.  Building codes and safety standards: To ensure the structural integrity of telecommunications facilities, the owner of a telecommunications facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilities, as amended from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall conduct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every year to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be conducted by a qualified, independent engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The results of such inspection shall be provided to the building official. 
2.  Regulatory compliance. 
a.  All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the telecommunications facilities governed by this ordinance shall bring such telecommunications facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations. 
b.  Owners of telecommunications facilities shall provide documentation showing that each telecommunications facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state requirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every twelve (12) months. 
3.  Security: All telecommunications facilities shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility. 
4.  Lighting: No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless required by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction or unless necessary for air traffic safety. If lighting is required or necessary, the building official may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 
5.  Advertising: No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. However, a whip antenna may be allowed on any legally permitted permanent billboard or outdoor advertising sign as long as the other requirements of this ordinance are met. 
6.  Visual impact. 
a.  Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the existing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 
b.  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennae shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other background. 
c.  Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a building to help in camouflaging. 
d.  Reserved. 
e.  Telecommunications facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or by any state or federal law or agency. 
f.  Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications facilities must be concealed from public view or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or placed underground. Equipment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding backdrop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained. 
7.  Landscaping. 
a.  Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the telecommunications facility from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property. 
b.  Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that lost. 
c.  The building official may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security purposes, for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping requirement may be modified or waived by the building official. 
8.  Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the collector street. 
9.  Principal, accessory and joint uses. 
a.  Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunications facility. 
b.  Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. 
10.  Lot size and setbacks. 
a.  The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications facilities provided, however, that the building official may reduce the standard setback requirements of this section if the goals of this ordinance would be better served thereby. 
i.  Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to the height of the tower from any off-site residential structure. 
ii.  Towers, guy wires and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
iii.  Telecommunications facilities must be setback from any property line a sufficient distance to protect adjoining property from the potential impact of telecommunications facility failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analysis required in article VII. 
b.  For antennae attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ratio [example: Ten-foot high antenna and supporting structure requires ten-foot setback from edge of roof] shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact. 
B.  Additional requirements for towers: 
1.  Site location and development shall preserve the pre-existing character of the surrounding buildings and land uses and the zone district as much as possible. Personal wireless telecommunication towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical. 
2.  Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be minimized, unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area. 
3.  At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
4.  Towers shall not be located any closer than fifteen hundred (1,500) feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or visually preferable. 
5.  When a tower is adjacent to a residential use, it must be set back from the nearest residential lot line a distance at least equal to its total height. 
6.  In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard or side yard in a residential district. 
7.  Towers shall not be sited where they will negatively affect historic or scenic view corridors as designated by the governing body or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter. 
8.  Towers shall be enclosed by decay-resistant security fencing not less than six (6) feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device or other similar protective device designed to prevent tower access. 
9.  Placement of more than one (1) tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower. Structures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one (1) fails. 
Section 129. - Application procedures. 
A.  General application requirements for all building and special use permits. Application for a building permit or special use permit for any telecommunications facility shall be made to the building official by the person, company or organization that will own and operate the telecommunications facility.

[APPENDIX A.] - GUIDELINES FOR DRIVEWAY ACCESS FROM CONTIGUOUS PROPERTY ONTO STATE HIGHWAYS 
(Applies Also to the Urban Arterial and Collector Routes Described/Enumerated in the Year 2005 Warner Robins Transportation Plan) 
In order to protect the safety, lives, and property of the general public who travel upon the state highways of Georgia, to maintain the capacity and operating efficiency of these state highways, and to provide reasonable access to these state highways from those contiguous properties for which access control is not vested in the department, the following guidelines and requirements on the permitting of driveway access are established. 
I.  COMMERCIAL PROPERTY DRIVEWAYS: 
A.  Single business enterprise on a single interior lot: 
1.  Movements confined primarily to on-site employees totaling no more than 40; one 2-way drive. 
2.  Movements consisting primarily of in and out customer activities where no more than 50 parking spaces are on the site or sites with less than 300" of frontage; one 2-way drive or two 1-way drives. 
3.  Fast food operations, bank with drive-through service, medical offices and other facilities with more than 50 on-site parking spaces and a minimum of 300" of frontage; two 2-way drives. 
4.  Automobile Service stations and Gas Station Minimarts which include gas and oil sales and which have a minimum frontage of 150"; two 2-way drives. 
B.  Single businesses on corner lot: 
1.  One 2-way driveway on mainline and one 2-way driveway on the cross road, totaling two 2-way driveways. Driveways are to be located as far as practical from the intersection. Two 1-way driveways may be substituted for one 2-way drive. 
C.  Multiple businesses on commercial tracts: 
1.  Up to 300 linear feet of frontage; one 2-way drive on two 1-way drives. 
2.  Frontages between 300 and 1,000 linear feet; two 2-way drives. 
3.  Frontages from 1,000 linear feet to 2,000 linear feet; three 2-way drives. 
4.  Frontages from 2,000 linear feet to 3,000 linear feet; three 2-way driveways or two 1-way driveways and 1 multi-lane driveway. 
5.  Frontages of over 3,000 linear feet; driveways as determined on a case-by-case basis. 
D.  Acceleration/deceleration lane requirements: Commercial driveways, except those permitted under Item A1, will normally include appropriate acceleration/deceleration lanes. Such lanes shall be constructed by the developer at no cost to the department. The right-of-way for such lanes shall be dedicated to the department by the developer. The pavement sections for acceleration/deceleration lanes shall match that of the mainline. Acceleration/deceleration lanes may be required under Item A1 if they are considered necessary. 
E.  Left turn lanes at commercial driveways for mainline sections without a divided median: The department may require the construction of left turn lanes at commercial driveways for roadways of two-, four-, or six-lane sections and no divided median. This requirement will be based upon analyses of the capacity constraints imposed upon the roadway by left turns out of through traffic lanes giving consideration to current and 20-year projected traffic volumes. 
F.  Access conveyance: Once the number and configuration of driveways has been established, the developer of commercial property will be requested to deed access control rights along his frontage to the department. For this purpose, commercial property includes residential subdivisions discussed under Item II.D. 
G.  Right-of-way conveyance. Developers of commercial property and residential property, as discussed under Item II.D, will be requested to deed right-of-way for future widening of the mainline highway where such is included in the department's construction work program. 
II.  RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS: 
A.  In no event will the state highway be used as a subdivision street with individual lot driveways. 
B.  For definition of subdivision and the provisions and requirements for review of subdivision plats by the department and the responsibilities of local Planning and Zoning commissions and individuals to submit subdivision plats to the department for review and comment, refer to Georgia Code Sections 32-6-150, 32-6-151, 32-6-152, 32-6-153 and 32-6-154. 
C.  Those not requiring review by the department: Driveway permits shall be issued by the District. This authority may be delegated to the area engineer. 
D.  Those requiring review by the department: The District, with guidance from the state transportation traffic and safety engineer, shall review and comment upon the subdivision plat. Comments shall address access to the state highway. Possible solutions shall consider one, two, or three connections (depending upon frontage) to an interior road system upon which the residential lots front, a frontage road parallel and adjacent to the state highway upon which the lots will front which will also have connections to the state highway system, or in extreme cases a pairing of two lots per driveway. This latter circumstance is not desirable and should be a last resort settlement limited to frontage less than 1000 feet. 
Where a small number of large frontage lots are involved, individual driveways may be allowed. 
E.  Subdivisions of property to accommodate the residential needs of family members of the owner of the tract shall be handled as private residences. 
III. These guidelines address only the number of connections to be allowed to the state highway system. Our current permit requirements with respect to engineering are unchanged.
