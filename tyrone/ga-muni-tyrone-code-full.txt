PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Tyrone, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1984 Code, as supplemented through February 7, 2002 (except that titles 1—4 were the 1984 Code as found on the town's webpage), and ordinances subsequently adopted by the town council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1984 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments

The value of both the property belonging to the town and that to be acquired through the exchange shall be determined by appraisals, and the value so determined shall be approved by the town council. 
(c)  The council may quitclaim any rights it may have in property not needed for public purposes upon report by the mayor and adoption of a resolution, both finding that the property is not needed for public or other purposes and that the interest of the city has no readily ascertainable monetary value. 
(d)  Whenever in opening, extending, or widening any street, avenue, alley, or public place of the town, a small parcel or tract of land is cut off or separated by such work from a larger tract or boundary of land owned by the town, the council may authorize the mayor to execute and deliver in the name of the town a deed conveying said cut-off or separated parcel or tract of land to an abutting or adjoining property owner or owners in exchange for rights-of-way of said street, avenue, alley, or public place or in settlement of any alleged damages sustained by said abutting or adjoining property owner. All deeds and conveyances heretofore and hereafter so executed and delivered shall convey all title and interest the town has in such property, notwithstanding the fact that no public sale after advertisement was or is hereafter made. Notwithstanding any provisions contained in this subsection to the contrary, the town shall comply with any disposition of property requirements imposed by title 36 of the O.C.G.A. and those requirements otherwise imposed by this Charter.

Sec. 7. - Same; signatures; seal. 
All such bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the authority and attested by the secretary and treasurer of the authority and the official seal of the authority shall be affixed thereto; and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the facsimile signatures of the chairman and secretary and treasurer of the authority. Any coupon may bear the facsimile signatures of such persons and any bond may be signed, sealed and attested on behalf of the authority by such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be duly authorized or hold the proper office, although at the date of such bonds such persons may not have been so authorized or shall not have held such office. In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any bonds or whose facsimile signature shall appear on any coupon shall cease to be such officer before delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. 
Sec. 8. - Same; negotiability; exemption from taxation.

Sec. 12. - Same; conditions precedent to issuance.

Sec. 13. - Credit not pledged. 
Revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to constitute a debt of the Town of Tyrone nor a pledge of the faith and credit of said town, but such bonds shall be payable solely from the fund hereinafter provided for and the issuance of such revenue bonds shall not directly, indirectly or contingently obligate the said town to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever therefor or to make any appropriation for their payment; and all such bonds shall contain recitals on their face covering substantially the foregoing provisions of this section. 
Sec. 14. - Trust indenture as security. 
In the discretion of the authority, any issue of such revenue bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state.

Either the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property, the construction of the project, the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the project, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all monies, including the proceeds derived from the sale of property of the authority, both real and personal, and may also provide that any project shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers or architects employed or designated by the authority, and may also contain provisions concerning the conditions, if any, upon which additional revenue bonds may be issued. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation and repair of the project affected by such indenture. 
Sec. 15. - To whom proceeds of bonds shall be paid. 
The authority shall, in the resolution providing for the issuance of revenue bonds or in the trust indenture, provide for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to any officer or person who, or any agency, bank or trust company which, shall act as trustee of such funds and shall hold and apply the same to the purposes hereof, subject to such regulations as this Act and such resolution or trust indenture may provide. 
Sec. 16. - Sinking fund.

(1)  The interest upon such revenue bonds as such interest shall fall due; 
(2)  The principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due; 
(3)  Any premium upon bonds acquired by redemption, payment or otherwise; 
(4)  The necessary charges of the paying agent or agents for paying principal and interest; and 
(5)  Any investment fees or charges. 
The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds or in the trust indenture; but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be maintained as a trust account for the benefit of all revenue bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, any surplus monies in the sinking fund may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds and any such bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not be reissued, printed and delivered. 
Sec. 17. - Remedies of bondholders. 
Any holder of revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this Act or any of the coupons appertaining thereto and the trustee under the trust indenture, if any, except to the extent the rights herein given may be restricted by resolution passed before the issuance of the bonds or by the trust indenture, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the State of Georgia or granted hereunder or under such resolution or trust indenture and may enforce and compel performance of all duties required by this Act or by such resolution or trust indenture to be performed by the authority or any officer thereof, including the fixing, charging and collecting of revenues, fees, tolls and other charges for the use of the facilities and services furnished.

Sec. 20. - Validation.

The bonds, when validated, and the judgment of validation shall be final and conclusive with respect to such bonds and the security for the payment thereof and interest thereon and against the authority issuing the same, the state and any municipality, county, authority, political subdivision or instrumentality, if a party to the validation proceedings, contracting with the said Town of Tyrone Public Facilities Authority. 
Sec. 21. - Interest of bondholders protected. 
While any of the bonds issued by the authority remain outstanding, the powers, duties or existence of said authority or of its officers, employees or agents shall not be diminished or impaired in any manner that will affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds; and no other entity, department, agency or authority will be created which will compete with the authority to such an extent as to affect adversely the interest and rights of the holders of such bonds nor will the state itself so compete with the authority.

Sec. 12-20. - Description. 
An illicit discharge is defined as any discharge to a municipal or county separate storm sewer system (stormwater drainage system) that is not composed entirely of stormwater runoff (except for discharges allowed under an NPDES permit or nonpolluting flows). These non-stormwater discharges occur due to illegal dumping or illegal connections to the stormwater drainage system. This article provides the town with the authority to deal with illicit discharges and establishes enforcement actions for those persons or entities found to be in noncompliance or that refuse to allow access to their facilities. 
(Ord. No. 480, § 1, 12-1-2005) 
Sec. 12-21. - Findings. 
(a)  It is hereby determined that: 
(1)  Discharges to the town separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters. 
(2)  These nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the town separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. 
(3)  These nonstormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume nonstormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. 
(4)  The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters. 
(5)  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the town separate storm sewer system. 
(6)  Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper nonstormwater discharges to the town separate storm sewer system. 
(b)  Therefore, the town adopted this article to prohibit such nonstormwater discharges to the town separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the town separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment. 
(Ord. No. 480, § 1, 12-1-2005)

No person may begin the physical development of a lot or structure thereon, where an on-site sewage management system will be utilized, nor install a new on-site sewage management system without having first applied for and obtained from the town or county health department a construction permit for the installation. 
(c)  Excavations, permanent surfaces and multiple structures. No person shall excavate nor utilize any hole or pit for the purpose of disposing of and burying any type of debris including site cleared material (i.e., logs, stumps), building materials, etc., on any lot or portion thereof which is proposed for development with an on-site sewage management system or where there is an existing system. Only areas preapproved by the health department and any other appropriate governmental jurisdiction for excavation and use of as a trash or debris pit as indicated on the permit to construct an on-site system shall be allowed as an exception to this regulation. All swimming pools, permanent surfaces and other permanent structures where individual on-site sewage management systems are existing or proposed shall be approved by the health department prior to construction. 
(d)  Requirements for on-site sewage management system construction permit issuance or denial. On-site sewage management system construction permits for conventional septic tank systems shall be issued only after a site inspection by the health department shows favorable findings relative to percolation rates, (or a certified soil scientist's report may be accepted in lieu of percolation test results) soil characteristics, groundwater, rock and any other factors which would affect the acceptability of the lot. For construction of conventional septic tank systems, the suitability of the lot must be demonstrated through acceptable soil characteristics and/or percolation rates of less than or equal to 90 min/inch; freedom from groundwater interference or other potential for contamination of groundwater by sewage; absence of impervious strata below the level of the absorption field and absence of undesirable topographic characteristics and other factors which singly, or in combination, affect the acceptability of the lot. Lot suitability and approval for other types of on-site sewage management systems is to be determined by criteria established by the department's manual. The town or county board of health may deny or revoke an on-site sewage management system construction permit upon finding the lot unsuitable or for failure of the applicant to comply with the provisions of these rules. Such denial shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the O.C.G.A. § 31-3-5. On-site sewage management construction permits shall remain valid for not more than 12 months from the date of issuance. 
(1)  Issuance of a construction permit for an on-site sewage management system, and subsequent approval of same by representative of the town or county board of health, shall not be construed as a guarantee that such systems will function satisfactorily for a given period of time; furthermore, said representatives do not, by an action taken in effecting compliance with these rules; assume any liability for damages which are caused, or which may be caused, by the malfunction of such system. 
(2)  Residential development requiring on-site sewage systems. No person may sell, offer for sale, lease, begin construction or otherwise begin the physical development of a residential development until all requirements set forth by the health department have been met. 
a.  Preliminary plat processing. Prior to the submission of any residential development to the appropriate governmental jurisdiction for review and approval, the developer shall comply with all the applicable requirements of this regulation. 
b.  Final plat processing. Prior to the approval of any residential development by the appropriate governmental jurisdiction, the health department shall review and approve the plat regarding water supply and sewage disposal. When on-site systems are proposed, lot restrictions shall be noted and recorded as part of the final plat. Unsuitable lots for development with on-site systems shall be recombined with lots approved on the preliminary plat by the health department, or set aside for nonsewage usage purposes. 
(3)  Application for such construction permit shall be made in writing, on forms provided by the town or county board of health. (See pages N-7 and N-8 of the manual.) The application shall include: 
a.  Name and address of the owner and the applicant, if other than the owner; 
b.  Location of the property; 
c.  Plans and specification including location and design of the proposed on-site sewage management system; 
d.  Nature of the facility to be served; 
e.  Location of all water supplies, on or adjacent to the lot, which will bear upon the location of the on-site sewage management system; 
f.  Number of bedrooms in the dwelling, or the number of persons to be served in other types of establishments, or other sewage flow or water usage data; 
g.  Soil characteristics, including soil types and capabilities, frequency and evaluations of seasonal high groundwater tables, occurrence of rock and other impervious strata; 
h.  Signature of owner or agent applying for the permit; 
i.  The following general data shall be submitted by the owner or agent for the owner for review and approval by the health department prior to its issuance of a permit to construct an on-site sewage management system. Specific data requirements are as listed in the current town or county health department "Data Requirements Individual Lot" checklist. 
1.  General site plan. The general site plan shall be based on a boundary survey certified by a land surveyor currently registered in the state, including all specific data as listed in the checklist; showing structure, permanent surfaces (i.e., pools, tennis courts and circular driveways). 
2.  Soil percolation data or certified scientist's reports may be accepted in lieu of percolation tests. 
3.  Soil borings. 
4.  An owner or agent for the owner may request an onsite review by the health department for a lot without obtaining a permit to construct the system. A fee shall be charged for this consultation service. An affirmative favorable opinion of a health department employee or a site visit does not infer nor guarantee the issuance of a permit to construct an on-site sewage management system. Submission of site plans, construction plans, etc., by any individual, owner, consultant firm, etc., shall not imply nor be construed to imply or infer any approval or preapproval of a site proposed to be developed with an on-site sewage management system. 
5.  However, part of the information required for the application may be waived, provided the town or county board of health deems that information is available from previously submitted subdivision or mobile home park data, or from other sources, sufficient to make an adequate appraisal of the acceptability of the proposed lot for on-site sewage management system installation. 
6.  If industrial wastes are planned to be discharged into an individual sewage disposal system, a letter from either the EPA or other related government agency, stating the approval to discharge industrial waste into the ground. 
7.  Additional data. Any other additional supportive data or information required by the health department not specified in the checklist shall be submitted including an individual lot grading/site plan, upon request. 
(e)  Inspection. No person may cover or use a new on-site management system, nor may a person cover or use a repair of an existing management system until final inspection has been made by the town or county board of health to determine compliance with the provisions of the construction permit issued under this section and written approval has been issued by the town or county board of health. 
(1)  A copy of the final inspection of an on-site sewage management system shall be provided to the owner, builder, developer or agent, whichever is appropriate. 
(2)  Any grading, filling or other landscaping or construction activities on the lot subsequent to final inspection by the town or county board of health which may adversely affect the on-site sewage management system shall render the approval void. 
(3)  The health department shall require random spot check inspections/excavations in areas covered for construction purposes to ensure compliance with the regulations. 
(4)  The septic tank contractor must have a copy of the valid health department permit and a responsible representative on site during the construction inspection. 
(5)  Failure to comply with these requirements will necessitate rescheduling the inspection and charging an additional fee. Continued disregard of these procedures may jeopardize contractor certification. 
(f)  Maintenance. It is the property owner's responsibility to maintain and operate the on-site sewage management system in a safe and sanitary manner so as not to constitute a public health hazard or nuisance. Where an on-site sewage management system is proposed to serve facilities under separate ownership, a contract to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the system, signed by all owners, shall exist as a precondition to the issuance of a permit for the construction of the on-site sewage management system. 
(g)  Prohibited discharge. No person shall allow the unapproved discharge or spillage of sewage, nor shall an on-site sewage management system be used or maintained in such a manner that will allow the seepage or discharge of effluent from such system to the ground surface, to a watercourse, drainage ditch, open trench, canal, storm drain or storm sewer, water well, abandoned well, lake, stream, river, estuary, groundwater or other body of water. 
(1)  In the event that a failure of an on-site sewage management system cannot be repaired, then either connection to a public or community sewerage system shall be made or the premises shall be vacated until connection to the public or community sewerage system can be completed. 
(2)  The health department may put signs or require signs to be posted on a premises prohibiting occupancy where a health hazard exists (i.e., failing on-site sewage management system). Signs shall be removed only by the health department. No one may occupy the premises until the health hazard is eliminated as approved by the health department. 
(h)  Design limits on conventional septic tank systems. To provide for the maintenance of sanitary conditions through the proper functioning of a conventional septic tank system for a reasonable period of time, no such system may be installed, constructed or used, having a septic tank design capacity of less than 750 gallons or more than 10,000 gallons, or where the total length of absorption trenches required would exceed 3,000 linear feet, or where the total absorption trench bottom area required would exceed 9,000 square feet. 
(i)  Submission of plans, specifications, and soil data. Plans, specifications, soil data and, if required, percolation test data, submitted to the town or county board of health for the purpose of obtaining a construction permit to install a central on-site sewage management system to serve a commercial, industrial or institutional facility, which will produce a sewage flow in excess of 2,000 gallons per day, a travel trailer and/or mobile home park, or multiple-family dwelling of two or more family units shall bear the registration number and signature of a registered professional engineer, certified and registered under the laws of this state. The town or county board of health may accept plans, specification, soil data and percolation test data for commercial, industrial or institutional facilities with sewage flows of 2,000 gallons or less per day and for single-family dwellings when prepared in accordance with these rules, by any person who demonstrates to the satisfaction of the town or county board of health that he has sufficient knowledge of on-site sewage management system design, soil evaluation, and of conducting percolation tests. 
(j)  Soil data acceptability. Soil data deemed to be acceptable by the town or county board of health shall include information on soil characteristics obtained from published soil surveys and/or unpublished reports and field data developed by the Soil Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture, or from special investigations conducted by a soil scientist. These soil scientist's reports may be accepted in lieu of percolation test results. 
(k)  All property requiring an individual residential or commercial sewage disposal system shall have at least two separate approvable designated areas within which sewage systems may be installed on the subject property. All such areas must meet total capacity requirements for the subject property as developed. At least one of the approval areas must demonstrate conditions sufficient for successful installation of a conventional sewage disposal system. One of the designated areas shall be utilized for the initial installation of the individual sewage disposal system at the time of the development of the property. The second designated area shall be available as the location of a replacement sewage disposal system in the event that the first system fails for any reason. Disturbance of any area designated for the replacement system, including grading, paving and burial of trash, shall not be permitted. The lead environmentalist, on behalf of the town or county board of health shall enforce this regulation and review any and all proposals for replacement system in the event of failure of the originally installed sewage disposal system. 
(l)  The minimum lot size or land area which may be served by a septic system shall be that lot size or land area required by the zoning ordinance as well as the rules and regulations adopted by the mayor and council. 
(Code 1984, § 5-2-3; Ord. No. 245, 2-17-1993) 
Sec. 16-29. - Connection to sewer. 
The owner, lessee or agent thereof of any building, residence or other facility designed or used for human occupancy or congregation, shall provide a system to dispose of the sewage generated within the building, residence or other facility. Connection shall be made to a public or community sewerage system when such system is available as indicated below: 
(1)  Commercial development. A public or community sewerage system shall be considered available if it is within a specified distance of the nearest property line as indicated in Table A set out at the end of this chapter; such distance being measured along the appropriate natural drainage course (gravity flow) and based on the maximum anticipated daily sewage flow (see Tables D and E set out at the end of this chapter for flow determination). Mandatory connection to a public or community sewerage system shall be required for commercial developments regardless of distance if the health department denies approval for construction of an on-site sewage management system including reserve area for any reason. 
(2)  Exception. In the event that a change in use occurs in an existing structure which may or may not require a zoning change, the new owner may be allowed to utilize the existing on-site sewage management system provided the following conditions are met: 
a.  Sewage flow. Change in use of the premises will not increase the anticipated maximum daily sewage flow that the existing on-site sewage management system is designed to handle as determined by the health department. 
b.  Proper operation. The existing system is properly operating, there are no signs of failure at the time of inspection by the health department and the system is in compliance with the regulations, or that any failure on record has had an approved repair. 
c.  Site changes. The owner or agent for the owner states in writing that no site changes will be made that would alter or affect the performance of the system (i.e., paving, parking or construction on top of the system). 
d.  Mandatory connection. The owner or agent for the owner agrees in writing to immediately connect to the public or community sewerage system, when available, should the on-site system fail. 
e.  Easement dedication. The owner or agent for the owner agrees in writing to provide all necessary easements at no cost for future public sewer at time of approval as required by the appropriate governmental jurisdiction. 
f.  Payment of fees. The owner or agent for the owner pays all necessary fees (including assessments and tap on) at the time of approval as required by the appropriate governmental jurisdiction. 
(3)  Residential development. A public or community sewerage system shall be considered available if it is within a specified distance of the nearest property line at the time of application. The distance indicated in Table B set out at the end of this chapter shall be measured along the appropriate natural drainage course (gravity flow) and based on the number of lots indicated on the preliminary plat. 
(4)  Abandonment of on-site sewage management system. When the use of an on-site sewage management system is discontinued following connection to a public or community sewerage system or the condemnation or demolition of a building or property, the system shall be abandoned and any further use shall be prohibited. The following actions shall be taken, in the order listed, to abandon an on-site sewage management system: 
a.  The tank shall be pumped out; 
b.  The bottom of the tank shall be opened or ruptured so as to prevent the tank from retaining water; and 
c.  The tank shall be filled with clean soil or other suitable material. 
(Code 1984, § 5-2-4; Ord. No. 245, 2-17-1993) 
Sec. 16-30. - Sewers. 
(a)  Size of sewers. Sewers connecting component parts of on-site sewage management systems shall be of sufficient size to serve anticipated flow conditions. 
(b)  Materials. All pipe or tile and fittings used in sewers and absorption fields shall meet nationally recognized standards for their designated use, such as standards published by the American Society for Testing and Materials or the National Sanitation Foundation, and approved by the town or county board of health for use in on-site sewage management systems. Sewers under driveways or similar areas of load or impact shall be of material capable of withstanding anticipated loads or installed so as to provide protection from crushing. 
(c)  Construction. Sewers, other than perforated pipe or drain tile used in absorption fields, shall be laid with sealed, watertight, root-resistant joints. Such sewers shall be laid on a firm foundation, and shall not be subject to settling, and shall be installed on a grade (see page N-3 of the Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems) that will ensure a self-cleaning velocity. Where on-site sewage management systems are used, and where installation of building drains and building sewers is not covered by duly adopted local plumbing codes, or in the absence of a local plumbing code and/or plumbing inspections, the town or county board of health shall verify the adequacy and acceptability of all or any portion of the building sewer or the building drain. 
(Code 1984, § 5-2-5; Ord. No. 245, 2-17-1993) 
Sec. 16-31. - Septic tanks. 
(a)  Minimum design and construction. Septic tanks shall be designed and constructed to equal or exceed minimum design and construction criteria established by the town or county board of health as published in the current manual for on-site sewage management systems. Any person seeking approval of septic tanks to be used in on-site sewage management systems after the effective date of these rules, shall submit detailed plans and specifications for tank manufacture and such other information as may be required by the town or county board of health. Manufacturers and suppliers shall be subject to periodic inspection, and approved by the town or county board of health. 
(b)  Location. No septic tank shall be installed within the minimum separation distances indicated in Table C, set out at the end of this chapter, from the referenced items (existing or proposed), nor in areas with fill material, or in areas subject to local flooding and ponding of surface runoff. Septic tanks shall be installed so as to provide ready access for necessary maintenance. The health department, after site inspection, may stipulate greater separation than cited herein, due to adverse on-site conditions such as location of a well on-site or nearby; site configuration or structure placement; subsurface soil characteristics and/or groundwater interference. Minimum separation distances from items not listed in said Table C shall be determined by the health department. 
(c)  Capacity. Minimum capacity for any septic tank shall be 750 gallons. The minimum tank size required for single-family dwellings with one or two bedrooms shall be 750 gallons, dwellings with three and four bedrooms shall be 1,000 gallons and dwellings with five bedrooms shall be 1,500 gallons. Total tank capacity will be increased by 250-gallon increments for each additional bedroom over five. Use of garbage grinders is not recommended in conjunction with on-site sewage management systems. If a grinder is to be utilized, then an additional 50 percent tank storage capacity shall be required (i.e., 500 gallons more for a 1,000-gallon system). The maximum tank capacity for a nonresidential on-site sewage management system shall be 10,000 gallons. 
(d)  Compartmented tanks. Compartmented tanks are permissible upon approval by the town or county board of health. 
(e)  Tank in series. The town or county board of health may approve the installation of two septic tanks placed in series provided that the capacity of the first tank is at least 750 gallons and at least equal to the capacity of the second tank. When tanks in series are used, they shall be connected with a sealed sewer line, and all sewage shall initially enter the first tank. 
(f)  Foundation and backfill. Septic tanks shall be constructed or installed level on a foundation of solid unexcavated ground (no fill) that will prevent settling. Backfill shall be free of voids, stumps, broken masonry or other such materials. A minimum earth cover of six inches over the tank is required with a maximum cover of 24 inches to maintain serviceability unless otherwise approved by the health department. 
(Code 1984, § 5-2-6; Ord. No. 245, 2-17-1993) 
Sec. 16-32. - Distribution boxes, dosing tanks and pumps. 
(a)  Distribution boxes. 
(1)  Minimum design and construction. Distribution boxes shall be designed and constructed in accordance with minimum design and construction criteria established in the department's current manual and this section. (See pages N-3 and N-5 of the Manual.) Approval procedures shall follow the requirements as set forth under section 16-31. 
(2)  Foundation. The foundation for distribution boxes shall be a four-inch thick concrete pad at least 12 inches beyond the wall of the distribution box. 
(3)  Capacity. The box shall be of sufficient capacity to temporarily store the effluent from the dosing tanks or effluent pumps during redistribution to the absorption trenches. The maximum liquid level shall be no less than four inches below the top of the box (bottom of the lid). 
(b)  Dosing tank. Where required, dosing tanks shall be designed, constructed and installed in accordance with the department's current manual. 
(c)  Sewage effluent pump. In the event that the sewage generated from a building or residence cannot be plumbed to an absorption field by gravity, then an on-site sewage management system may be modified by installing a sewage effluent pump (includes a grinder pump, if they discharge to an approved septic tank) with the necessary appurtenances as determined by the health department. Included but not limited to the following appurtenances are: a separate pump chamber from the septic tank, pump controls, level control malfunction, manhole cover, emergency bypass plumbing with 50 feet of drainline trench (minimum 36 inches wide), piping, fittings, alarms and distribution box for pump discharge prior to entering absorption field. All wiring shall be installed underground meeting electrical codes. All material specifications, warranties and construction plans must be submitted by the owner or agent for the owner and reviewed and approved by the health department, prior to issuance of a permit to construct the on-site sewage management system. Design and construction shall be in accordance with the specifications and details in the current Manual for On-Site Sewage Management System. 
(d)  In the event that a sewage effluent pump is utilized in a residential or commercial on-site sewage management system, a minimum of 50 feet of drainline and 36 inches trench width shall be constructed and used for emergency overflow in case the pumps malfunction or electrical power is temporarily interrupted. 
(Code 1984, § 5-2-7) 
Sec. 16-33. - Absorption field. 
(a)  Area computation. The determination of the absorption trench bottom area to be required shall be based upon both the maximum anticipated daily sewage flow from the proposed facility and upon the characteristics of the soil in which the absorption field is to be located. Soil characteristics shall include percolation rates determined by the Modified Taft Engineering Center method (or certified soil scientist's reports may be accepted in lieu of percolation tests) together with types of soil encountered, drainage conditions and other related data that may be required by the health department. 
(1)  Residential lots. 
a.  Trench bottom areas for residential on-site sewage management systems shall not be less than those shown below: 

 
b.  Two or more systems serving the same residence or building may require additional absorption trench area compared to that required for a single system. 
(2)  Commercial development. Total absorption trench bottom are for nonresidential, on-site sewage management systems shall not be less than the area obtained by multiplying the maximum anticipated daily sewage flow (gallons) by the percolation coefficient i.e., (one-fifth of the square root of the average percolation rate) (e.g., one-fifth percolation rate X gal. = total absorption trench bottom area). The maximum anticipated daily sewage flow shall be determined in accordance with the sewage flow schedule, Table D in section 16-43, or if a commercial facility is not included on the schedules, then a study will be made to determine what similar commercial facilities have as daily sewage flow. The maximum total absorption trench bottom area for a nonresidential/commercial on-site sewage management system shall be 9,000 square feet. The minimum size nonresidential/commercial on-site sewage management system shall include at least a 750-gallon septic tank and 300 square feet of absorption trench bottom area. 
(b)  Location. 
(1)  No absorption field shall be installed within the minimum separation distances indicated in Table C set out at the end of this chapter from the referenced items (existing or proposed), nor in areas with unsuitable fill material. 
(2)  Absorption fields shall not be installed where groundwater or adverse geological formations may interfere with the absorption of treated sewage or result in the contamination of groundwater. Absorption fields shall not be installed in areas subject to excessive surface water, ponding or runoff, including but not limited to stormwater and discharge from building gutters. Absorption fields shall not be installed where grade exceeds 20 percent. The health department, after site inspection, may require greater separation distances due to adverse conditions such as topography, subsurface soil characteristics, and/or groundwater sources. No part of the absorption field shall ever be covered by buildings, pavement or be used for vehicular traffic or parking. No absorption field shall be constructed less than 100 feet from existing or proposed wells; less than ten feet from water supply lines; less than ten feet from building foundations and property lines; less than 15 feet from an embankment nor less than 50 feet from the normal water level of any impoundment, tributary, stream or other body of water. If it becomes necessary for the absorption field to be within ten feet of a water supply line, the water supply line within ten feet of the absorption field shall be at least 12 inches above the top of the aggregate layer of the absorption line and shall be encased in a single length of water pipe. 
(c)  Minimum design and construction for conventional systems. Absorption trenches shall be on grade throughout, shall be no less than 25 inches, nor more than 48 inches in depth, shall be 36 inches in width (unless otherwise approved in writing by the health department prior to installation) and shall enable placement of at least 13 inches of backfill on top of gravel bed. If unfavorable soil conditions (i.e., high clay content) are encountered at normal installation depths, trenches may be installed at greater depths if approved by the health department, site modifications are performed, acceptable percolation test rates can be shown to exist at these depths, and the soil meets all requirements for installation of absorption fields with respect to work, groundwater elevations and other geological factors. Absorption trenches shall be spaced not less than seven feet apart between trench walls. Perforated pipe shall be laid in the center of the trench with perforations oriented toward the bottom of the trench and appropriate fittings used where needed. Pipe crossings under roadways or paved areas shall not be considered in determining the total absorption trench bottom area. If trash pits are encountered during construction, then an absorption trench bypass must be installed in accordance with Detail B meeting the approval of the health department. Aggregate shall be placed under the absorption line to a minimum depth of six inches and shall extend the full width of the trench and two inches of aggregate shall cover the absorption line (total depth of aggregate shall be a minimum of 12 inches). Excavation for absorption trenches in wet clay soils and smearing of trench walls and bottoms should be avoided so that permeability will not be reduced. Approvals may be withheld where such damage has occurred. Absorption fields shall not be installed in areas where percolation test rates exceed 90 minutes per inch. 
(d)  Field layout methods. Absorption fields shall be designed and installed in accordance with one of the following methods: 
(1)  Distribution box method. The distribution box method may be used on level or moderately sloping topography, and shall be required when dosing tanks are used. A concrete foundation for distribution boxes extending at least 12 inches beyond the walls of the box shall be provided to ensure against tilting of the distribution box. Extreme care should be exercised in backfilling around and over the distribution box. The top of the distribution box shall have a minimum earth cover of six inches, but not more than 24 inches unless provisions are made for ready access to the distribution box. Effluent lines from the septic tank, dosing tank or pump chamber shall terminate inside the distribution box via an elbow turned downward to form a submerged inlet of normal water level. Equal absorption trench lengths, not exceeding 100 linear feet shall be connected to distribution box outlets by independent sewers, consisting of schedule 40 PVC pipe. Absorption lines of equal lengths shall be connected to distribution box outlets by independent sewers. Absorption trenches may be installed at the same elevation or at different elevations, but all sewers leading from the distribution box outlet to the absorption lines shall be installed at the same elevation and shall be level on a solid bed of aggregate for two feet and shall be sealed watertight. Beginning two feet from the distribution box, the grade of such sealed lines shall be not less than one-eighth inch per foot. Absorption lines shall be laid on a uniform grade of not less than two inches nor more than four inches per 100 feet with a minimum of two inches recommended. An increased number of shorter trenches is recommended rather than the use of fewer longer trenches. 
(2)  Level field method. On level topography, the level field method may be used. When this method is used, the absorption field shall be installed level, with all absorption lines interconnected to form a continuous system. A standard tee fitting or distribution box shall be used to interconnect the absorption lines. 
(3)  Serial distribution method. When the serial distribution method is used, level absorption trenches shall be constructed along land contours. The sewer from the septic tank shall enter the uppermost absorption line and terminate at any point in the line so that all sewage from the septic tank is discharged into the first line. Adjacent absorption lines shall be successively connected by means of overflow sewers constructed at any point along the line in such a manner that each trench is filled with effluent to the full depth of aggregate before the effluent flows through the overflow sewer to the next trench. The invert of the first overflow sewer must be at least four inches lower than the invert of the septic tank outlet. At the point where an overflow sewer leaves an absorption trench, the excavation for the overflow sewer shall be dug no deeper than the top of the aggregate in the absorption trench, so that an undisturbed block of earth will remain in place for the full depth of the aggregate. Overflow sewers connecting absorption trenches shall be laid on undisturbed earth. Overflow sewers shall be nonperforated. Overflow sewer connections will be necessary, only to maintain required trench depths. A minimum of 12 inches of earth cover will be required over overflow sewers. 
(Code 1984, § 5-2-8; Ord. No. 245, 2-17-1993) 
Sec. 16-34. - Privies. 
Privies shall be designed and constructed in accordance with minimum design and construction criteria established by the current On-Site Sewage Management System Manual. 
(Code 1984, § 5-2-9; Ord. No. 245, 2-17-1993) 
Sec. 16-35. - Alternative and experimental on-site sewage management systems and site modifications. 
(a)  Alternative systems will be considered for use when existing conventional systems have failed and cannot be repaired by conventional methods and public or private sewers are not available. The department recognizes that on-site sewage management systems employing solids retention and on-site soil absorption of sewage effluent, if designed properly and installed in suitable soil, are usually ecologically safe and do adequately protect the public health. 
(b)  The department further recognizes that substantial portions of the state's undeveloped land area are marginally suitable or totally unsuitable for conventional septic tank systems, and that continued installation of such systems will have a detrimental effect on public health. Where appropriate, and after thorough assessment of alternatives, the town or county board of health will consider alternative on-site sewage management systems and/or modifications for areas with soils which may have only marginal suitability in their present condition, including community-managed, on-site sewage management systems and combinations of public or community sewage treatment systems and on-site sewage management systems. 
(c)  When considering proposals for alternative on-site sewage management systems, priority shall be given to those situations where the alternative system will resolve an existing sewage management problem. Any person or community desiring to install an alternative on-site sewage management system shall submit the following information to the town or county board of health: 
(1)  Plans and specifications, along with any engineering, laboratory or field data required; 
(2)  Information as required on the application for an individual on-site sewage management system construction permit, and any additional information as may be required by the town or county board of health. If the proposal for the system is approved, the person making the application will be informed by the town or county board of health of any requirements for maintenance, and any monitoring procedures of water usage by the installation of water conserving fixtures and devices should be considered in overall strategy. 
(d)  Experimental on-site sewage management systems. The town or county board of health may consider proposals for the use of experimental on-site sewage management systems. Acceptance or denial of such proposals shall depend on many site- and system-specific factors, including a primary consideration that the remainder of the site is suitable for the conventional septic tank system in the event of failure of the experimental system. 
(e)  Site modifications. Approval of certain lots determined to be unsuitable for conventional septic tank systems, may be reconsidered if appropriate site modifications are carried out to eliminate or significantly ameliorate unfavorable site characteristics. Modifications may include surface or subsurface drainage system, filling, grading, etc. Any person desiring to modify a lot for the purpose of obtaining a construction permit for installation of an on-site sewage management system shall submit for approval detailed plans showing the type and extent of modifications. The town or county board of health may require any additional information or clarification needed for formulating a proper decision on the proposed modifications. No modifications shall be carried out prior to the approval and issuance of a construction permit. 
(Code 1984, § 5-2-10; Ord. No. 245, 2-17-1993) 
Sec. 16-36. - Percolation tests and test borings. 
(a)  Percolation tests. 
(1)  If conducted, percolation tests shall not be considered presumptive or conclusive evidence as to the suitability of a given lot for the use of on-site sewage management systems. Such tests shall be considered and analyzed as one of many criteria in determining soil suitability. Acceptable data on soil characteristics, including the location of rock strata and water table evaluations, will be considered of primary importance. Percolation tests, if conducted, will be used to augment or supplement the soils data. It should be further understood that percolation tests conducted during dry weather periods in areas that commonly experience high seasonal water table elevations during wet periods of the year will often exhibit very good percolation rates, thus inaccurately portraying the absorptive capacity of the soil during wet periods. Percolation tests shall be run in accordance with the modified Taft Engineering Center method published in the department's current manual for on-site sewage management systems. 
(2)  Certified soil scientists' reports may be accepted in lieu of percolation tests, but for subdivisions, soil scientist's reports must be submitted at the preliminary stage of approval and noted on all subdivision plats. 
(b)  Location and number. 
(1)  Percolation test holes should be located in the area proposed for the installation of the absorption field. Data from test holes in areas outside of, or clearly uncharacteristic of, the proposed installation site will not be allowed. Percolation tests shall not be conducted in holes created by the deterioration of stumps and roots, or any other area which would render results that inaccurately portray the absorptive capacity of the soil in the absorption field area, such as in or near streams, floodplains, easements, embankments, gullies. All percolation test holes shall be flagged, staked and numbered in accordance with soil data record form. 
(2)  Percolation test holes shall be spaced at least 50 feet apart. (Spacing may be reduced if approved by the health department.) The number of tests shall be sufficient to obtain a proper appraisal of the absorptive capacity of the soil in the proposed absorption field area and shall be a minimum of three percolation tests performed for lots up to two acres, and two percolation tests for lots two acres and above. 
(3)  The number of tests required for preliminary appraisal of subdivisions may be specified in lesser numbers, provided a general overview of the soil characteristic of the total subdivision acreage is provided. Percolation test holes shall be located by number on a topographic map showing lot designations, boundaries, easements, etc., and the results shall be recorded on the map. 
(c)  Test boring for rock, shale, hardpan and water table. 
(1)  Where surface outcropping or subsurface formations raise reasonable doubt concerning the operational effectiveness of on-site sewage management systems, a sufficient number of test borings to an appropriate depth may be required by the town or county board of health to determine whether on-site sewage management systems can be expected to give satisfactory service (see section 16-28). Such borings and the results shall be located by number and recorded on the topographic map unless otherwise specified by the health department. Borings will be done to six-foot depth, and for water table evaluation should be examined after at least 12 hours. 
(2)  Borings shall not be located in easements, or other areas restricted by the regulation. 
(d)  Notification when conducting percolation tests and borings. Individuals conducting percolation tests and/or test borings shall notify the town or county board of health at least 24 hours prior to performing these procedures and, at the option of the department or town or county board of health, such procedures shall be performed in the presence of a department or town or county board of health representative.

ARTICLE XI. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 22-581. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the town and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the town. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent or the effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor the effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
(b)  Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the mayor and council, and on studies in other communities, including but not limited to the experience of the cities of College Park, Forest Park, Marietta, and Smyrna, the mayor and council finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary, unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. The commercial exploitation of human sexuality, in all forms in which such exploitation may be manifested has a deleterious effect on the community where it takes place as heretofore mentioned and that such effects are intensified and exacerbated when such is provided in conjunction with the service or consumption of alcohol. There is a correlation between sexually oriented businesses and an increase in criminal behavior in nearby areas, including but not limited to disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. 
(2)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. 
(3)  Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which create unhealthy conditions. Further, such establishments escalate undesirable community conditions, including blight, diminished property values, and cause increases in the need for law enforcement and emergency medical response resources, increases in the burden on the judicial system as a result of the criminal behavior which the mayor and council finds such business establishments bring to a community. The negative effects such businesses cause are not limited to such facilities that offer live or recorded performances with human nudity or the depiction of sexual acts but that other forms of sexually oriented businesses also have deleterious effect on nearby neighborhoods, commercial districts and on urban life in general. These other types of such businesses include, but are not limited to, adult bookstores, peep shows, massage parlors, bathhouses, adult gift and novelty shops, and lingerie or nude modeling studios. 
(4)  Communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses. AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected blood and blood components. 
(5)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities there are unhealthy, and in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
(6)  The findings noted in subsections (b)(1) through (5) of this section raise substantial governmental concerns. Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(7)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the town. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(8)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult entertainment establishments. 
(9)  Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
(10)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(11)  The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the town will be promoted by the enactment of this article.

Sec. 22-582. - Punishment for violation; abatement of nuisance; jurisdiction; injunction. 
(a)  The violation of any of the provisions of this article and upon an adjudication of guilt of a violation, the municipal court may impose sentences and fines thereupon as provided in section 1-7. 
(b)  The violation of any of the provisions of this article shall raise a rebuttable presumption that such conduct constitutes a nuisance and an action for abatement thereof may be brought by the town in the municipal court. 
(c)  The town, in its sole discretion, may also pursue an action for an injunction in a court of competent jurisdiction for any violation of this article.

(Code 1984, § 4-2-20) 
Sec. 32-4. - Violations. 
(a)  Notification of owner and/or tenant. Whenever it appears that any provision of this chapter is being violated, the town manager or his designee shall notify, in writing, the owner or occupant if different from the owner, or both, of the alleged violation. Such notice shall specify the violation involved, the corrective action needed, and shall state that if such corrective action is not completed within ten days, or such other time as the town may establish, a citation will be issued for violation of the chapter. Notice shall be by personal service or by certified mail. Any time periods provided in this chapter shall be deemed to commence on the date of the receipt of the certified mail or on the date of personal service.

(b)  Recovery of town expenses. 
(1)  Upon conviction for a violation of this chapter, or upon the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the town manager or his designee may, in addition to any other remedies that may be available, cause the violation to be corrected by use of town equipment and employees. In the event the town does not have sufficient equipment and/or employees to perform the removal, the town manager, with approval of the mayor, may contract with outside forces for the removal of said violation. The cost to the town of removing any such violation shall be a lien against the property, and shall be placed on the tax records of the town and county, as provided herein. 
(2)  If any of the conditions specified in this chapter are abated at town expense, the town shall assess a lien against the property for the cost hereinafter described.

(c)  Owner and occupant liable.

All fees for connection to the sewer system shall be paid as a prerequisite for approval of the connection to the sewer system. The following shall control the collection of the fees: 
(1)  Deposit. The town may accept a deposit reflecting the estimated cost of installing the water meter or connecting the use to sewer, pending final determination of actual costs after the work has been completed. 
(2)  Impact fee schedule. Fees paid on the basis of the impact fee schedule as then established by the town, to which the direct cost of connection has been added, shall constitute full and complete payment and shall be deemed to be in compliance with this section. 
(3)  Fees calculated on average daily basis. 
a.  For water or sewer impact fees proposed to be calculated on the basis of average gallon-per-day usage instead of the impact fee schedule, the applicant shall present credible evidence prepared, certified and sealed by a knowledgeable professional engineer (P.E.) registered in the state acceptable to the town, or other person acceptable to the town, regarding the projected water usage of the proposed use. Such evidence shall be based on other similar uses, historical water usage by the same type of use, engineering calculations based on accepted standards and practices, or other data or procedures acceptable to the town. 
b.  The payment of an impact fee calculated on the basis of average daily usage may be accepted by the town as a conditional payment, pending actual water usage experienced by the use over a 12-month period of full operation or occupancy. 
(4)  Appeals. The town manager or his designee shall have the authority to interpret this section and the calculation of appropriate connection fees, including both impact fees and direct connection costs to the town. Any aggrieved applicant for connection to the water or sewer system may appeal the decision of the town manager to the town council, whose determination shall be final.

(Ord. No. 505, § I(5-2-19(6)), 6-7-2007) 
Sec. 38-208. - General criteria. 
(a)  Installation requirements for new food service facilities. All proposed or newly remodeled food service facilities inside the town wastewater service area shall be required to install an approved, properly operated and maintained grease interceptor. All interceptor units shall be installed outdoors of the food service facility building unless the user can demonstrate to the town that an outdoor interceptor would not be feasible. All interceptor units shall of the type and capacity approved by the town. 
(b)  Prohibited discharges. Domestic wastewater shall not be discharged to the grease interceptor unless specifically approved, in writing, by the town. 
(c)  Requirements for existing food service facilities. All existing food service facilities inside the town wastewater service area are expected to conduct their operations in such a manner that grease is captured on the user's premises and then properly disposed. Existing food service facilities will be handled under the town grease management program in the following manner: 
(1)  Town will periodically inspect each food service facility on an as-needed basis to assure that each facility is complying with the intent of the grease control program. The as needed inspection shall be determined by the town. 
(2)  Each food service facility in the vicinity of the problem area will be inspected. The facilities' grease control practices and the adequacy of their grease control interceptor/equipment will be assessed. Maintenance records will also be reviewed. 
(3)  Following the inspections, the town will send written notice to the inspected food service facilities, containing a summary of the policy requirements, and the results of the inspection. The inspections will typically result in one of the following actions: 
a.  Facilities equipped with an appropriate and adequately sized grease interceptor who are meeting the intent of the grease management program through effective grease control practices will be commended for their compliance. 
b.  After notice and an opportunity to be heard, facilities not in compliance shall be required to develop and submit to the town proposed plan designed to achieve compliance through improved housekeeping and/or increased maintenance and pumping on the existing grease interceptor/equipment. 
c.  Facilities that are not successful in achieving compliance with the intent of the grease management program through improved housekeeping and increased maintenance and pumping on the existing grease interceptor/equipment will be required to install the necessary interceptor/equipment to bring the facility into compliance 
(d)  Waste minimization plan. Food service facilities shall develop and implement a waste minimization plan pertaining to the disposal of grease, oils, and food particles. 
(e)  Floor drains. Only floor drains which discharge or have the potential to discharge grease shall be connected to a grease interceptor. 
(f)  Location. Each grease interceptor shall be installed and connected so that it is easily accessible for inspection, cleaning, and removal of the intercepted grease at anytime. Grease interceptors required under this article shall be installed outdoors of the food service facility. The best location is in an area outside of an exterior wall, but upstream from the domestic wastewater drain line. A grease interceptor may not be installed inside any part of a building unless approved in writing by the town. The user bears the burden of demonstrating that an outdoor grease interceptor is not feasible. 
(Ord. No. 505, § I(5-2-19(3)), 6-7-2007) 
Sec. 38-209. - Design criteria. 
(a)  Construction of interceptors. Grease interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with the town's plumbing standards and outdoor units shall have a minimum of two compartments with fittings designed for grease retention. All alternative grease removal devices or technologies shall be subject to the written approval of the town. Such approval shall be based on demonstrated removal efficiencies of the proposed technology. 
(b)  Access. Outdoor grease interceptors shall be provided with two manholes terminating one inch above finished grade with cast iron frame and cover. All grease interceptors shall be designed and installed to allow for complete access for inspection and maintenance of inner chambers as well as viewing and sampling of wastewater discharged to the sanitary sewer. 
(c)  Load-bearing capacity. In areas where additional weight loads may exist, the grease interceptor shall be designed to have adequate load-bearing capacity (example: vehicular traffic in parking or driving areas). 
(d)  Inlet and outlet piping. Wastewater discharging to the grease interceptor shall enter only through the inlet pipe of the interceptor. The inlet pipe bottom tee branch shall extend one foot below liquid level. The outlet pipe bottom tee branch shall be submerged to two-thirds of the liquid depth. Each grease interceptor shall have only one inlet and one outlet pipe. 
(e)  Interceptor sizing. Outdoor grease interceptors shall not have a capacity of less than 1,500 gallons nor exceed a capacity of 3,000 gallons. No matter what the calculated capacity using the following formulas, the minimum interceptor size shall be 1,500 gallons. If the calculated capacity using one of the following formulas exceeds 3,000 gallons, then multiple units in series shall be installed. The size of a grease interceptor shall be approximated by the following methods and grease interceptor size shall be the larger of the two results: 
(1)  Interceptor Capacity (gallons) = (S) × (25) × (Hr/12) 
S = Number of Seats 
Hr=Maximum hours of daily operation (Include preparation & clean up) 
(2)  Interceptor Capacity (gallons) = (Sum of fixture flows) × (20) 

 
(3)  Under-sink or in-line grease interceptor requirements shall meet Plumbing and Drainage Institute Standard PDI-G101: 

 
(f)  Grease interceptor designs represent minimum standards for normal usage. Installations with heavier usage require more stringent measures for which the user is responsible and shall pay the costs to provide additional measures if required by the town. The town reserves the right to evaluate interceptor sizing on an individual basis for facilities with special conditions, such as highly variable flows, high levels of grease discharge, or other unusual situations that are not adequately addressed by the formula. 
(Ord. No. 505, § I(5-2-19(4)), 6-7-2007) 
Sec. 38-210. - Grease interceptor maintenance. 
(a)  Pumping. All grease interceptors shall be maintained by the user at the user's expense. Maintenance shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, and bottom sludges and solids. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the interceptor from which the waste was removed or any other grease interceptor, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed, is strictly prohibited. 
(b)  Pumping frequency. Outdoor grease interceptors must be pumped out completely a minimum of once every three months. Under-sink or in-line grease interceptors must be pumped/cleaned out completely a minimum of once every month. Grease interceptors may need to be pumped more frequently as needed to prevent carry over of grease into the sanitary sewer collection system. Pumping frequency may be extended past the minimum period if it can be demonstrated by the user and approved by town. 
(c)  Pump out order. When the oil and grease concentrations exceed the town's maximum discharge limits and/or the combined depth of bottom and top solids exceeds 33 percent of the total depth of the trap, town will issue a pump out order to the user. The user shall have seven days from receipt of the order to comply. Where an emergency exists, a written or verbal warning shall be given to the user, and the user will have 24 hours to comply. 
(d)  Disposal of interceptor pumped material. All waste removed from each grease interceptor shall be recorded on a proper manifest form. Also, all waste removed from each grease interceptor must be disposed at a facility approved by the Town of Tyrone to receive such waste in accordance with the provisions of this program. In no way shall the pumped material be returned to any private or public portion of the sanitary sewer collection system. 
(e)  Additives. Any additives placed into the grease interceptor or building discharge line system on a constant, regular, or scheduled basis shall be reported to the town. Such additives shall include, but are not be limited to commercially available bacteria or other additives designed to absorb, consume, or treat fats, oils, and grease. The use of additives shall in no way be considered as an alternative technology or a substitution for maintenance procedures required herein. 
(f)  Chemical treatment. Chemical treatments such as drain cleaners, enzymes, acids, and other chemicals designed to dissolve, purge, or remove grease shall not be allowed to enter the grease interceptor.

ARTICLE V. - TYRONE UNDERGROUND MARKING STANDARDS 

Sec. 38-225. - Definitions 
The following words are to be understood consistent with the definitions contained herein as applicable to this article. 
Emergency means a sudden or unforeseen occurrence involving a clear and imminent danger to life, health, or property; the interruption of utility services; or repairs to transportation facilities that require immediate action.

Such extraordinary circumstances may include, but shall not be limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, ice and snow, and acts of God. 
(Ord. No. 2014-03, § 2, 2-6-2014) 
Sec. 38-226. - White lining. 
(a)  Background. White lining is a practice that has been widely used in the United States where the National Transportation Board concluded that pre-marking is a practice that helps prevent excavation damage. The procedure simply involves an excavator using white paint to indicate the route or area that is going to be excavated, such that the locator then knows exactly how much marking is required and where. White lining reduces confusion about what utilities need to be marked or not marked. 
(b)  Purpose. The purpose of white lining is to allow everyone involved with the dig site to know the exact location of the proposed excavation. White lining the excavation site is an excellent way to assist the utilities or utility locators in marking lines in the work area right the first time and in less time. This technique eliminates speculation by the locator about where the excavation will take place and will often enable the utility or its agent to locate faster and more accurately. In short, pre-marking the area and the extent of the intended excavation can reduce delays and the time it takes to perform the locate. 
(c)  Examples; timing. Examples of areas to be white lined are smaller (involving only a portion of a particular address) or linear excavations such as telecommunication drops and lines, service lines (such as for water, gas, electricity and sewer), utility pits, cuts and repairs, curb repairs, bore holes, directional boring pathways, pole and signage placements, etc. Such examples are merely explanatory of the type of excavation where white lining is appropriate and are not meant to be exclusive. White lining shall be completed prior to contacting GA811 to obtain a locate request ticket number. Electronic/virtual white lining shall be clearly marked on submitted documentation within a 20-foot tolerance zone of the proposed excavation site. 
(d)  Exceptions to white lining. Exceptions are allowed as follows: 
(1)  For large projects as defined in O.C.G.A. § 25-9-3(18), unless one or more utility facilities are damaged three times or more collectively by a contractor making the locate request within a 90-day contract period, white lining will not be required for any large project so designated in accordance with GSPC Rule 515-9-4-.13. A copy of GSPC Rule 515-9-4-.13 currently in effect is attached to Ordinance No. 2014-03 as Exhibit "A" and by this reference is incorporated herein; said exhibit is on file in the town offices. Every contractor begins each large project with zero damages. It is only when three damages (at-fault damages) occur during the 90-day period of the specific large project that the white lining requirement will be triggered. A large project ticket holder whose past prohibits it from being exempt, as stated above, will be subject to no more than a two-day shutdown period and shall be required to white line the remainder of the project to meet the large project marking facility locating agreement schedule that the ticket holder and utility originally agreed upon; 
(2)  Homeowners/occupants involved in excavation or land disturbance that is confined to a single address or parcel. Homeowners/occupants shall not submit locate requests for excavation or land disturbance that will be performed by a business, a contractor, or a utility. Businesses, contractors, and utilities are not exempt from white lining; 
(3)  "Emergencies" and "extraordinary circumstances" as such terms are defined herein, are statutory exceptions to the requirement for obtaining a locate ticket prior to commencing mechanized excavation and, hence, also exceptions to the requirement for white lining under this section. However, if a particular emergency notification is later determined not to have been an emergency or an extraordinary circumstance, then the excavator's failure to procure a locate ticket before excavating will be treated as a violation of this section. Also, pre-excavation emergency locate ticket requests (that is, a request for a locate ticket on an expedited basis sooner than the prescribed time limit) will not be an exception to white lining as required in this section; 
(4)  Residential telecommunication service drop lines that can be delineated by the route of the existing line on the ground for single residential address/parcel requests only; and 
(5)  Termite baiting systems. 
(e)  White lining symbols as directions to locator. White lining proposed dig sites that will follow a single path or trench shall be marked using white lines and/or arrows and shall be located for 20 feet on either side of the white line and for 20 feet outward beyond the designated "START" and "END" of such linear white line. Therefore, it is important to identify the starting and ending points. 

(f)  Identification of white lining excavator. In order to enable the locating utility or its locators to quickly identify the requested locate at the job site and expedite the locating process, such excavator when white lining shall identify himself or itself by labeling the white line area with the excavator's name or the applicable locate ticket number or both. 
(Ord. No. 2014-03, § 3, 2-6-2014; Ord. No. 2015-05, §§ 1, 2, 8-6-2015) 
Sec. 38-227. - Facility marking by or for utilities. 
(a)  Utility markings. Facility owners or their locate contractors shall indicate utility facilities by placing their UPC alpha code, along with the type material (if known) that the facility consists of, at the beginning and end of locates. Also, arrows should be placed at the ends of markings to indicate that the underground facility continues. In accomplishing the locate task, the line locator shall use industry-approved and generally accepted methods of locating. The tolerance zone shall be 18 inches measured horizontally from the outer edge of either side of such marked utility facilities. 
(1)  To avoid confusion on long runs, the marks shall be frequent enough to identify the owner. 
(2)  The marks shall indicate the approximate center-line of the underground lines. For example, the middle of the cable, line or pipe shall be at the center of the dashed marks. 
(3)  Location marks shall be four to 12 inches in length and at intervals of five to ten feet. If the facility to be marked has a greater diameter than 12 inches the size of the facility shall be indicated if known. If size is not known, then the mark shall be greater than 12 inches. 

(4)  The line locator (person marking the lines) shall extend marks outside the proposed work area by 20 to 30 feet if those facilities extend outside the proposed excavation area. 

(5)  In areas such as flower beds, rock gardens, etc., flags or stakes may be an alternative to paint. The decision to use flags, paint, or stakes shall be based on the terrain and job conditions. For instance, flags or stakes in wet areas, offsets in dirt construction zones that have a high volume of traffic crossing their line location marks. 

(6)  Dead ends, stub-outs, termination points, etc., shall be marked as follows: 

(7)  Lines that have connections (e.g., T's or Y's) or changes in directions shall be clearly indicated. Marks indicating lines or connections shall clearly show the intersection and path of the line or connection. Marks that show changes in direction shall be placed closer together for more clarity and accuracy. 

(8)  Manholes and valves shall be identified by using a circle and letters if they are not visible (dirt covering valve boxes or pavement covering manhole cover). 

(9)  Facilities that cross but do not intersect shall be marked as described to indicate such installation manner. 

(10)  Unlocateable sewer laterals shall be marked by placing a green triangle on the sewer main and, if the location of the tap for such unlocateable sewer lateral is known, by placing a green "T" or "Y" or other appropriate symbol at the tap pointing generally toward the address served by such unlocateable sewer lateral. 

(11)  When facilities share the same trench, they shall be heavily identified and separated enough so that they can be readily identified. This would apply to lines that share the same color code. For example, cable television and telephone lines: 

(12)  If the facility to be marked has a diameter greater than 12 inches, the size of the facility shall be indicated if known. If the size is not known, then the mark shall indicate greater than 12 inches. 
(13)  Duct structures shall be marked by using a dot with parallel boundary on each side of the dot. 

(14)  In areas where there is a strong likelihood that any or all marker types showing line location would be destroyed, offsets shall be placed on a permanent surface. However, offsets should be used only in conjunction with marks placed above a facility. Offset spacing should be every third or fourth mark. For example, the following mark would indicate the line is 16 feet from the end of the arrow. 

(15)  In areas where cables are spliced, the facilities should be located individually as far as possible on both sides of the splice. When the signal is distorted due to the near proximity to the splice a circle with "SP" should indicate the area of distortion or "splice pit". 

(Ord. No. 2014-03, § 4, 2-6-2014; Ord. No. 2015-05, §§ 3, 4, 8-6-2015) 
Sec. 38-228. - Facility protection/damage prevention requirements for contractors/excavators/utilities. 
(a)  When excavating is to take place within the tolerance zone, the contractor/excavator/utility shall utilize at least one of the following: hand digging, pot holing, soft digging, vacuum excavation methods, pneumatic hand tools, or other mechanical methods that may be developed. Other mechanical methods may be used with the approval of the facility owner or operator. 
(b)  Any person involved in an excavation with mechanized equipment found digging or performing land disturbing activities within the "Tolerance Zone" of a facility without evidence of "Potholing" will be found to be in violation of this article. 
(c)  The tolerance zone shall be 18 inches measured horizontally from the outer edge of either side of such marked utility facilities.

Building permit means the permit required for new construction pursuant to the town building code. The term "building permit" shall not include permits required for remodeling, rehabilitation or other improvements to an existing structure, provided there is no increase in the number of units resulting therefrom. 
Capital improvement means an improvement with a useful life of ten years or more, by new construction or other action, which increases the service capacity of a public facility. 
Capital improvements element means that portion of the comprehensive plan which sets out projected needs for system improvements during a planning horizon established in the comprehensive plan, a schedule of capital improvements that will meet the anticipated need for system improvements, and a description of anticipated funding sources for each required improvement. 
Commencement of construction or commenced construction means expenditure of any funds, whether they be development impact fee funds or not, for a public facilities project, marshaling of forces to undertake a public facilities project, or advertising of bids to undertake a public facilities project, or any action normally found to proceed subsequent to these actions in a typical flow of project construction activities. 
Developer means any person or legal entity undertaking development. 
Development means any construction or expansion of a building, structure, or use, any change in use of a building or structure, or any change in the use of land, any of which creates additional demand and need for public facilities. 
Development approval means any written authorization from the town which allows the commencement of construction. 
Development exaction means a requirement attached to a development approval or other municipal or county action approving or authorizing a particular development project, including but not limited to a rezoning, which requirement compels the payment, dedication or construction of goods, services, land or money as a condition of approval.

Encumber means to legally obligate by contract, or otherwise commit to use by appropriation or other official act of the town. 
Excess capacity means capacity of a public facility or system of public facilities which is beyond that necessary to provide service at a specified level of service. 
Feepayor means that person who pays a development impact fee, or his successor in interest, where the right or entitlement to any refund of previously paid development impact fees has been expressly transferred or assigned to the successor in interest. In the absence of an express transfer or assignment of the right or entitlement to any fund of previously paid development impact fees, the right or entitlement shall be deemed "not to run with the land." 
Individual assessment study means the engineering and/or economic documentation prepared by a feepayor to allow determination of a development impact fee other than by use of an applicable fee schedule, as required by O.C.G.A. § 36-71-4(g).

The character of the improvement shall control a determination of whether an improvement is a project improvement or system improvement, and the physical location of the improvement on-site or off-site shall not be considered determinative. If an improvement or facility provides, or will provide, more than incidental service or facilities capacity to persons other than users or occupants of a particular project, the improvement or facility is a system improvement and shall not be considered a project improvement. No improvement or facility included in a plan for public facilities approved by the governing body of the town shall be considered a project improvement.

Projected interest charges and other finance costs may be included if the impact fees are to be used for the payments of principal and interest on bonds, notes or other financial obligations issued by or on behalf of the town to finance the capital improvements element, but such costs do not include routine and periodic maintenance expenditures, personnel training and other operating costs. 
System improvements means capital improvements that are public facilities and are designed to provide service to the community at large, in contrast to project improvements.

Sec. 101-68. - Credits. 
(a)  In the calculation of development impact fees for a particular project, credits shall be given for the present value of any construction of improvements, contribution, dedication of land, or money required or accepted by the town from a developer, or his predecessor in title or interest, for system improvements of the category for which the development impact fee is being collected. Credits shall not be given for project improvements. 
(b)  In the event a building permit is abandoned, credit shall be given for the present value of the development impact fee against future development impact fees for the same parcel of land. 
(c)  Credits under subsection (a) of this section shall be valued using the following guidelines: 
(1)  For the present value of the construction of any system improvements required or accepted, in conjunction with the project for which approval is being sought, by the town from the developer or predecessor in title or interest for the category of system improvements in the service area for which the development impact fee is being collected, the developer must present evidence of the costs and age of the improvement from which present value may be calculated using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent) as estimates of inflation and depreciation. 
(2)  For the present value of any contribution or dedication of land required or accepted for system improvements, in conjunction with the project for which approval is being sought by the town from the developer or predecessor in title or interest for the category of system improvements in the service area for which the development impact fee is being collected, the value for contributed land shall be the same as that attributed to the property by the current validated town tax appraisal at the time of dedication; present value shall be calculated from the time of dedication using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent). 
(3)  For the present value of any contribution or dedication of money required or accepted, in conjunction with the project for which approval is being sought, by the town from the developer or predecessor in title or interest for the system improvements in the service area for which the development impact fee is being collected, the value of contributed money shall be the same as that at the time of contribution or dedication; present value shall be calculated from time of contribution or dedication using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent). 
(d)  Upon submission of adequate evidence that a development impact fee was previously paid and that the building permit has expired, credit for the present value of the development impact fee shall be in the amount of the development impact fee paid, inflated from the date of payments using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent), and shall be applied against that parcel of land. Should the development impact fee be less than the amount credited under the circumstances previously mentioned herein, the excess credit shall remain with the town. Should the development impact fee be greater than the amount credited, under the circumstances previously mentioned, the developer shall pay the difference to the town. 
(e)  In the event that a developer enters into an agreement with the town to construct, fund or contribute system improvements such that the amount of credit created by such construction, funding or contribution exceeds the development impact fee calculated for the project, the developer shall be compensated for such excess contribution by the town or, at the town's option, from development impact fees paid by other developments located in the service area benefited by such improvements. 
(f)  The present value of any such construction or contribution shall be established by: 
(1)  Use of documented prices actually paid by the developer for the system improvements with such prices inflated by use of the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent); 
(2)  Use of documented prices which would have been paid by the town for such system improvements with such prices inflated by use of the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent), whichever is less. 
The town is under no obligation to make immediate compensation, but will make compensation if funds are available. 
(g)  Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, no credits shall be given for construction, contribution or dedication of any system improvement or funds for system improvements made before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this article nor shall credit be given for system improvements or funds for system improvements constructed, contributed or dedicated after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this article if an agreement to do so was entered into before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this article for projects which have already received a building permit. 
(h)  In the event that a feepayor has, under previously established conditions of zoning, constructed, contributed or dedicated system improvements or funds when receiving permits to proceed with only a portion or phase of a project as defined by a particular zoning case, where the construction, contribution or dedication is in excess of that required by the portion or phase permitted, the excess construction, contribution or dedication shall be credited against future development impact fees which shall be required as additional portions or phases of the zoned projects seeking building permits. 
(i)  The developer must present adequate evidence of the cost and age of the improvement from which present value may be calculated using the Bloomberg AAA GO Municipal Bond Yield Index (or equivalent) estimates of inflation and depreciation. 
(j)  Credits required under subsection (b) of this section shall be automatically given at the time of fee imposition. Any other credits shall be given only upon request by the developer to the town administrator. To receive consideration for such other credits, a developer must present adequate evidence or proposals for creditable activities and adequate evidence of value to the town administrator at or before the time of application for a building permit. 
(k)  The town administrator shall review all claims for allowance and valuation of credits and make determinations regarding: 
(1)  Allowance of any claimed credit; 
(2)  Value of any allowed credit. 
(l)  Any credits shall be acknowledged in writing and calculated at the time of imposition of the development impact fee. A developer may appeal any such determination by following the guidelines established in section 101-62 (Appeals).

Chapter 105 - ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 105-1. - Wetlands Protection District. 
(a)  Purpose. 
(1)  The wetlands in the town are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality, maintenance and pollution control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; and open space and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the state. 
(2)  Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
(3)  The purpose of this section is to promote wetlands protection, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined through a permitting process. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Generalized wetlands map means the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps for the Town of Tyrone, Georgia. 
Jurisdictional wetland means an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344, as amended. 
Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to, result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act. 
Wetlands means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrological conditions that involve a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. 
(c)  Establishment of the wetlands protection district. 
(1)  The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the town that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps. This map shall be referred to as the "generalized wetlands map" and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this section, together with all explanatory matter thereon and attached thereto. 
(2)  The generalized wetlands map does not represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the town and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this section does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
(d)  Protection criteria; requirement for local permit or permission. No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit from the town. If the area proposed for development is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the [building official or authorized local government representative] using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the local permit or permission will not be granted until a section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued. 
(e)  Permitted uses. The following uses shall be allowed as of right within the wetlands protection district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law, including laws of trespass, and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining, or dredging except as provided herein. The activities listed in this section are exempted from section 404 regulations, provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual permit 404 permit. However, under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances: 
(1)  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish and other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would required an individual 404 permit. 
(2)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding, and canoeing. 
(3)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission and as specified in section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
(4)  The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
(5)  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed, and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
(6)  Education, scientific research, and nature trails. 
(f)  Prohibited uses. The following uses are not permitted within the wetlands protection district: 
(1)  Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants; 
(2)  Hazardous or sanitary waste landfills; 
(3)  Any other uses either not otherwise specifically permitted or allowed under other provisions of the zoning ordinance or the development standards of the town. 
(g)  Administration and enforcement procedures. 
(1)  Site plans. Application for a local development permit within the wetlands protection district shall include a site plan, drawn at a scale of one inch equals 50 feet, with the following information: 
a.  A map of all planned excavation and fill including calculations of the volume of cut and fill involved and cross-sectional drawings showing existing and proposed grades. Elevations, horizontal scale and vertical scale must be shown on the cross-sectional drawings. 
b.  A map of any wetland boundaries occurring within the site must be provided. This boundary may be included on other maps provided by the applicant. 
c.  Location, dimensions and area of all impervious surfaces, both existing and proposed, on the site and adjacent to the site for a distance of 200 feet. 
d.  The orientation and distance from the boundaries of the proposed site to the nearest bank of an affected perennial stream or water body. 
e.  Elevations of the site and adjacent lands within 200 feet of the site at contour intervals of no greater than two feet, and no greater than one foot for slopes less than or equal to two percent. 
f.  Location and detailed design of any spill and leak collection systems designed for the purpose of containing accidentally released hazardous or toxic materials. 
g.  All proposed temporary disruptions or diversions of local hydrology. 
(2)  Activities to comply with site plan. All development activities or site work conducted after approval of the site plan shall conform with the specification of said site plan. Significant changes to the site plan that would alter the amount and velocity of stormwater runoff from the site, increase the amount of impervious surface within the development, alter the overall density of development, or result in a considerable increase in the amount of excavation, fill or removal of the overall appearance of the development as proposed can be amended only with the approval of the building official or designated appointee. Minor changes, such as the realignment of streets or minor alterations to drainage structure and other infrastructure to meet unexpected conditions, are exempted from this requirement. 
(3)  Exemption to site plan requirements. The following activities and developments are exempt from the requirement for detailed site plans: 
a.  Single-family detached homes constructed within a subdivision of fewer than five parcels. 
b.  Repairs to a facility that is part of a previously approved and permitted development. 
c.  Construction of minor structures, such as sheds or additions to single-family residences. 
(4)  Review procedures. The application shall be made to the town manager (or the town manager's designee; hereinafter the term "town manager" shall include any designee) and will be reviewed within 15 days. At the time of the application, the applicant shall pay a filing fee as specified by the town. Filing fees up to the larger of $500.00 or $100.00 per acre may be required to evaluate the application. This fee may be used to retain expert consultants who will provide services pertaining to functional assessment, mitigation, and wetland boundary determinations, as deemed necessary by the town manager. The review period shall include the preparation of findings (approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval) by the town manager. The applicant will receive written notification of the findings of the town manager. If the review process is not completed within 30 days, the application is considered to be approved. Decisions of the town manager may be appealed to the mayor and town council.

Sec. 105-2. - Water Supply Watershed Protection District. 
(a)  Purpose. 
(1)  In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the town and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land-disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxins, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport, and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
(2)  The purpose of this section is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the town, to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply, and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This section shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the town. 
(b)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this subsection, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Buffer means a natural or enhanced vegetated area with no or limited minor land-disturbances, such as trails and picnic areas, located adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed. 
Corridor means all land within the buffer areas established adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed and within other setback areas specified in subsection (d) of this section. 
Impervious surface means a manmade structure or surface that prevents the infiltration of stormwater into the ground below the structure or surface. Examples are buildings, roads, driveways, parking lots, decks, swimming pools, or patios. 
Large water supply watershed means a watershed containing 100 square miles or more of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake. 
Perennial stream means a stream that flows throughout the whole year as indicated on a U.S. Geodetic Survey quad map. 
Reservoir boundary means the edge of a water supply reservoir defined by its normal pool level. 
Small water supply watershed means a watershed that contains less than 100 square miles of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake. 
Utility means public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems and railroads or other utilities identified by a local government. 
Water supply reservoir means a governmentally owned impoundment of water for the primary purpose of providing water to one or more governmentally owned public drinking water systems. This excludes the multipurpose reservoirs owned by the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers.

ARTICLE II. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION 

Sec. 105-23. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
Groundwater recharge area (synonymous with aquifer recharge area) means an area of the earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground, thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer. 
Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities. 
Pollution susceptibility maps means maps prepared by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by DNR in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 edition). Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of "karst" topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks), and potentiometric surfaces. 
(Code 1984, § 6-4-202; Ord. No. 379, 6-4-2001) 
Sec. 105-24. - Judicial review. 
(a)  Jurisdiction. All final decisions of the town council concerning denial, approval or conditional approval of development plans, building permits, or cease and desist orders may be reviewable in the county superior court, but only after exhaustion of the administrative remedies provided. 
(b)  Alternative actions. Based upon judicial proceedings or the decision of the court, the town council may: 
(1)  Institute negotiations to settle or compromise the pending judicial proceedings; 
(2)  Approve the development plan application with lesser restrictions or conditions; or 
(3)  Institute other appropriate actions ordered by the court that fall within the jurisdiction of the town. 
(Code 1984, § 6-4-206; Ord. No. 379, 6-4-2001) 
Sec. 105-25. - Title, findings and objectives. 
(a)  Title of article. This article shall be known as the "Groundwater Recharge Area Protection Ordinance of the Town of Tyrone, Georgia." 
(b)  Finding of fact. 
(1)  In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the town, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. For this reason, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the town relies on as a source of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers, which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. 
(2)  Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. It is, therefore, necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
(c)  Objectives. The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
(2)  Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and 
(3)  Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality.

State Law reference— Similar provisions, O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17. 
Sec. 105-57. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions of this section shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in this subsection (b) and subsection (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or issuing authority or to any other allegation of noncompliance with subsection (b)(2) of this section, or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this subsection, the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by the local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This subsection (b)(2) shall not apply to any land-disturbance associated with the construction of single-family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land-disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16) of this section, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit, and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection (c)(9), a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent properties and waters beyond the levels specified in this section; 
(15)  Except as provided in subsection (16) of this section, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented, or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of article 5, chapter 5 of title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection (15). The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; they cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to article 2 of chapter 5 of title 12, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent an issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Base flow means the discharge that enters a stream channel mainly from groundwater, but also from lakes during periods when no precipitation occurs. 
Buffer means, with respect to a stream, a natural or enhanced vegetated area (established by section 105-88), lying adjacent to the stream. 
Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding, which would have at least a one percent probability of flooding occurrence in any calendar year based on the basin being fully developed as shown on the current land use plan, i.e., the regulatory flood. 
Impervious cover means any manmade paved, hardened or structural surface regardless of material. The term "impervious cover" includes but is not limited to rooftops, buildings, streets, roads, decks, swimming pools, any concrete or asphalt including concrete or asphalt trails or walkways. 
Intermittent stream means a stream that flows in a well-defined channel during wet seasons of the year, but not for the entire year. 
Intrusions means land development activities within the setback not otherwise authorized by this article. 
Land development means any land change, including but not limited to clearing, grubbing, stripping, removal of vegetation, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land, construction, paving and any other installation of impervious cover.

Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
Riparian means belonging or related to the bank of a river, stream, lake, pond or impoundment. 
Setback means, with respect to a stream, the area established by section 105-88 extending beyond any buffer applicable to the stream. 
Stream means any stream, beginning at: 
(1)  The location of a spring, seep, or groundwater outflow that sustains stream flow; or 
(2)  A point in the stream channel with a drainage area of 25 acres or more; or 
where evidence indicates the presence of a stream in a drainage area of other than 25 acres, the town may require field studies to verify the existence of a stream. 
Stream bank means the sloping land that contains the stream channel and the normal flows of the stream. 
Stream channel means the portion of a watercourse that contains the base flow of the stream. 
Watershed means the land area that drains into a particular stream. 
(Ord. No. 504, § 1(6-10-3), 6-7-2007) 
Sec. 105-86. - Violations, enforcement and penalties. 
Any action or inaction which violates the provisions of this article or the requirements of an approved site plan or permit may be subject to the enforcement actions outlined in this section.

(8)  Providing tree canopy to shade streams and promote desirable aquatic habitat; 
(9)  Providing riparian wildlife habitat; 
(10)  Furnishing scenic value and recreational opportunity; and 
(11)  Providing opportunities for the protection and restoration of greenspace. 
(Ord. No. 504, § 1(6-10-2), 6-7-2007) 
Sec. 105-88. - Applicability. 
(a)  This article shall apply to all land development activity on property containing a stream protection area as defined in section 105-85. These requirements are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer requirements established under state law, and approval or exemption from these requirements do not constitute approval or exemption from buffer requirements established under state law or from other applicable local, state or federal regulations. 
(1)  Grandfather provisions. This article shall not apply to the following activities: 
a.  Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land that is zoned and approved for such use on or before the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
b.  Existing development and on-going land-disturbance activities including but not limited to existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance, except that new development or land-disturbance activities on such properties will be subject to all applicable buffer requirements. 
c.  Any land development activity that is under construction, fully approved for development, scheduled for permit approval, or has been submitted for approval as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
(2)  Exemptions. The following specific activities are exempt from this article. Exemption of these activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property. 
a.  Activities for the purpose of building one of the following: 
1.  A stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route or utility line; 
2.  Public water supply intake or public wastewater outfall structures; 
3.  Intrusions necessary to provide access to a property; 
4.  Public access facilities that must be on the water including boat ramps, docks, foot trails leading directly to the river, fishing platforms and overlooks; 
5.  Unpaved foot trails and paths; 
6.  Activities to restore and enhance stream bank stability, vegetation, water quality and/or aquatic habitat, so long as native vegetation and bioengineering techniques are used. 
b.  Public sewer line easements paralleling the creek, except that all easements (permanent and construction) and land disturbance should be at least 25 feet from the top of the bank. This includes such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. This exemption shall not be construed as allowing the construction of roads, bike paths or other transportation routes in such easements, regardless of paving material, except for access for the uses specifically exempted above. 
c.  Land development activities within a right-of-way existing at the time this ordinance takes effect or approved under the terms of this article. 
d.  Within an easement of any utility existing at the time the ordinance from which this article is derived takes effect or approved under the terms of this article, land-disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. 
e.  Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report such work to the (review and permitting authority) on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within ten days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the review and permitting authority to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity of the town, stability or water quality of the protection area. 
f.  Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silviculture or agricultural uses and are not incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land-disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer. 
(b)  After the effective date of Ord. No. 504, this article shall apply to new subdividing and platting activities. Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to section 105-92(b). 
(Ord. No. 504, § 1(6-10-4), 6-7-2007) 
Sec. 105-89. - Compatibility with other buffer regulations and requirements. 
(a)  This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. The requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence. 
(b)  Specifically, the town's water supply watershed protection ordinance and wetlands protection district ordinance shall not be repealed by the adoption of this article and the requirements therein shall be in addition to the requirements set forth in this article. 
(Ord. No. 504, § 1(6-10-5), 6-7-2007) 
Sec. 105-90. - Responsibility. 
Neither the issuance of a development permit nor compliance with the conditions thereof or with the provisions of this article shall relieve any person from any responsibility otherwise imposed by law for damage to persons or property; nor shall the issuance of any permit hereunder serve to impose any liability upon the town, its officers or employees for injury or damage to persons or property. 
(Ord. No. 504, § 1(6-10-7), 6-7-2007) 
Sec. 105-91. - Inspection. 
(a)  The town manager or his designee may cause inspections of the work in the buffer or setback to be made periodically during the course thereof and shall make a final inspection following completion of the work. The permittee shall assist the town manager or his designee in making such inspections.

(a)  Buffer and setback requirements. All land development activity subject to this article shall meet the following requirements: 
(1)  An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank. 
(2)  An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback. 
(3)  No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback. 
(b)  Variance procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
(1)  Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the town manager or his designee finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the mayor and town council of the town may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance requires mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
(2)  Except as provided above, the mayor and town council of the town shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the mayor and town council shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the town. The town shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. 
(3)  Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
a.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
b.  Unusual circumstances where strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the article would create an extreme hardship. 
(4)  Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
(5)  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
a.  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
b.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
c.  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
e.  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and 
h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
(6)  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; 
d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
e.  The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance; and 
f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment; 
g.  It is noted that Line Creek and Trickum Creek are of great significance to the county as drinking water sources. Therefore, this factor and its relationship to these two streams will be considered in all requests as to whether to grant a variance along either of these two streams. 
(Ord. No. 504, § 1(6-10-4), 6-7-2007) 
Sec. 105-93. - Administrative appeal and judicial review.

Specimen tree or stand means any tree or grouping of trees, which qualifies as being of high value because of its size, species, age, location or historical character. Designation of such trees may be initiated by the town manager, upon application by the zoning administrator or any other interested person. Such designation may occur only by resolution of the council. The zoning administrator shall maintain and file with the town clerk a complete listing of the location and identifying features of all specimen trees. General criteria for the determination of specimen trees are: 
(1)  Any deciduous tree with a diameter of 30 inches or greater. 
(2)  Any coniferous tree with a diameter of 24 inches or greater.

Tree bank means an account of funds, maintained by the administration department of the town, contributed by developers as a alternate form of compliance. Funds from the tree bank are to be used solely for the purchase and planting of trees on public sites within the town as authorized by the town manager. 
Tree destruction means any intentional or negligent act which will cause a tree to die within a period of two years, including but not limited to cutting or otherwise damaging the trunk, tools or other vital sections of the tree damage inflicted upon the root system of a tree by the application of toxic substances, damage caused by the operation of heavy machinery or change or natural grade by excavation or filling of the cover. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A), 5-1-2002) 
Sec. 105-120. - Violation and penalty. 
Any person, firm or corporation violating a provision of this article shall be deemed guilty of an offense. As a condition of suspension of any fine or sentence, the court may require payment of restitution or impose other punishment allowed by law which may include mandatory attendance at an educational program concerning tree preservation. Each day's continuance of a violation may be considered a separate offense. Each tree cut, damaged or poisoned shall constitute a separate offense. The owner of any property wherein a violation exists, and any architect, developer, builder, contractor, tenant or agent who commits or may have assisted in the commission of any such violation shall be guilty of a separate offense. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-032), 5-1-2002) 
Sec. 105-121. - Purpose. 
(a)  The guiding presumption behind this article is the belief that the natural environment has significant value in and of itself, and that all reasonable measures available should be used in the preservation of that environment, consistent with the continued development of a viable town. The purpose of this article is to promote the preservation of existing tree canopy and tree specimen diversity within the town and preserve the aesthetic quality of land during and after development. Such preservation shall protect and enhance the town's urban greenery through tree protection and planting of trees and landscaping during land development of all property, public and private. Benefits associated with these regulations are reduced soil erosion, stormwater management costs and flooding potential; moderation of microclimates; improved air and water quality; mitigation of noise and glare; energy conservation through reduced heating and cooling costs; and enhanced property values. These benefits are heightened by the scenic and psychological values associated with the tree cover and are consistent with the town's emphasis on rural character. 
(b)  The town council, therefore, declares it to be public policy to: 
(1)  Aid in stabilizing the environment's ecological balance by contributing to the process of air purification, oxygen regeneration, groundwater recharge, and stormwater runoff retardation, while at the same time aiding in noise, glare, and heat abatement; 
(2)  Assist in providing adequate light and air by preventing overcrowding of land; 
(3)  Provide visual buffering and enhance beautification of the town; 
(4)  Safeguard and attempt to enhance property values and, in so doing, protect private and public investment, 
(5)  Preserve, protect and further the unique identity and environment of the town, and, thereby, preserve the economic base attracted to the town by such factors; 
(6)  Recognize that the protection and enhancement of the natural beauty, environment, and greenspace within the town contributes to the economy, as well as provide a truly necessary aesthetic balance to the development of an urban setting; 
(7)  Conserve an ever-dwindling supply of energy, by the preservation and enhancement of the natural environment; 
(8)  Protect the atmosphere, lands, and water from pollution, impairment or unnecessary destruction; 
(9)  Protect natural vegetation except where its removal is necessary for responsible property development or control of disease and infestation. This article shall serve to dissuade the unnecessary clearing of land and its disturbance, so as to preserve, insofar as possible, the natural and existing growth of vegetation, and to replace whenever possible the removed foliage with new vegetation; 
(10)  Protect vegetation within the intermediate regional floodplain and for a minimum of ten feet from the banks of those streams not having defined intermediate regional floodplain elevation contours, so as to assist in the retention of stormwater runoff and the control of erosion, including particularly the protection of stream bank stability by vegetation protection or restoration; 
(11)  Preserve protected and "specimen" trees or stands of trees which are exceptional representatives of their species either in terms of size, age or unusual botanical quality, and encourage the good care of same through properly applied forestry practices; 
(12)  Protect and supplement existing vegetation within greenbelts, open space, recreation areas and protected area where feasible; 
(13)  Establish and maintain the maximum amount of tree cover on public and private property in the town by prohibiting destruction and removal of trees except in accordance with standards herein set forth as well as requiring the planting of trees on all development sites to achieve a specified minimum tree cove; 
(14)  Maintain trees in the town in a healthy and nonhazardous condition through adoption and enforcement of professional arboricultural practices; 
(15)  Establish, and revise as necessary, standards for planting and maintaining trees designed to improve the town's economic base by improving property values, enhancing the town's visual quality and its neighborhoods, and improving public health by reducing air pollution and the incidence of flooding; 
(16)  Structure a tree density calculation method that favors the preservation of existing trees as opposed to replanting with smaller nursery stock; and 
(17)  Strongly encourage the use of native plant materials to preserve the heritage of the town's natural beauty and promote best practices for water usage.

(1)  Pre-construction inspection. Prior to issuance of a permit for clearing, grubbing and grading, site development or road construction, the town engineer shall inspect all tree inspection devices for compliance with the approved plans. Failure to adhere to this article will subject the owner and/or developer to enforcement procedures provided in this article. 
(2)  Construction inspection. During construction, the town engineer will periodically inspect all projects to assure the adequacy of tree protection fencing. Failure to adhere to town standards for tree protection shall constitute ordinance noncompliance and shall subject the owner and/or developer to enforcement procedures provided in the tree preservation regulations. 
(3)  Final inspection. 
a.  Prior to the release of the project for final platting or certificate of occupancy, or other form of acceptance by the town, the town engineer shall inspect the project for compliance with all requirements of this article. Any disturbances in tree save areas or deficiencies in the required site density standard will be sited at this time. Tree save area disturbances and/or site density standard deficiencies must be corrected with new tree plantings prior to project release. 
b.  Existing trees which are not expected to survive will not be credited toward fulfilling site density standards. Conversely, any existing trees not shown to remain on plans but which have been preserved (meeting all tree preservation standards) through field adjustments, may be so credited, provided that all such adjustments are properly recorded on the approved plans on file at town hall. 
(4)  Maintenance inspection. 
a.  One full growing season following the date if inspection of newly-planted trees, the town engineer shall inspect all trees on the project site. Any trees planted to meet the required site density standard which are dead, or nearly dead, shall be replaced. Trees preserved to meet the required site density which are dead, or nearly dead, shall be replaced whenever the loss of such trees due to construction-related injury is evident. The owner of the project or property at the time of the maintenance inspection shall be responsible for compliance with this article. 
b.  Trees used to fulfill site density standards of this article shall be maintained for two years following the date of final approval of the project. The property owner shall maintain the required site density.

c.  Any trees required to be replaced as a result of this inspection shall be planted within 30 days of receipt of notification by the current owner. New tree plantings may be postponed for up to six months by posting of a performance bond in the amount of 110 percent of the planting cost. Failure to plant new trees in accordance with the provisions of this article will constitute ordinance noncompliance, and may subject the owner to civil penalties. 
(5)  Issuance of certificate of occupancy. 
a.  All trees used to fulfill the site density standard shall be planted prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy (C.O.). 
b.  Upon final installation of newly planted trees in compliance with this article, and following acceptance by the town manager, the owner shall warrant the new trees and provide for the replacement of those that do not survive for a minimum period of two years. 
c.  In the event that new trees proposed to be planted to achieve that site density standard are not installed upon application for a certificate of occupancy or final plat approval, as appropriate, a performance bond or other acceptable surety in an amount equal to 110 percent of the value of the new trees and their installation shall be posted in accordance with performance bonding requirements. The term of the bond shall not exceed one year. 
d.  An inspection of all tree plantings shall be made by the town engineer to assure compliance with plan requirements prior to release of the performance bond. The bond shall be drawn upon by the town at the time of expiration should any approved plan requirements not be fulfilled and the owner has not requested an extension. One six-month extension is permitted with documented justification. Any inspections performed after the final inspection for project release are subject to reinspection fee schedules. 
(6)  Restoration of disturbed tree save areas. Once a tree save area has been established through the plan approval process set forth in this article, any destruction of trees in that area must be remedied by planting new trees to restore the required site density or to achieve the intended effect of the buffer, as appropriate. 
(7)  Remedial care. Trees in tree save areas which have been adversely impacted by construction activities may be subject to remedial care. Remedial care will be performed at the discretion of town manager, and may include, but not be limited to, the following actions: 
a.  Tree pruning. 
b.  Soil aeration. 
c.  Fertilization. 
d.  Supplemental watering. 
(8)  Appeals. Any person adversely affected by a decision of the town manager, town engineer or zoning administrator in the enforcement or interpretation of any of the terms or provisions of this article may appeal the decision to the planning commission. Such appeal shall be made by filing written notice thereof with the zoning administrator within a maximum of ten business days following the decision being appealed. 
(9)  Administrative variances. Front, side and rear yard seatbacks may be reduced by an amount not to exceed 50 percent where it is determined by the town manager to be necessary in order to preserve existing specimen or other significant trees. Appropriate conditions to said administrative variances shall be imposed so as to ensure the continued health of said trees following the granting of such variances, including mandatory replacement requirements. Such administrative variances shall be considered and decided consistent with the procedures and criteria contained in this article. Appeals of final decisions regarding administrative variances may be made to the planning commission.

(c)  A landscape plan shall include one canopy tree with a minimum trunk caliper of 2½ inches (at four inches from the ground) for every 1,000 square feet of permanently disturbed area on the site. An area is considered permanently disturbed if it is covered with a building, structure, or other impervious surfaces like walks, drives and patios. 
(d)  A landscape plan shall include one understory tree with a minimum trunk caliper of one inch (at four inches from the ground) for every 1,000 square feet of permanently disturbed area on the site. 
(e)  All required landscaping shall be maintained in a horticulturally healthy and aesthetically pleasing manner. 
(f)  It is recommended that no new planting should be more than 100 feet from a watering source; however, it is required that assurances acceptable to the town will be provided that water will be available and appropriate watering will take place. 
(g)  All landscape areas within parking lots shall be 100 percent landscaped with deciduous trees, shrubs, ground cover (not requiring mowing), and/or flowers in mulched beds. 
(h)  Landscaped areas within and around parking lots must be large enough to provide for health and continued growth of the vegetation. 
(i)  Landscaping shall not obstruct the view between 24 inches high and 60 inches high on access drives, streets or parking aisles. 
(j)  The perimeter of all parking areas shall be landscaped. Parking areas designed to accommodate no more than 20 automobiles are not required to install interior landscapes areas like islands, peninsulas, and medians. Parking areas designed to accommodate more than 20 automobiles must install interior landscaped areas so that no more than 12 adjacent parking spaces exist without a landscaped separation of at least five feet in width. If significant tree save areas or natural areas exist within a parking area, the town may make an exception to this requirement as appropriate. 
(k)  Screening shall be used as a buffer between incompatible uses, and to reduce the effects of headlight glare, noise and other objectionable activities. The following minimum requirements shall apply to screening: 
(1)  All vegetation used for screening shall be at least three feet in height at time of installation. Plants shall be spaced as to provide for effective visual screening within three growing seasons. Planting beds required for screening shall be a minimum of six feet in width. 
(2)  Screening may consist of a fence, a wall, or vegetation and/or a mix of any or all of the foregoing. The outer or public side of fences and walls shall be landscaped enough to soften the structure with a tree or shrub group at least every 50 feet, subject to approval of the town council. 
(3)  Screening shall be installed on all lot lines where commercial, industrial, and institutional uses abut residential zoning districts except for entrances or exits. 
(4)  No screening shall be removed without the written permission of the town.

(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-011), 5-1-2002) 
Sec. 105-252. - Determination of specimen trees or stands of trees; density credit. 
(a)  Criteria. Specimen trees are characterized by the following minimum standards: 
(1)  Any tree equaling or exceeding the following diameter sizes: 
a.  24-inch dbh: large hardwoods such as beech, oaks, hickories, yellow poplars, etc. 
b.  30-inch dbh: large softwoods such as cedars, pines, spruces, etc. 
(2)  Trees not fully conforming to these sizes may be considered specimen trees in the case of a rare or unusual species, trees of exceptional aesthetic or unique quality, or trees of historical significance. Such trees may also be considered specimen trees when specifically used by a builder, developer or design professional as a focal point in a landscape design. 
(3)  Specimen trees are also characterized as any tree in fair or better condition, as determined by the town manager or state forestry commission representative, meeting the following standards: 
a.  A life expectancy of over 15 years. 
b.  A structurally sound trunk, not hollow and having no extensive decay that exceeds 20 percent radial trunk dieback. 
c.  No more than one major or several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only). 
d.  No major insect or pathological problem. 
(b)  Specimen tree stands. A contiguous grouping of trees that have been determined to be of high value by the town manager based on the following criteria: 
(1)  A relatively mature even-aged stand. 
(2)  A stand with purity of species composition or of a rare or unusual nature. 
(3)  A stand of historical or cultural significance. 
(4)  A stand with exceptional aesthetic quality. 
(c)  Density credit. In order to encourage the preservation of specimen trees and incorporation of these trees into the project design, additional density credit will be given for successful preservation of specimen trees. Credit assigned for any specimen tree saved will be two times the density unit value shown in section 105-265(d), table 1. Specimen trees shall be verified by the town manager, and shall be located on the tree protection plan. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-012), 5-1-2002) 
Sec. 105-253. - Minimum site density standards. 
(a)  For all areas being developed, except land used for pasture land, a minimum site density of 100 units per acre, exclusive of any acreage within a zoning buffer area and any trees needed to meet buffer requirements as set forth in the zoning ordinance or as conditions of zoning approval, must be maintained on all properties subject to this article. For all areas used as pasture land for the past ten years, a minimum site density of 50 units per acre exclusive of any acreage within a zoning buffer area and any trees needed to meet buffer requirements as set forth in the zoning ordinance or as conditions of zoning approval must be maintained on all properties subject to this article. The term "unit" is an expression of basal area and is not synonymous with "tree." The density standard must be met as a condition of development permits distance whether or not a property contained trees prior to development. Trees, both existing and planted, shall be reasonably distributed throughout the site where feasible, with an emphasis on tree groupings to achieve aesthetic results in conformance with professional landscaping standards. Trees may be planted for credit within a public right-of-way, subject to approval by the town manager. 
(b)  This density may be achieved through credits for preserving existing trees, by planting new trees according to the minimum standards of this article, or through a combination of both. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all reasonable efforts must be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable efforts shall include, but not be limited to, alteration of building design; alternate location of buildings, parking areas and stormwater detention facilities; or relocation of utilities. 
(c)  Minimum site density shall be calculated and established pursuant to the formula and analysis set forth in section 105-265(b). Property owners shall be subject to the minimum site density standard set forth in this section. The density calculation shall be based on the net site area, excluding infrastructure improvements, such as roads, utility easements, detention ponds, etc. In no event, shall off-street parking areas be considered as infrastructure improvement. 
(d)  Site density credits. Credit shall be given for existing trees to be retained which are a minimum diameter of three inches; credit shall be given for trees planted which are a minimum caliper of 2½ caliper inches. Additional credits shall be granted under the following circumstances: A total site density credit, not to exceed twice the normal credit, may be granted by the town manager for existing trees to be retained which have greater value as outstanding specimen trees, trees having historic value or being a rare or unique species. 
(e)  Trees replanted to achieve density standards are to be species selected from the tree species selection list in section 105-266 or as otherwise approved by the town manager. Replanting shall be at a minimum ratio of one canopy tree for every three understory trees. Minimum density may be met by planting all canopy trees; however, such density shall not be met by planting only understory trees. 
(f)  In addition, no more than 40 percent of any one genus may comprise the trees proposed in any replanting plan. 
(g)  Minimum size requirements for replacement trees are contained in section 105-265(e), table 2. 
(h)  Tree planting requirements may be amended by the town manager in cases where minimum site densities are not evenly distributed on the net site area and aesthetic appearances are an issue.

The following guidelines and standards shall apply to trees proposed to be retained for credit toward the minimum density standard: 
(1)  Tree protection areas. Tree root systems are the most critical factor in tree preservation throughout the development process. The root system can easily extend beyond the drip line of the tree canopy. Disturbance of the root system can directly affect a tree's survival. The following guidelines and standards shall apply to trees proposed to be retained for credit toward the minimum site density standard and to protect the critical root zones: 
a.  The root system within the drip line is generally considered to be the critical root zone. To protect these critical root zones, a tree protection area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained. 
b.  The tree protection area shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree canopy as defined by the drip line of the tree or group of trees, collectively. In some instances, an area greater than the drip line area may be required to be designated as a tree protection area as determined by the town manager. 
c.  Layout of the project site utility and grading plans shall avoid disturbance of tree protection areas. Whenever utilities must be installed within a tree protection area and such installation will encroach into the drip line of any tree to be saved, the utility shall be installed by tunneling at a minimum depth of 36 inches. Reasonable efforts shall be made to save as many trees as possible, including avoiding utility routing which would endanger the taproot of certain species. 
d.  Construction site activities such as vehicle or equipment parking, materials storage, concrete washout, burn pit placement, etc., shall be arranged so as to prevent damage to trees within tree protection areas. 
(2)  Protective barriers. 
a.  Prior to any land disturbance, all protective tree barriers shall be installed and maintained until completion of site landscaping. Authorization to remove protective barriers shall be in writing by the town manager or by issuance of a final certificate of occupancy. Inspection of tree protection barriers is required prior to any land disturbance or development activity; the town engineer shall be contacted to schedule an inspection. Signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with tree protection standards are recommended for site entrances. 
b.  Tree fencing shall be a minimum of four feet high, constructed in a post-and-rail configuration. A two-inch by four-inch wooden post and a double one-inch by four-inch wooden rail, painted orange, is recommended. Four-foot orange polyethylene laminar safety fencing is also acceptable (Figure 1). 
c.  Where approved, other forms of tree protection may be utilized to delineate tree save areas which are remote from areas of land disturbance. These areas must be completely surrounded with continuous rope of flagging (heavy mil, a minimum of four inches wide). All such tree protection must be accompanied by "Keep Out" or "Tree Save" signs (Figure 2). 
d.  All tree protection areas must be protected from soil sedimentation intrusion through the use of silt fencing or other acceptable measures placed upslope from tree protection areas. No construction of any structure or improvement or any construction activity shall encroach or place solvents, materials, construction machinery or temporary soil deposits within six feet of the drip line, as defined herein, of any specimen tree or any tree within a tree protection zone. 
e.  All tree protection measures must be maintained throughout land disturbance and construction and shall not be removed until final landscaping is installed. 
(3)  Encroachment. Most trees can tolerate only a small percentage of critical root zone loss. If encroachment is anticipated within the critical root zones of exceptional trees, stands of trees, or otherwise designated tree protective zones, the following preventive measures shall be employed: 
a.  Clearing activities. Roots often fuse and tangle among trees. Tree removal adjacent to tree save areas can cause inadvertent damage to the protected trees. Where possible, it is advisable to cut minimum two-foot trenches (e.g., using a "Ditch Witch") along the limits of land disturbance, so as to cut, rather than tear, roots. Trenching may be required for the protection of exceptional specimen trees. 
b.  Soil compacting. No parking, material storage or traffic shall be permitted within designated tree protective zones. 
c.  Utility installation. The installation of utilities through a protective zone should occur by way of tunneling rather than trenching (Figures 3 and 4). 
d.  Grade changes. A decrease in grade is best accomplished with the use of retaining walls or through terracing (Figure 5). 
e.  Where the town manager has determined that irreparable damage has occurred to trees within tree protective zones, the trees shall be removed and replaced in a manner consistent with this article. 
(4)  Trees to be retained. 
a.  Canopy trees with a drip line area within 20 feet of a proposed structure should be removed and replaced with an appropriate tree species. When such canopy trees are to be saved, special attention shall be given to protection of the drip line area. The state forestry commission should be contacted for technical assistance. 
b.  Where design constraints require placement of paved surfaces within ten feet of the drip line area of a canopy tree, such trees should be removed and replaced with an appropriate tree species. Alternately, the state forestry commission may be contacted to provide technical assistance concerning appropriate precautions that may be used to protect the tree and pavements (Figure 6). 
c.  All reasonable efforts shall be made to save specimen trees. Reasonable effort shall include, but not be limited to, alteration of building design; alternate location of buildings, parking areas and stormwater detention facilities; or relocation of utilities. 
d.  When a choice is available as to which existing trees to save, emphasis shall be given to the preservation of specimen trees, even isolated individual trees, over the retention of other trees. Non-specimen trees, however, should be saved in stands rather than as individual trees scattered over a site. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-015), 5-1-2002) 
Sec. 105-256. - Alternate compliance to site density standard. 
(a)  The intent of this article is to ensure that a minimum site density is maintained on all developed sites. In limited cases, this intent cannot be realized as a particular site will not bear the required density. Two methods of alternate compliance may be acceptable, at the discretion of the town manager. 
(1)  Planting at a location other than the project site; or 
(2)  Contributing to the town tree bank. 
(b)  The following standards have been established for administering these alternative compliance methods: 
(1)  The town manager must review and approve all requests for alternative compliance. In no instance shall more than 50 percent of the required site density be met through alternative compliance. 
(2)  As many trees as can reasonably be expected to survive must be planted on the site proposed for development. 
(3)  No development permit shall be issued unless the town manager has approved the request for alternate compliance and received the necessary documentation and funds. 
(c)  Alternate location. Whenever trees are to be planted at an alternate location, a tree replacement plan, meeting all applicable standards, must be reviewed and approved. The following note must be shown on the approved plan: 
A tree replacement plan addendum for this project shall be submitted to the town manager for the Town of Tyrone a minimum of 30 days prior to requesting a formal inspection. This plan shall include the species, size and location of trees to be planted off-site to conform to site density standards of this article. Release of this project is subject to approval of this plan, as well as verification of the installation of trees. 
(d)  The following conditions apply when a tree is to be removed under the provisions of this article: 
(1)  The town may, with the consent of the property owner, relocate the tree at the town's expense to town-owned property for replanting, either for permanent use at the new location, or for future use on other town property. 
(2)  Credit may be given to the property owner, for each relocated tree as though the tree was proposed to remain on the property, provided the tree is relocated to a site designated by the town at the owner's expense. 
(e)  Town tree bank. As an alternate method of compliance, the town will accept monetary donations to the town tree bank. These donations will be used for the sole purpose of planting trees on public property within the town limits. Methods of calculating contributions to the town tree bank are contained in section 105-267. 
(f)  The town tree bank will be administered by the town manager. A quarterly report shall be submitted to mayor and council indicating monies collected, funds expended, and the species, number, size and location of trees planted. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-016), 5-1-2002) 
Sec. 105-257. - Tree species selection list for replanting. 
A tree species selection list providing recommended canopy and understory tree species for replanting is contained in section 105-266. The town manager shall review all tree replacement plans to ensure tree species selected are appropriate native species. The following species are considered inappropriate and shall not be used to comply with the requirements of this article: 
(1)  Eastern White Pine. 
(2)  Lombardy Poplar. 
(3)  Mimosa. 
(4)  Silver Maple. 
(5)  Spruce. 
(6)  Box Elder. 
(7)  Black Willow. 
(8)  Royal Paulownia. 
(9)  Tree of Heaven. 
(10)  Keyland Cypress. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-017), 5-1-2002) 
Sec. 105-258. - Sequence of tree planting and removal. 
All tree protection devices shall be installed prior to any clearing, grubbing or grading. The town engineer must inspect the installation of tree protection and erosion and sedimentation control devices prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit or other development or construction permit. Tree protection must remain in functioning condition throughout all phases of development. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-018), 5-1-2002) 
Sec. 105-259. - Removal or destruction of trees; permits. 
(a)  Tree removal. Tree removal shall be prohibited in the following circumstances: 
(1)  Soil erosion or runoff problems will result due to topography, soil type, or proximity to floodplain areas, and the removal will substantially and adversely impact the existing soils relative to runoff and/or erosion. Information provided by the town engineer or other environmental specialist may be used by the town manager. 
(2)  Specimen trees are located on site and cannot be adequately protected or replaced. Additionally, removal may be prohibited if reasonable accommodation can be made to alter the proposed project to save specimen trees and such accommodation have not been made. 
(3)  The removal will have a significant, adverse impact on property values of any adjoining property. 
(4)  Specimen trees removed with prior approval from the town manager must be replaced in addition to the minimum site density standard to compensate for their removal. Specimen trees must be replaced in an inch-by-inch basis by species with the potential for comparable size and quality. For example, removal of a 30-inch diameter tree would require replacement with 15 two-inch caliper trees of a comparable species. This tree replacement is in addition to the minimum site density. 
(5)  Any specimen tree removed without the appropriate review and approval of the town manager must be replaced by trees with a total density equal to twice the unit value of the tree removed. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is no evidence of its condition. 
(6)  Removal of specimen trees ten inches or greater in diameter shall be permitted only in conjunction with an approved tree protection plan, an approved tree replacement plan as appropriate, an approved grading plan, and an approved site development plan. 
(b)  Permits required. No person shall directly or indirectly remove or destroy any tree having a diameter of six inches or greater which is located on property subject to the provisions of this article without first obtaining a permit as provided herein. 
(c)  Application for permit. Permits shall be obtained through application in a form prescribed by the zoning administrator. Each application shall include: 
(1)  A written, signed statement citing the necessity for the removal or destruction of any tree; and 
(2)  The criteria set forth in subsection (e) of this section and that the applicant contends are met. 
(d)  Application review. Upon receipt of a complete application, the zoning administrator shall review said application pursuant to the requirements of this article. The zoning administrator shall either approve, deny or approve subject to conditions consistent with this article. An applicant may submit a new application at any time following denial of an application made pursuant to this article. All applications not acted upon within 30 days of the date of receipt of a complete application by the zoning administrator shall be deemed approved. An applicant may appeal the denial of a permit to the planning commission as provided under the town zoning ordinance. 
(e)  Criteria for tree removal or destruction. No permit shall be issued for removal or destruction of any tree unless: 
(1)  A tree replacement plan meeting the requirements of subsection (f) of this section has been approved; 
(2)  All other applicable requirements of this article are met; and 
(3)  One of the following conditions exists: 
a.  The tree is located within the buildable area of the lot and the applicant has concurrently filed an application for a building permit to make improvements otherwise permissible under all applicable ordinances of the town. 
b.  The tree is diseased or injured to the extent that death is imminent within two years, is in imminent danger of falling, is so close to existing or proposed structures as to endanger them, physically interferes with utility services in a manner that cannot be corrected by anything less than destruction or removal of the tree, or creates a hazardous traffic condition. 
(f)  Standards for tree replacement. Each applicant shall, to the maximum extent feasible, minimize the removal of trees from the site. In any request for a permit for tree removal in which the resulting site density present on the site will be less than 100 density units per acre, the zoning administrator shall require replacement such that the average number of trees on the site is equal to not less than 100 density units per acre. Where tree removal is unavoidable, trees replanted shall be an appropriate species mix considered native to the region. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-019), 5-1-2002) 
Sec. 105-260. - Tree topping. 
It shall be unlawful as a normal practice for any person to top any tree. Topping is defined as the severe pruning of limbs to stubs larger than three inches in diameter within the crown of a tree to such an extent as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes, or certain trees under utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical may be exempted from this provision at the discretion of the town manager. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-020), 5-1-2002) 
Sec. 105-261. - Tree harvesting. 
Selective tree harvesting may be permitted upon authorization by the town manager. Permits authorizing tree harvesting shall be in accordance with the following standards: 
(1)  A 75-foot undisturbed buffer shall be provided and maintained along the entire perimeter of the property, including road frontages, except for authorized access crossings. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, no property owner shall be required to preserve an undisturbed buffer that covers more than 25 percent of the total land area of the property, excluding areas inside the 100-year floodplain. In any such case, an alternate buffer width shall be provided, as determined by the planning commission pursuant to its review of the application for a tree harvesting permit. 
(3)  The property shall be required to meet a site density standard of 100 (or 50) units per acre, not including the 75-foot buffer, upon completion of authorized tree harvesting activities. 
(4)  The owner/developer shall utilize the recommended best management practices as established by the state forestry commission. 
(5)  Once tree harvesting takes place in conformity with the regulations of this section, no development of the property within five years shall be permitted that would require either the property to be rezoned or removal of trees preserved under this section. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-023), 5-1-2002) 
Sec. 105-262. - Tree removal and utility or construction companies. 
(a)  All provisions of this article shall apply to any person removing trees on behalf of any other person, including all tree removal companies, utility companies or persons in the business of moving trees or construction. It shall be unlawful for any person or company to remove or cause to be removed any tree, or undertake any work for which a development permit is required pursuant to this article, unless a valid permit thereof is in effect and displayed according to section 105-264. If any such work or removal is performed without the permit being displayed as required, such removal or work shall constitute a violation of this article and shall subject the person or company violating this article to all penalties provided herein. Utility companies may perform emergency work without formal approval; provided, however, that such emergency work is reported in writing to the town manager within three business days following completion of all emergency work. Further, the permit taken by any person, company or utility under this section shall include defined areas of tree cutting and trimming under a single permit. 
(b)  All tree removal companies, utility companies or persons in the business of removing trees or construction shall remove from the site of any trees, stumps, limbs or debris generated by activities allowed through issuance of a permit under this article. 
(c)  All utility companies shall be required to obtain an annual permit issued by the zoning administrator. All applications for an annual permit shall include a list of subcontractors with names, addresses, telephone numbers and town occupational permit numbers. Quarterly work schedules are to be submitted to the town manager indicating the proposed locations and extent of tree work to be performed. 
(d)  All tree trimming and pruning to be performed by public utilities, public agencies, and their subcontractors on trees growing on private or public rights-of-way shall be done according to the National Arborist Association Standards for Pruning of Shade Trees. 
(e)  The routing of all public and private utility easements shall be subject to review and comment by the town engineer. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-026), 5-1-2002) 
Sec. 105-263. - Debris disposal requirements. 
Following any land-disturbing activity, including clearing, grading or logging, all biodegradable debris, including but not limited to tree stumps, trunks, limbs or brush, shall be hauled off site to an appropriate disposal location or chipped to be used as mulch. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-027), 5-1-2002) 
Sec. 105-264. - Display of permit and inspections. 
The applicant shall prominently display the permit issued at the job site. Such permit shall be displayed continuously while trees are being removed or replaced or work performed as authorized on the permit. As a condition for issuance of a permit, the applicant shall agree in writing to entry onto his premises by representatives of the town as designated by the town manager to inspect the permit and activities at any time, and such entry shall be lawful. Failure to allow such entry shall be unlawful and shall constitute a violation of this article. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, § 1-028), 5-1-2002) 
Sec. 105-265. - Density factor analysis. 
(a)  All properties subject to this article must maintain a minimum site density of 100 units per acre. The term "unit" is an expression of basal area, and is not synonymous with "tree." The density requirement must be met as a condition of development permit issuance, whether or not a property contained trees prior to development. This density may be achieved through credits for preserving existing trees, by planting new trees according to the minimum standards of this article, or through a combination of both. 
(b)  The following formula shall apply to Site Density Standard (SDS) analysis: 
SDS=EDF+RDF 
SDS is the minimum site density to be achieved and maintained on all developed sites, 100 units per acre. 
Existing Density Factor (EDF) is the density value or credit of existing trees to be preserved on a site. 
Replacement Density Factor (RDF) is the density value of new trees to be planted on site. 
(c)  The following steps are used to calculate the required tree preservation or replacement density: 
Step 1: Calculate the Site Density Standard (SDS). SDS is calculated by multiplying the number of site acres by 100. 
EXAMPLE: A 2.5-acre site has a SDS of 2.5 × 100 = 250 
Step 2: Calculate the Existing Density Factor (EDF). EDF is determined by converting the diameter of individual, existing trees to site density units as indicated in Table 1 in subsection (d) of this section. These units are then totaled to determine the site EDF. 
EXAMPLE: Seven trees will remain on the 2.5-acre site. This includes four six-inch trees and one eight-inch tree. The following site density units are associated with the trees to be preserved: 

 
The total site density units, 98, is the Existing Density Factor (EDF). 
Step 3: Calculate the Replacement Density Factor (RDF). RDF is determined by subtracting the EDF value from the SDS value. 
EXAMPLE: 250 (SDS) - 98 (EDF) = 152 (RDF) 
Step 4: Calculate a sample plan for achieving the required Replacement Density Factor (RDF). 
Example: Plant eight 2½-inch, nine three-inch, seven four-inch, five five-inch and three six-inch diameter trees as presented below. 

 
(d)  Table 1 below is used to calculate site density for existing trees by diameter. 
TABLE 1. CONVERTING EXISTING TREE DIAMETERS TO SITE DENSITY UNITS 

 
(e)  The density factor credit for each caliper size of replacement (new) tree is shown in Table 2. An identical credit schedule applies to existing trees which are to be transplanted within the site. Such tree relocation is subject to town manager approval. 
TABLE 2 CONVERTING REPLACEMENT TREES TO SITE DENSITY UNITS 

 
(f)  Basis of site density tables. Site density is based on a reservation of 25 percent of the total area of each development site as open space. This is the Atlanta Regional Commission minimum standard for impervious ratios in groundwater recharge areas. It is accepted here as a reasonable standard for minimizing flooding potential and preserving the town's tree canopy. For a two-acre lot, this represents an area of 21,780 square feet. The town zoning ordinance requirement for landscaping is two trees for each 1,000 square feet of permanently disturbed area. The minimum planting size for canopy trees is 2½-inch caliper. This results in 43.56 trees for the 21,780 square foot area. Accordingly, a total of 40 trees in the 2½-inch size class, 100 density units, is the basis of the tree diameter conversion for replacement trees. As this article favors preservation of existing trees, the density credits are substantially skewed in favor of such preservation. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, app. A), 5-1-2002) 
Sec. 105-266. - Tree species selection list. 
(a)  Understory trees. 

 
(b)  Canopy trees. 

 
(Ord. No. 423, § 1(exhibit A, app. B), 5-1-2002) 
Sec. 105-267. - Appendix C, formula for determining contributions to tree bank. 
(a)  Calculations for valuing contributions to the tree bank are based on 2½-inch caliper replacement trees with a value updated semi-annually, and on file with the town clerk, representing the average cost of materials, labor and guarantee for trees planted in the town area. 
Example calculation: To determine the appropriate contribution to the tree bank, calculate the Density Factor Deficient (DFD) or number of density units which cannot be planted on the site. 
Divide the DFD by 2.5 (the density unit value of a 2½-inch caliper replacement tree from Table 1), multiply the result by $200.00 (cost of 2½-inch caliper replacement tree). 
A 2.5-acre site has a required Site Density Standard (SDS) of 250 units (2.5 × 100 = 250). 
(b)  As specified in the approved tree protection plan and tree replacement plan, following development, four six-inch trees, two seven-inch trees and one eight-inch tree will be preserved, totaling 98 site density units (Existing Density Factor). However, due to site limitations, only 120 density units may be planted as replacement trees, the Planted Density Factor (PDF). 
(c)  The Density Factor Deficient (DFD) is determined using the formula: DFD = SDS - (EDF + PDF) 
In this example, DFD = 250 - (98 + 120) = 32 units 
(d)  A total of 32 density units, as calculated using Table 2, must be planted at an alternate location or the developer may elect to contribute the dollar value of these units to the town tree bank. 
(e)  The contribution amount is calculated by dividing the Density Factor Deficient (DFD) by the number of density units credited for a 2½ tree, multiplied by $200.00. 
That is, 32 (DFD) ;div; 2.5 (density units) × 200 (cost per tree) = $2,560.00 
(f)  The dollar amount represents the total developer contribution to the tree bank in lieu of replacement trees planted on site. 
(g)  Site density credits bear a relationship to the cost of planting the respective tree sizes, favoring planting of larger trees, which bears a relationship to survival rate, through a certain size class, as reflected below. The most economical replanting size is four-inch caliper nursery stock.

(Ord. No. 485, § 1(6-10-8), 2-14-2006) 
Sec. 105-300. - Findings and purposes. 
(a)  It is hereby determined that: 
(1)  Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
(2)  Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
(3)  The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
(4)  These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
(5)  Localities in the state are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution. 
(b)  Therefore, the town has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
(Ord. No. 485, § 1(6-10-1), 2-14-2006)

(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
(2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
(3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
(5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the county's greenspace protection plan; 
(6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained and pose no threat to public safety; and 
(7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up. 
(b)  Applicability. This article shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one or more of the following criteria:

(Ord. No. 485, § 1(10-164), 2-14-2006) 
Sec. 105-303. - Post-development stormwater management performance criteria. 
The following performance criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans, unless otherwise provided for in this article: 
(1)  Water quality. All stormwater runoff generated from a site shall be adequately treated before discharge. It will be presumed that a stormwater management system complies with this requirement if: 
a.  It is sized to treat the prescribed water quality treatment volume from the site, as defined in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; 
b.  Appropriate structural stormwater controls or nonstructural practices are selected, designed, constructed or preserved, and maintained according to the specific criteria in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual; and 
c.  Runoff from hotspot land uses and activities identified by the town are adequately treated and addressed through the use of appropriate structural stormwater controls, nonstructural practices and pollution prevention practices. 
(2)  Stream channel protection. Protection of stream channels from bank and bed erosion and degradation shall be provided by using all of the following three approaches: 
a.  Preservation, restoration and/or reforestation (with native vegetation) of the applicable stream buffer. 
b.  24-hour extended detention storage of the one-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the town for sites that discharge directly into larger streams, rivers, wetlands, or lakes, or to a manmade channel or conveyance system where the reduction in these flows will not have an impact on upstream or downstream stream bank or channel integrity. 
c.  Erosion prevention measures such as energy dissipation and velocity control. 
(3)  Overbank flooding protection. Downstream overbank flood and property protection shall be provided by controlling (attenuating) the post-development peak discharge rate to the pre-development rate for the 25-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event. If control of the one-year, 24-hour storm under subsection (2) of this section is exempted, then peak discharge rate attenuation of the two-year through the 25-year return frequency storm event must be provided. This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the town for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
(4)  Extreme flooding protection. Extreme flood and public safety protection shall be provided by controlling and safely conveying the 100-year, 24-hour return frequency storm event such that flooding is not exacerbated. This requirement may be adjusted or waived by the town for sites where the post-development downstream analysis shows that uncontrolled post-development conditions will not increase downstream peak flows, or that meeting the requirement will cause greater peak flow downstream impacts than the uncontrolled post-development conditions. 
(5)  Structural stormwater controls. All structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed using the appropriate criteria from the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. All structural stormwater controls must be designed appropriately to meet their intended function. For other structural stormwater controls not included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, or for which pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies, literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the town before being included in the design of a stormwater management system. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions or land use activities warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the town may impose additional requirements deemed necessary to protect upstream and downstream properties and aquatic resources from damage due to increased volume, frequency, and rate of stormwater runoff or increased nonpoint source pollution loads created on the site in question. Applicants shall consult the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting and locating a structural stormwater control. 
(6)  Stormwater credits for nonstructural measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required under subsection (1) of this section. The applicant may, if approved by the town, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices and reduce the water quality volume requirement. For each potential credit, there is a minimum set of criteria and requirements which identify the conditions or circumstances under which the credit may be applied. The site design practices that qualify for this credit and the criteria and procedures for applying and calculating the credits are included in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
(7)  Drainage system guidelines. Stormwater conveyance facilities, which may include but are not limited to culverts, stormwater drainage pipes, catchbasins, drop inlets, junction boxes, headwalls, gutter, swales, channels, ditches, and energy dissipaters shall be provided when necessary for the protection of public right-of-way and private properties adjoining project sites and/or public rights-of-way. Stormwater conveyance facilities that are designed to carry runoff from more that one parcel, existing or proposed, shall meet the following requirements: 
a.  Methods to calculate stormwater flows shall be in accordance with the stormwater design manual; 
b.  All culverts, pipe systems and open channel flow systems shall be sized in accordance with the stormwater management plan using the methods included in the stormwater design manual; and 
c.  Design and construction of stormwater conveyance facilities shall be in accordance with the criteria and specifications found in the stormwater design manual. 
(8)  Dam design guidelines. Any land-disturbing activity that involves a site which proposes a dam shall comply with the Georgia Safe Dams Act and Rules for Dam Safety as applicable.

Sec. 107-2. - Findings. 
(a)  The mayor and town council have determined that the flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  The mayor and town council have determined that flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality, stream bank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas. 
(c)  The mayor and town council have determined that effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize damage to private property; 
(3)  Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure, such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in floodplains; and 
(4)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public. 
(d)  Article IX, section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section O.C.G.A. § 36-35-23(a) have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and town council do hereby ordain this chapter and establish this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public property. 
(Ord. No. 500, § I(10-181), 5-17-2007) 
Sec. 107-3. - General provisions. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, stream bank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; 
(5)  Limit the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; and 
(6)  Protect the stormwater management, water quality, stream bank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas. 
(b)  Applicability. This article shall be applicable to all areas of special flood hazard within the town. 
(c)  Designation of ordinance administrator. The town manager or his designee is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this chapter.

Sec. 107-28. - Variance procedures. 
The following variance and appeals procedures shall apply to an applicant who has been denied a permit for a development activity, or to an owner or developer who has not applied for a permit because it is clear that the proposed development activity would be inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter. A request for a variance may be submitted by an applicant who has been denied a permit by the town manager or his designee, or by an owner or developer who has not previously applied for a permit for the reasons stated hereinabove. 
(1)  Requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter shall be submitted to the town manager or his designee. All such requests shall be heard and decided in accordance with procedures to be published in writing by the town manager or his designee. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
(2)  Any person adversely affected by any decision of the town manager or his designee shall have the right to appeal such decision to the mayor and town council in accordance with the procedures set out in the town's zoning ordinance. At a minimum, such procedures shall include notice to all affected parties and the opportunity to be heard. 
(3)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the mayor and town council may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county as provided in O.C.G.A. title 5, ch. 4 (O.C.G.A. § 5-4-1 et seq.). 
(4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure; and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(7)  In reviewing such requests, the town manager or his designee and mayor and town council shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
(8)  Conditions for variances. 
a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
1.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
b.  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
c.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
d.  The town manager or his designee shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(9)  Any person requesting a variance shall, from the time of the request until the time the request is acted upon, submit such information and documentation as the town manager or his designee and mayor and town council shall deem necessary to the consideration of the request. 
(10)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the town manager or his designee and the mayor and town council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as they deem necessary or appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this chapter. 
(11)  Variances shall not be issued "after the fact."

Secs. 107-29—107-59. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 107-60. - Standards for development. 
(a)  Definition of floodplain boundaries. 
(1)  Studied "A" zones, as identified in the FIS, shall be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available. 
(2)  For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the future-conditions flood elevations shall be provided by the town manager or his designee. If future-conditions elevation data is not available from the town manager or his designee, then it shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the town manager or his designee. 
(b)  Definition of floodway boundaries. The width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA-approved flood study. For all streams with a drainage area of 100 acres or greater, the regulatory floodway shall be provided by the town manager or his designee. If floodway data is not available from the town manager, then it shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by FEMA and the town manager or his designee. 
(c)  General standards. 
(1)  No development shall be allowed within the future-conditions floodplain that could result in any of the following: 
a.  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
b.  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity; 
c.  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future-conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or 
d.  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
(2)  Any development within the future-conditions floodplain allowed under subsection(a)(1) of this section shall also meet the following conditions: 
a.  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average groundwater table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average groundwater table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future-conditions flood, and either lie within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed or shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
b.  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
c.  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased; 
d.  Verification of no-rise conditions (0.01 foot or less), flood storage volumes, and flow characteristics shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis meeting the requirements of section 107-61(d); 
e.  Public utilities and facilities, such as water, sanitary sewer, gas, and electrical systems, shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate infiltration or contamination from floodwaters; and 
f.  Any significant physical changes to the base flood floodplain shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the town manager or his designee using the community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of construction, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys for a final letter of map revision (LOMR). 
(d)  Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachment. An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways for which the provisions of section 107-61(d) apply. This study shall be prepared by a professional engineer currently registered in the state and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the town manager or his designee prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
(1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
(2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the town manager or his designee. Cross sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood profiles, and future-conditions flood profiles; 
(3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that base flood floodplain and future-conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
(4)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all future-conditions floodplain encroachments. 
(e)  Floodway encroachments. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in subsection (e)(2) of this section; 
(2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
(3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the town manager or his designee until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA and no-rise certification is approved by the town manager or his designee. 
(f)  Maintenance requirements. The property owner shall be responsible for continuing maintenance as may be needed within an altered or relocated portion of a floodplain on his property so that the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity is not diminished. The town manager or his designee may direct the property owner (at no cost to the town) to restore the flood-carrying or flood storage capacity of the floodplain if the owner has not performed maintenance as required by the approved floodplain management plan on file with the town manager.

Drainage means a general term applied to the removal of surface or subsurface water from a given area either by gravity or by pumping, commonly applied herein to surface water. 
Drainage plan means a plan using appropriate and commonly accepted engineering standards which specifies the means for alteration or development of a drainage system, as may be required by the town engineer. 
Drainage system means the surface and subsurface systems for the removal of water from the land, including both the natural elements of streams, marshes, swales and ponds, whether of an intermittent or continuous nature, and the manmade element which includes culverts, ditches, channels, retention facilities and the storm sewer system. 
Driveway means a vehicular access corridor privately owned and maintained. Residential driveways shall not serve more than two single-family residential lots. 
Erosion means the general process whereby earth is moved by flowing surface or subsurface water, wind, or other naturally occurring forces. 
Flood means a temporary rise in the level of rivers, streams and lakes which results in inundation of areas not ordinarily covered by water. 
Flood hazard boundary map means a map issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the report entitled the Flood Insurance Study for the Town of Tyrone and any revisions thereto where the boundaries of the area of special flood hazard have been defined as "zone A." 
Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of a community on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
Flood insurance study means the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, containing flood profiles, as well as the flood boundary flood map and the water surface elevation of the base flood (IRF), without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
Intermediate regional flood (IRF) means a 100-year frequency flood as defined on the flood hazard map which has a probability of occurring once every 100 years or having a one percent chance of occurring each year. 
Lot. 
(1)  The term "lot" means a tract, portion, or parcel of land separated from other tracts, portions, or parcels by description of a subdivision plat of record or survey map or described by metes and bounds, and intended to be used to facilitate transfer of ownership or for building development. 
(2)  For the purposes of this chapter, the term does not include any portion of a dedicated right-of-way. 
Owner means the person in whom is vested the fee ownership, dominion or title of property, by proprietor; this term may also include a tenant, if chargeable under his lease for the maintenance of the property, and any agent of the owner or tenant, including a developer.

Retention facility means a facility which provides for storage of stormwater runoff and controlled release of this runoff during and after a flood or storm. 
Right-of-way means a strip or parcel of land occupied by or intended to be occupied by a street, crosswalk, utility system, water main, sanitary sewer or storm drain sewer main, drainage ditches and watercourses or any other valid public use. The usage of the term "right-of-way" for land platting purposes shall mean that every right-of-way hereafter established and shown on a record or final plat is to be separate and distinct from the lots or parcels adjoining such right-of-way, and not included within the dimensions or areas of such other lots or parcels. Right-of-way intended for streets, crosswalks, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm drains or other use involving maintenance by a public agency, shall be dedicated or deeded to public use by the maker of the plat on which such right-of-way is established. 
Runoff means the portion of precipitation on the land which reaches the drainage system. 
Runoff coefficient means the ratio of runoff to rainfall. 
Sedimentation facility means natural, running water flowing continuously or intermittently in a channel on or below the surface of the ground. 
Street means a way for vehicular traffic whether designated as an avenue, boulevard, road, highway, expressway, lane, alley, or other way, and for the purposes of this division, streets are divided into the following categories: 
(1)  An "arterial street" is intended to provide higher travel speeds between or within communities, or to and from collectors and expressways. Access is controlled so that only community significant land use may have direct access to these streets. 
(2)  A "collector street" connects residential streets to the highway system's major and higher arterials or provides access to nonresidential uses and arterials. Collectors form barriers between neighborhoods and are designed for higher speeds and traffic volumes than are residential streets. Collectors are classified as major collectors and minor collectors: 
a.  The term "major collector" means the primary function is to carry traffic for most major intraurban trips over one mile, particularly during peak hours. These streets provide only limited direct access to adjacent land. This direct access is usually focused on major facilities, shopping centers or other significant traffic generators. Major collectors are usually designed with four travel lanes and may be either divided or undivided. 
b.  The term "minor collector" means the primary function is to carry traffic for short to medium (one-half-mile to one-mile) intraurban trips. These streets receive traffic from residential streets and transmit it to major collectors and arterials. Minor collectors, spaced to relieve excessive traffic volumes on local streets, are commonly designed with two travel lanes. 
(3)  The term "divided street" means any street with a median greater than 100 feet in length separating the travel lanes. A divided street may be a major collector, minor collector, industrial, commercial or residential street. 
(4)  The term "private street" means any parcel of land set aside to provide access to a development and which will not be dedicated or deeded to the town. These streets shall be constructed to standards adopted by the town.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 111-31. - Nonconforming signs. 
(a)  Nonconforming existing signs. A freestanding or wall sign for which a sign permit was issued which was in existence on May 21, 2009, or which was constructed in accordance with the ordinances and other applicable laws in effect on the date of its construction, but which by reason of its size, height, location, design or construction is not in conformance with the requirements of this chapter, shall be considered a nonconforming sign. Such a sign shall be allowed to remain in place and be maintained (provided that no action is taken which increases the degree or extent of the nonconformity) until there is a change of business name (single business), a change of complex name (multi-business), or the sign and/or supporting structure is totally destroyed as a result of vandalism or any act of the owner or any person acting on behalf of the owner. In the case of a change of ownership where the business name and existing signage (face and structure) remain the same, said sign shall be allowed to remain in place. 
(b)  Lapse of nonconforming sign permit. A nonconforming sign permit shall lapse and become void under the same circumstances as those under which any other sign permit may lapse and become void.

If a sign is deemed to be in need of repair, the owner shall have ten days from the date of written notice from the town in which to repair or remove such sign. Missing letters from a raised letter or changeable copy sign, peeling paint from a painted sign, burned out/inoperative light emitting devices, etc., shall constitute a need for repair. 
(Ord. No. 2009-006, § 1(6-6-13), 5-21-2009) 
Sec. 111-33. - Removal of unlawful or dangerous signs. 
(a)  Removal. The town may order the removal of any sign in violation of this chapter by written notice to the permit holder; or, if there is no permit holder, then to the owner of the sign; or, if the sign owner cannot be found or cannot be determined, then to the sign erector and any party that procured the erection of the sign. If a permit has been issued, such notice shall operate to revoke the permit. 
(b)  Procedure following removal order. If the sign is not removed within 14 days after the order of removal (or 14 days after the date any appeal becomes final), the town shall remove or cause to be removed the sign and to collect the costs thereof as provided below. 
(c)  Removal without notice. The town shall remove any sign in violation of this chapter, without giving notice to any party, if: 
(1)  Said sign is upon the public right-of-way or upon other public property; or

The CMU District will allow innovative and creative design and promote high standards in the development layout to alleviate incompatibility between the internal uses in the development, to limit the expenditure of public funds, and to protect public safety to the greatest degree possible. 
(b)  Requirements for a community mixed-use district. 
(1)  No property may be rezoned to the CMU district without the concurrent approval of a development plan by the town council following public review and recommendation by town staff and the planning commission. All property rezoned and developed pursuant to a single development plan shall be referred to herein as a "CMU Development". 
(2)  The boundaries of each CMU Development shall be as shown on the zoning map and shall correspond with the adopted development plan. 
(3)  The minimum size for a CMU development is 40 acres.

(Revised March 6, 2014) 
Sec. 113-192. - Telecommunications antennas and towers. 
(a)  Purpose and intent . The purpose of this section is to establish minimum development standards for the regulation of commercial telecommunications transmission towers, including but not limited to, cellular and personal communications systems (PCS) towers, broadcasting towers, two-way radio towers, fixed-point microwave dishes, commercial satellites and receiving dishes, and related accessory equipment and buildings. The intent of this section is to: (1) to implement the provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 on a local level; (2) to control placement of towers and antennas in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact to nearby properties by locating towers and antennas in non-residential areas or in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; and (3) to advocate the shared use of new and existing tower sites through co-location thereby discouraging the proliferation of towers throughout the Town of Tyrone. 
(b)  Applicability : 
(1)  District height limitations . The requirements set forth shall govern the location of towers that exceed, and antennas that are installed at a height in excess of the height limitations specified for each zoning district. The height limitations applicable to buildings and structures shall not apply to towers and antennas. 
(2)  Public property . Antennas and towers located on public property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the governing authority shall be exempt from the requirements of this section, provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the governing authority. 
(3)  Amateur radio receive-only antennas . This section shall not govern any amateur radio tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is under 70 feet in height and is owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator or is used exclusively for receive-only antennas; 
(4)  Pre-existing towers and antennas : 
a.  Any tower or antenna previously permitted or currently in use on the effective date of this section shall not be required to meet the requirements of this section, other than the requirements of subsections (c)(5) and (c)(6) herein. Any such tower or antenna shall be referred to in this section as "pre-existing tower" or "pre-existing antenna"; 
b.  Pre-existing towers or antennas that are not in use for a continuous period of 12 months shall be removed per subsection (g) herein. An annual "tower in use certification" shall be required per subsection (g) as well; 
c.  Where a pre-existing tower does not comply with the setback requirements of this section, co-location of antennas on such a tower may occur, provided that any proposed accessory equipment buildings placed within the existing fenced area meet the minimum setbacks of this section and that the height of the pre-existing tower is not increased by the proposed antenna. All other requirements of this section shall apply; 
(5)  Existing tower replacement . Replacement of an existing tower structure is permitted provided that all of the following apply: 
a.  The replacement tower is constructed on a site within close proximity to the existing tower at the same or greater setbacks than previously established; 
b.  The replacement tower complies with the height requirements for the area in which it is located; 
c.  The tower being replaced is removed from site within 15 calendar days from the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the new tower; 
d.  Additional co-location opportunities on the new tower are made available with the minimum users required based on tower height; 
e.  Proposed accessory equipment buildings comply with established setbacks for existing tower facilities without increasing nonconformity; and 
f.  A site plan for the new tower facilities is administratively approved. 
(c)  General guidelines : 
(1)  Principal or accessory use . Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses. The entire tower facility shall count as one principal or accessory use. A different existing use or an existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot; 
(2)  Inventory of existing or planned tower sites . Each applicant for a new tower shall provide an inventory of all existing or planned tower sites in the town and within one-quarter mile of the border thereof. The zoning administrator may share such information with other applicants applying for approval under this section or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the town; provided, however, that the zoning administrator is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available and/or suitable; 
(3)  Availability of suitable existing towers or structures for co-location . No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the town that no existing tower, nor any towers in the approval process, can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. All evidence shall be signed and sealed by appropriate licensed professionals or qualified industry experts. An existing or planned tower would not be suitable for co-location for the following reasons: 
a.  No existing towers or structures located within the geographic area meet the applicant's engineering requirements, including, but not limited to, sufficient height, structural support strength, or electromagnetic interference with antenna(s) on the existing towers or structures; 
b.  The fees or costs required to co-locate on an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for co-location are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed unreasonable. The applicant shall submit in writing a detailed estimate of total development costs; 
c.  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable; or 
d.  Letters of rejection have been received for requests to co-locate on all existing and planned towers within the service area of the proposed tower. 
(4)  Site plan . Applicants shall submit a scaled site plan. Additional information must include maximum effective radiated power, tower height requirements, tower structure standards, access, landscaping, buffers, and other information necessary to assess compliance with this section. Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, shall be certified by a licensed professional engineer. Site plan submittal shall include completion of a tower application, signed and notarized by both the property owner and the tower company representative/agent; 
(5)  Aesthetics—Lighting . The following guidelines shall govern the aesthetics, installation and lighting of all towers and antennas: 
a.  Towers shall, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. Where possible, towers shall be designed to appear to be trees, or other natural features; 
b.  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and built environment; 
c.  If any antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color and texture of the supporting structure, and if roof-mounted shall be screened by a parapet wall, so as to make the antenna and related equipment visually unobtrusive; 
d.  Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. 
(6)  Federal requirements . All towers must meet current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas, including modulation studies on frequency usage to avoid interference with existing systems in operation. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this section shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall result in appropriate action by the Town of Tyrone. Prior to submittal for an administrative site plan approval, applicants shall be required to submit written approval from the FAA which states that the proposed communications tower does not encroach onto or through any established public or private airport approach path or federal airspace as established by the FAA; 
(7)  Building codes—Safety standards . To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the electronic industries association, as amended from time to time. If upon inspection the governing authority concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 60 days to bring such tower into compliance. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance with such standards appropriate action will be taken by the Town of Tyrone. 
(8)  Application . Any application submitted for approval shall meet all of the guidelines listed above. Failure to meet all required guidelines shall result in denial of said application. All applicants for new tower construction shall include the following information at time of application submittal: site and landscape plans drawn to scale; a report including all tower specifications and a description of the tower with technical reasons for its design; documentation establishing the structural integrity for the tower's proposed uses; the general capacity of the tower and information necessary to assure that ANSI standards are met; a statement of intent on whether excess space will be leased; proof of ownership of the proposed site or authorization to utilize it; and copies of any easements necessary; 
(9)  Streamlined process for modification or co-location of wireless facilities: 
a.  Applications for co-location or modification of a wireless facility entitled to streamlined processing as described below shall be reviewed for conformance with applicable site plan and building permit requirements, including zoning and land use conformity, but shall not otherwise be subject to the issuance of additional zoning, land use, or special use permit approvals beyond the initial zoning, land use, or special permit approvals issued for such wireless support structure or wireless facility; 
b.  The streamlined process set forth above shall apply to applications for all modifications and to applications for all proposed co-locations that meet the following requirements:

ARTICLE IX. - VARIANCES 

Sec. 113-235. - Procedures for variances. 
(a)  Recommendations . Applications for variances are heard initially by the planning commission in a public hearing. All applications shall be submitted by the owner of the affected property or the authorized agent of the owner.

The mayor and council shall take final action on the application subsequent to receiving a recommendation from the planning commission. 
(b)  Request for a variance . The planning commission may recommend, and the mayor and council may grant, a variance from the terms of these regulations as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to the special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, so that the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done; provided, however, that a variance shall not be granted for a use of land or building or structure that is prohibited by this section in the zoning district in question. The planning commission may recommend, and the mayor and council may grant, a variance in an individual case upon a finding that the following exists: 
(1)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography; and 
(2)  The application of these regulations to this particular piece of property would create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; and 
(3)  Such conditions are peculiar to the particular piece of property involved; and 
(4)  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of these regulations; provided, however no variance may be granted for a use of land, building, or structure that is prohibited herein; and 
(5)  A literal interpretation of the zoning ordinance would deprive the applicant of any rights that others in the same zoning district are allowed; and 
(6)  Provided that the planning commission may recommend, and the mayor and council may impose or require, such additional restrictions and standards as may be necessary to protect the health and safety of workers in the general neighborhoods; and provided that wherever the mayor and council shall find, in the case of any permit granted pursuant to the provisions of these regulations, that any of the terms, conditions, or restrictions upon which such permit was granted are not being complied with, the mayor and council shall rescind and revoke such permit after giving due notice to all parties concerned and granting full opportunity for a hearing. In exercising the above power, the mayor and council shall not consider any nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the same zoning district, and no permitted use of lands, structures or buildings in other zoning districts as grounds for the issuance of a variance. 
(c)  Compliance with standards . Where an application to the planning commission and the mayor and council is initiated due to an existing violation of the zoning ordinance and the application is denied, the violation shall be required to be corrected within ten days of such denial or as specified by the mayor and council if a greater period of time is necessary. The maximum extension of time shall not exceed 30 days.

(8)  A letter of intent indicating specifically how the property is to be used. Said letter shall be detailed as necessary to clearly describe the proposed site development, existing uses and zoning of nearby property; 
(9)  List the extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular use or development proposed, or to the piece of property in question because of its size, shape, topography or other condition, which justifies the variance; 
(10)  Explain how the strict application of the zoning ordinance requirements to the use or development proposed, or to this particular piece of property, results in great practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship; 
(11)  Explain how the extraordinary and exceptional conditions identified above are peculiar to the use or development proposed or to the particular piece of property involved;

In reviewing the application, the zoning administrator shall analyze the application to determine whether granting the request would cause substantial detriment to other property owners in the surrounding area or would impair the purposes of the zoning ordinance. If the request is in conformance with these requirements and does not adversely affect the area, the zoning administrator shall issue an official determination in writing approving the request. The property owner, the town clerk, and the building official shall be provided with a copy of this determination. If the request is not in conformance with these requirements or may possibly have an adverse effect on the surrounding area, the zoning administrator shall deny the appeal in writing, stating the reasons for the denial.
