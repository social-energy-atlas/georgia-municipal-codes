PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of Clayton County, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1973 Code, as supplemented through March 3, 1992, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners through May 3, 1994. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1973 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 

 
Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor, and Ron McLaughlin, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Mr. C. Crandle Bray, Chairman of the Board of Commissioners, Ms. Margarette A. Swaim, Clerk to the Board of Commissioners, and Mr. Joe Shelnutt, Director of Community Development, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement. Ordinances that are of a general and permanent nature are codified in the Code Book and are considered "Includes." Ordinances that are not of a general and permanent nature are not codified in the Code Book and are considered "Omits." 
In addition, by adding to this table with each supplement, users of this Code of Ordinances will be able to gain a more complete picture of the code's historical evolution.

--- (1) --- 
Editor's note— This Part consists of related laws of the General Assembly of particular application to Clayton County. The acts are organized by subject matter. Each act is set out as adopted by the General Assembly, with amendments, if any, worked in. At the end of each section appears a reference to the basic Act and amendatory Acts, if any. The editor has added section numbers and catchlines to facilitate use and indexing. However, formal citations should be to the original Act, and not to this compilation. A uniform system of punctuation, capitalization, expression of numbers in text and citation to state statutes has been used and obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation. Where the editor has added clarifying words or phrases in the text of an Act, such words or phrases appear in brackets.

Sec. 7-5. - Administration, appointment, and election of board members. 
(a)  Each district created pursuant hereto shall be administered by a board composed of seven members to be appointed and elected as hereinafter provided. One board member shall be appointed by the Clayton County board of commissioners if any portion of the district lies within the unincorporated areas of Clayton County, one board member shall be appointed by the governing authority of each municipality within which the district is now or hereafter partially located if any portion of the district lies within the incorporated area of such municipality, and the remaining board members shall be elected by the owners of the real property within the district subject to taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board. The appointed board members shall serve at the pleasure of the governing body which appointed same, respectively.

(b)  The initial board members to be elected as provided herein shall be elected in a caucus of electors which shall be held within 60 days after the adoption of the resolutions and obtaining the written consents herein provided at such time and place within the district as the Clayton County board of commissioners, or governing body of the municipality if the district lies wholly within the incorporated area thereof, shall designate after notice thereof shall have been given to said electors by publishing same in the legal organ of Clayton County as hereinafter provided.

If a vacancy occurs in an elected position on the board, the board shall, within 60 days thereafter, call a special election to fill the same to be held within 60 days of the call unless such vacancy occurs within 180 days of the next regularly scheduled election, in which case a special election may, but need not, be called. For any election held hereunder, notice of said election shall be given the electors by publishing notice thereof in the legal organ of Clayton County on four dates, at least 45 days, 31 days, 17 days, and ten days, respectively, prior to such election. 
(c)  The elected board members shall be subject to recall as any other elected public official by the electors hereinabove defined.

If the boundaries of a district or a municipality are subsequently changed after creation of a district to include land within the unincorporated area of Clayton County and the district originally had no land within the unincorporated area of Clayton County, the Clayton County board of commissioners shall acquire the right to appoint a member to the board of the district upon entering into the cooperation agreement provided for in section 7-9. The new appointed board member in such cases shall take office upon the vacation of the first elected board member's office to be vacated, by expiration of term, death, resignation, or recall, and that office shall thereafter be appointed by such governing authority. If by municipal annexation or by deannexation of land from a district, the district no longer includes land within the unincorporated area of Clayton County or within a municipality, respectively, then upon such occurrence the board member of the district appointed by such governing authority in which the district is no longer located shall cease to be a board member and such member shall thereafter be elected as otherwise herein provided.

(Ga. Laws 1992, p. 5698, § 5) 
Sec. 7-6. - Taxes, fees, and assessments. 
(a)  The board may levy taxes, fees, and assessments within the district only on real property used nonresidentially, specifically excluding all property exempt from ad valorem taxation under the constitution or laws of the State of Georgia and all property used for residential, agricultural, or forestry purposes and specifically excluding tangible personal property and intangible property. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall not exceed one percent of the aggregate assessed value of all such real property. The taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board upon the properties shall be equitably apportioned among the properties subject to such taxes, fees, and assessments according to the need for governmental services and facilities created by the degree of density of development of each such property. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments levied by the board shall be used only for the purpose of providing governmental services and facilities which are specially required by the degree of density of development within the district and not for the purpose of providing those governmental services and facilities provided to the county or municipality as a whole. Any tax, fee, or assessment so levied shall be collected by Clayton County if the district lies wholly or partly within the unincorporated area of Clayton County, and by the municipality within which it lies if it is wholly within a municipality, in the same manner as taxes, fees, and assessments are levied by Clayton County or the municipality, respectively. Delinquent taxes shall bear the same interest and penalties as Clayton County or municipal ad valorem taxes, respectively, and may be enforced and collected in the same manner. The proceeds of taxes, fees, and assessments so levied, less a fee to cover the costs of collection of one percent thereof, but not more than $25,000.00 in any one calendar year, shall be transmitted by Clayton County or the municipality which collects same, to the board and shall be expended by the board only for the purposes authorized hereby. 
(b)  The board shall levy the above-provided taxes between January 1 and June 1 each calendar year and notify in writing the collecting governing bodies by June 15 each year so they may include the levy on their regular ad valorem tax bills. 
(c)  If, but for this provision, a parcel of real property is removed from a district or otherwise would become nontaxable it shall continue to bear its tax millage then extant upon such event, for bonded indebtedness of the district then outstanding, until said bonded indebtedness then outstanding is paid or refunded. 
(Ga. Laws 1992, p. 5698, § 6) 
Sec. 7-7. - Boundaries of the districts. 
(a)  The boundaries of each district shall be as designated as such by the Clayton County board of commissioners if wholly within the unincorporated area of Clayton County and such municipalities within which the district may be partially located if partially within the unincorporated area of Clayton County and partially within one or more municipalities, or by the governing authority of a municipality if wholly within the incorporated area thereof, as set forth in the resolutions required in section 7-4, or as may thereafter be added as hereinafter provided. 
(b)  The boundaries of a district may be increased after the initial creation of a district pursuant to the following:

(c)  Issuance by a board of one or more series of bonds, notes, or other obligations for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds, notes, or other obligations in connection with the same project or with any other project; but the proceeding wherein any subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations are issued shall recognize and protect any prior loan agreement, security agreement, or other agreement or instrument made for any prior issue of bonds, notes, or other obligations, unless in the resolution authorizing such prior issue the right is expressly reserved to the board to issue subsequent bonds, notes, or other obligations on a parity with such prior issue.

Sec. 2-35. - Agenda, duties of the presiding officer, minutes, quorum, public comment. 
Section 2-35-01. Agenda. The clerk of the board of commissioners shall prepare an agenda for each regular and called meeting of the board. The regular monthly meetings shall consist of two business meetings. 
(a)  Preparation of the agenda for regular meetings. Any commissioner wishing to place an item on the agenda may do so and should submit a resolution or ordinance approved by the county attorney, or a memorandum with any supporting documents to the clerk by the close of business on the Wednesday before the next meeting. Items submitted after that time will be placed on the agenda for the meeting immediately following the next meeting. 
(b)  Department heads wishing to place an item on the agenda. Any department head may submit an item to the chief operating officer for consideration as an agenda item. Such items shall be reviewed by the chief operating officer to insure that the item is consistent with the policies and direction of the board of commissioners, and that any required budgetary impact is reviewed and approved by the chief financial officer. Such items shall also be reviewed and approved by the staff attorney's office, except for budget items submitted by the finance department. If approved, the chief operating officer will notify the clerk and supply supporting documents by close of business on the Wednesday before the next meeting. Items submitted after that time will be placed on the agenda for the meeting immediately following the next meeting. 
(c)  Preparation and publication of the agenda. The clerk shall prepare the agenda by the close of business on the Thursday preceding the meeting. Nothing further can be placed on the agenda by the clerk after Thursday. The agenda shall be published to the full board and the public by close of business on the Friday before the meeting. 
(d)  Adding items to the agenda during a meeting. Adding during the meeting is disfavored and should only occur for urgent business matters that need to be addressed at that meeting. Adding an item requires three affirmative votes. A motion must be made, seconded and carried to add each item to the agenda. 
(e)  Removing an item from the agenda prior to adoption. After the meeting has been called to order and before the agenda is adopted, any commissioner may call for its removal. If the chair hears no objection, the item is removed. If an objection is heard, the chair will treat the commissioner's call for removal of the agenda item as a main motion and call for debate. After the item is debated, the chair will call for a second and if seconded the chair will call for a vote. Three affirmative votes are required to remove an item after an objection. 
(f)  Changes to an adopted agenda. Once the agenda is adopted, items can only be added if the subject matter is so urgent that immediate action of the board is required in the best interest of the public. 
(g)  Consent agenda. The board of commissioners will use a consent agenda which lists items of routine nature such as renewal of grants, refund request, and other similar matters. Any items of business that are expected to receive unanimous approval and for which debate is not expected, should be placed on the consent agenda. Items may be removed from the consent agenda for further discussion by any commissioner. The consent agenda is adopted with one motion. 
(h)  Agendas for other meetings of the board. Agendas for other meetings of the board sitting as the zoning board or otherwise, shall be prepared in a like manner with the last date for adding items to the agenda to be four working days prior to the call of the meeting. The clerk is to finalize and publish the agenda no less than 72 hours prior to the call of the meeting. 
Section. 2-35-02 Presiding officer. 
(a)  The chairman of the board of commissioners, or in his absence the vice-chair, shall be the presiding officer at all meetings of the board of commissioners. 
(b)  The presiding officer is responsible for the orderly conduct of the meeting.

For any event not covered by these meeting procedures, Roberts Rules of Order Newly Revised shall control. 
(c)  The presiding officer shall rely on the county attorney for guidance on these meeting procedures and any other parliamentary issues. 
(d)  By virtue of his or her election to the board of commissioners, the presiding officer shall retain the right to debate any matter that comes before the board and to vote on any such matter. 
Section 2-35-03. Minutes. The clerk is responsible for recording the minutes of the meeting. The minutes shall not be a verbatim transcript of the meeting. The minutes shall follow the agenda. The minutes shall include the names of the commissioners present at the meeting, a description of each proposal or motion made, and a record of all votes. If the meeting was called with less than 24 hours' notice, the minutes must reflect the reason or special circumstance that lead to holding the meeting with less than 24 hours' notice. If the board goes into executive session, the minutes must record the vote and reason for the executive session. Also, an affidavit from the presiding officer certifying that the executive session was limited to exempt topics must be attached to the minutes. Minutes will not be kept of an executive session, except for meetings convened to discuss the accusation of real property where minutes must be made but will remain confidential until the property in question is purchased or abandoned. Public comment will be noted but not transcribed. 
Section 2-35-04. Quorum. Upon call to order by the presiding officer, the presence of at least three commissioners, including the presiding officer, constitutes a quorum and all business on the agenda can be handled. 
Section 2-35-05. Public comment. The board welcomes public comment; however to manage available time, public comment will be limited to three minutes per speaker at each regular business meeting and work session of the board of commissioners, however in no event shall the public comment period last longer than 30 minutes at any single meeting. At the end of the thirty minute public comment period, if any member of the public who has signed up to speak has not been reached, that person shall have the right to be carried forward to the next regular meeting of the board and shall be placed at the top of the list at that meeting.

(Ord. No. 2007-64, 4-17-07; Ord. No. 2009-22, § 3, 2-3-09; Ord. No. 2009-206, § 1, 12-15-09; Ord. No. 2013-16, Pt. I, 1-2-13; Ord. No. 2016-184, §§ 1, 2, 12-20-16) 
Sec. 2-36. - Parliamentary procedures of the board of commissioners. 
Section 2-36-01. Main motion. In order for a board to take any official action on any subject, a commissioner must propose a main motion. A proposed main motion will not be recognized by the chair until another commissioner agrees to second the motion. A second does not require the commissioner seconding the motion to support the motion. A commissioner may withdraw a main motion that he has made at any time before the board has voted on that motion. 
Section 2-36-02. Debate. After the main motion is recognized by the chair, the board shall debate the motion. The debate shall be managed by the chairman in a manner that is fair to all members of the board. Specifically, every commissioner will be afforded an opportunity to speak during debate of any item, commissioners shall indicate the desire to speak and the chairman shall recognize said commissioner. Debate may end after every commissioner, who desires to speak, has been afforded an opportunity to speak on a topic of debate. 
During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce subsidiary motions that propose that the board take a particular action on a motion (section 2-05). There are two classes of subsidiary motions: Debatable subsidiary motions and un-debatable subsidiary motions. Debatable subsidiary motions consist of motions to postpone indefinitely, amend, refer to committee, and postpone to a time certain. Debatable subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. There are three un-debatable subsidiary motions: limit debate, vote immediately, and lay on the table. They require a second and cannot be debated. 
Commissioners may also introduce privileged motions (section 2-06). Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting and can be introduced during the course of debate. Privileged motions consist of a motion to raise a question of privilege and motions to recess and adjourn. The motions to recess and adjourn require a second. Debate is not allowed on privileged motions. 
Section 2-36-03. Voting: Procedure. Voting on debatable motions and voting on un-debatable motions shall take place in accordance with the following provisions. 
(1)  Debatable motions. In the case of debatable motions, the vote can be proposed in one of two ways: (1) If debate has been completed and no other commissioner wishes to speak, the chair can call for the vote. If there are no objections then the chair can proceed with the vote; (2) If the chairman calls for the vote and there is an objection, a member of the board may move to vote immediately ("move the previous question"). If this motion is seconded and approved by a 2/3 vote, debate will stop. The chairman will then read the proposed motion to the board and ask for the votes of the commissioners. 
(2)  Un-debatable motions. In the case of un-debatable motions, the vote shall occur immediately after the motion is recognized by the chair. The chairman shall read the proposed motion to the board and then call for the vote. 
Section 2-36-04. Ranking of motions. Each subsidiary and privileged motion is assigned a specific rank. a motion of higher precedence can interrupt a motion of lower precedence. 
(1)  The higher motion must be decided before the board returns to consider the motion of lower precedence. 
(2)  A main motion has the lowest rank and does not take precedence over any other motion. A motion to adjourn has the highest rank and will take precedence over all other subsidiary and privileged motions. The order of precedence of motions shall be in accordance with this section. Motions at the top of the following list take precedence over motions at the bottom of the list. 
HIGHEST RANK: 
Privileged motions (Un-debatable) 
1.  Adjourn 
2.  Recess 
3.  Question of privilege 
Subsidiary motions (Un-debatable) 
4.  Lay on the table (postpone temporarily) 
5.  Vote immediately (previous question) 
6.  Limit debate or extend 
Subsidiary Motions (debatable) 
7.  Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely) 
8.  Refer to committee (commit) 
9.  Amend 
10.  Postpone indefinitely 
Other motions 
LOWEST RANK: 
11.  Main motion 
Section 2-36-05. Subsidiary motions. During the course of debate, commissioners may introduce motions that propose that the board take a particular action on a main motion. These motions are called subsidiary motions and they allow a board to reach a conclusion on the main motion. Subsidiary motions require a second before they can be voted on or debated. Three subsidiary motions, amend, limit debate, and vote immediately also can apply to other subsidiary motions. 
(1)  Postpone indefinitely. If a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered by the board, that commissioner may move to postpone the consideration of the main motion indefinitely. If the motion is successful, consideration of the main motion stops and the main motion is tabled for the duration of the meeting. A motion to postpone indefinitely can be debated but it cannot be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
(2)  Amend. If a commissioner believes that a main motion that is on the table should be changed in order to make it more acceptable, he can move to amend the motion. Amendments must be closely related to the original motion and must not change the nature of the motion that they amend. Motions to refer, amend, postpone to a time certain and the motion to recess can also be amended. A motion cannot be amended more than two times. Debate is allowed on a motion to amend only if the original motion is debatable. Debate is limited to the proposed amendment. A majority vote is required for the board to adopt an amendment. If the amendment is adopted then the board shall consider the amended version of the motion. 
(3)  Refer to a committee (commit). If a commissioner believes that further information is needed before the board can act on a main motion, he may propose that the motion be referred to a specific committee or department for further study. If an appropriate committee does not already exist, then a committee may be formed as a part of the motion. A motion to commit should specify the date that the committee or department will report back to the board. This motion is debatable and amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
(4)  Postpone to a time certain (postpone definitely). A motion to postpone to a certain time may be proposed if a commissioner believes that the main motion should not be considered until a future time. This motion shall set a particular time for the main motion to be considered again. It is debatable and can be amended. If this motion is passed, the chairman will bring the original motion back to the board for consideration at the specified time which may be at the same meeting, at a subsequent meeting, or upon the occurrence of a specified event. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
(5)  Limit or extend limits of debate. A motion to limit debate places a time constraint on the length of debate. The details of such a motion are to be decided by the commissioner who makes the motion. This motion can also be used to extend the limits of debate if a limit on debate already exists. Debate is not allowed on this motion and a 2/3 vote is required. 
(6)  Vote immediately (previous question.) If a commissioner believes debate on a motion should end and that the motion that is being considered should be voted on, the commissioner can move to vote immediately. The motion is un-debatable and a vote of 2/3 of the board is required for the motion to pass. 
(7)  Lay on the table (postpone temporarily.) A motion to lay on the table proposes that the consideration of a main motion be postponed until a later time in the same meeting. The main motion can be brought back for consideration only if a motion to resume consideration is accepted by the board during the same meeting. The motion will die if it is not taken up during the meeting. Debate is not allowed on this motion and the motion is not amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
Section 2-36-06. Privileged motions. Privileged motions facilitate the running of the meeting. They do not address or relate to a main motion and can be introduced whether or not there is a main motion under consideration. Privileged motions take precedence over all subsidiary motions. Debate is not allowed on these motions. 
(1)  Question of privilege. A formal question addressed to the chair concerning the rights of a commissioner or of the board as a whole is referred to as a question of privilege. It does not require a second and cannot be debated or amended. The chair is required to make a ruling on the question. 
(2)  Recess. A motion to recess proposes that the meeting be suspended for a particular amount of time when business is still pending. It is a temporary intermission of the proceedings. The motion must specify the length of the recess. The motion must also be seconded. Debate is not allowed on this motion but the motion can be amended. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
(3)  Adjourn. In order for a meeting to come to a close, a commissioner must make a motion to adjourn. The motion to adjourn has the highest rank of any motion and as a result it can be introduced at any time. The motion requires a second, but is not debatable or amendable. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
Section 2-36-07. Incidental motions. Incidental motions allow commissioners to exert their rights as a member of the board. Incidental motions can be introduced at any time during a meeting. 
(1)  Appeal. If a commissioner disagrees with a ruling that is made by the chair, that commissioner may appeal the decision. If the appeal is seconded, the appeal will be considered by the board. The chair has the opportunity to explain the ruling that has been challenged. The board may then debate the appeal. The board shall decide by majority vote if the chair's decision is to be upheld or overturned. An appeal is high in precedence and can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or by a motion to lay on the table. 
(2)  Parliamentary inquiry. If a commissioner has a question about the rules or order, he may ask the chair to give an opinion on that question. This question should take the form of a parliamentary inquiry and should relate to the current business of the board. This motion takes precedence over all motions except privileged motions. This motion does not require a second and is not debatable or amendable. 
(3)  Point of order (question of order). If a commissioner believes that a violation of the rules of parliamentary procedure has occurred, he can raise a point of order. A second is not required. The chair can make a ruling on the question or can allow the board to debate and then rule on the question by majority vote. A point of order can only be interrupted by a privileged motion or a motion to lay on the table. 
(4)  Point of information (request for information). If a commissioner has a question about the facts of a particular issue that is being considered, he may ask a point of information. This motion is addressed first to the chair and then to the appropriate person. A second is not required and the motion is not debatable or amendable. 
Section 2-36-08. Supplementary main motions. Three motions allow the board to act on a main motion that has either been passed or tabled by the board. These motions are considered to be main motions but differ from usual main motions in the ways specified. 
(1)  Reconsider. The motion to reconsider allows the board to debate whether or not to overturn a decision made at the meeting that is in progress. It allows the board to consider new information that may affect the decision that has already been made. Any commissioner can make a motion to reconsider and any commissioner may second the motion. The motion is debatable but it cannot be amended. A majority vote of the board is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to reconsider is passed, the original decision will be voided and the board will return to debate and revote the original motion. 
(2)  Rescind. A motion to rescind proposes that the board overturn a motion passed at a previous meeting. A motion to rescind can be made by any commissioner. It is in order as long as the original motion has not been implemented. An announcement of the intention to rescind a motion may be made at the meeting where the decision was made, or the commissioner seeking to rescind may place the matter on the agenda for the next meeting. The motion to rescind will then be placed on the agenda for the next meeting. At the next meeting, the motion to rescind will formally be made. If it is seconded, then the board shall debate and vote on rescission. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. If a motion to rescind is passed, the original decision will be voided. 
(3)  Resume consideration. The motion to resume consideration allows the board to consider a motion that has been temporarily postponed. This motion requires a second and is not debatable or amendable. It is a main motion but ranks higher than any debatable motion. A majority vote is required for the motion to pass. 
Section 2-36-09. Abstentions. Commissioners shall generally vote on all matters coming before the board. If a commissioner has a personal interest in the matter such as to create a conflict of interest then the commissioner shall be permitted to abstain with cause, provided the commissioner shall disclose the nature of the conflict and shall not have participated in any discussion or debate of the matter at issue. If a commissioner abstains without cause (i.e. without disclosing a conflict of interest) then such vote shall be treated as a vote in favor of the pending motion and the commissioner's vote shall have the same effect as if he/she voted on the prevailing side. 
Section 2-36-10. Finance committee. 
(a)  The board of commissioners hereby establishes a finance committee. The committee shall consist of two members of the board of commissioners as selected by the board, whose terms shall expire on December 31 of the year in which they are selected. The purpose of the committee will be to review those matters that are referred to the committee for further study by the board pertaining to the finances of the county. Such matters may also include reviewing and/or recommending policies affecting the finances of the county. The committee may also review an issue or matter submitted to the chairman of the finance committee by any commissioner. When matters are referred to the committee, the committee shall report back to the board at the next regular meeting of the board or such other date as specified at the time the matter is referred to the committee. The report may include recommendations to the full board as to whether the matter should be approved or denied or modified, if applicable. When matters are submitted to the committee by a commissioner, the committee shall review the matter as the committee deems appropriate. Finally, the committee shall review monthly reports prepared by the director of finance providing the status of the current fiscal year's budget to date. The monthly reports shall be distributed to all commissioners at the same time as they are distributed to the committee. 
(b)  The committee shall meet, as needed at 112 Smith Street, as often as necessary to review those matters referred to the committee for consideration. All meetings of the committee shall be open to the public and notice of meetings (providing the date, time and location) shall be published and posted by the clerk of the board of commissioners.

(Ord. No. 2017-45, § 1, 6-6-17) 
Sec. 2-97. - Ethics. 
It is the policy of Clayton County to seek the best overall value when procuring goods and services. Toward this end, the county finds and declares that its objectives will best be achieved through an open, competitive process with a broad range of responsible suppliers wishing to furnish products and services to the county. Clayton County will set up and conduct a purchasing program that maximizes service benefit to the community and awards contracts to suppliers who offer the best value. 
(1)  Clayton County declares that employees and officials, along with those wishing to do business with the county, have the shared responsibility for avoiding biased, anticompetitive or unethical practices. 
(2)  Clayton County employees, officials, and their family members are prohibited from seeking, requesting, or receiving any material payment, gift, job offer, security, promise of future benefit, or any other tangible or intangible thing of value when such receipt has the potential to influence a procurement decision or to gain unfair advantage in a procurement competition, and as outlined in the County's Ethics Code found in Article 2, Section 70-61, et seq. and all other applicable policies. 
(3)  Prospective suppliers must compete for county business within the parameters of the solicitation process and are prohibited from seeking to obtain inside information, attempting to skew the writing of specifications or influencing a procurement decision through any means outside the process established for the particular solicitation. This principle applies to any contractor, subcontractor, representative, employee, or agent that may be associated with a procurement transaction. 
(4)  Ethical business practices are important both during a solicitation and after the decision to grant an award. To this end, the county seeks to establish relationships with suppliers whose ongoing ethical standards of business conduct are congruent with those outlined here. The director is charged with establishing methods for ongoing monitoring for non-compliance with these principles. The prohibition against the offering of or the acceptance of kickbacks, gratuities, payments or any other thing of value extends beyond and outside any specific procurement or solicitation. Violations by Clayton County employees and officials will be governed by the Clayton County Civil Service Rules and the Clayton County Code of Ethics, Clayton County Code of Ordinances, Art. II § 70-61, et seq. 
(5)  A supplier's contract compliance history with Clayton County and other contractual parties is a valid element in the decision to award a solicitation. 
(6)  Clayton County stipulates that the furtherance of its strategic goals for job creation, stability and growth in the tax base, business retention, and other fiscal and economic development objectives may be considered during the procurement process. The director is authorized to establish procurement initiatives consistent with the county's strategic economic development objectives. These procurement practices shall be applied consistently and equitably, and shall have a direct relationship to the county's goals. 
(7)  Clayton County employees, officials, and their family members are prohibited from participation in any procurement decision or any gain of unfair advantage in a procurement competition as a result of contemporaneous employment with a potential or actual business partner. When a conflict of interest is discovered, the employee involved shall promptly file a written statement concerning the matter with an appropriate supervisor. The person may also request written instructions and disposition of the matter. If an actual violation occurs or is not disclosed and remedied, the employee involved may be reprimanded, suspended, or dismissed pursuant to the Clayton County Civil Service Rules and the supplier or potential supplier may be placed on the ineligible source list and/or have their existing contract canceled. 
(8)  It is unethical for any Clayton County employee or official to purchase goods and/or services from a county contract for personal use, unless the goods and/or services are made available to employees through the contract specifically for that purpose. 
(9)  Individuals, firms and businesses seeking an award of a Clayton County contract may not initiate or continue any verbal or written communications regarding a solicitation with any county officer, elected official, employee or other county representative other than the department of central services employee named in the solicitation between the date of the issuance of the solicitation and the date of the final contract award by the board of commissioners, unless specified otherwise herein. Attempting to influence the outcome of any given contract prior to a recommendation of award to the board of commissioners is strictly prohibited. The director will review alleged violations of this prohibition. If the director determines that such a communication has compromised the competitive process, the offer submitted by that person may be disqualified from consideration for award, and that person may, among other things, be placed on the ineligible source list. Violations by Clayton County employees and officials will be governed by the Clayton County Civil Service Rules. Violations may also be subject to prosecution under federal, state or local laws.

DIVISION 3. - PURCHASING METHODS 

Sec. 2-111. - Summary of general purchasing methods. 
This Purchasing Code recognizes two methods of procurement: competitive and non-competitive. The director shall make the determination as to the type of procurement appropriate to secure all commodities, equipment and services for the county, its agencies and departments. 
(1)  Competitive procurement methods. 
a.  Competitive sealed bidding. In most cases the competitive sealed bid is the preferred method of purchase in the public sector and should be used whenever possible as it allows qualified, responsive bidders to compete on the basis of price. Generally, the following conditions must be met: 
1.  clear and adequate specifications; 
2.  cost of materials, supplies, equipment, or services is in excess of $74,999.99; and/or 
3.  revenue is expected to be in excess of $74,999.99. 
Unless otherwise provided herein, formal sealed bids must be obtained for any item or service which is expected to cost in excess of $74,999.99 or is expected to generate revenue greater than $74,999.99, unless the competitive sealed bid process is either not applicable or is determined by the director not to be in the best interest of the county as outlined herein. Information related to the process for competitive sealed bids is outlined herein in section 2-113. 
b.  Competitive sealed proposal. When the following factors exist or use of the competitive sealed bid is either not practical or not advantageous to the county, a contract may be entered into by use of the competitive sealed proposal. Factors include: 
1.  whether quality, availability or capability is overriding in relation to price in procurement of technical supplies or technical or professional services; 
2.  whether the initial installation needs to be evaluated together with subsequent maintenance and service capabilities; 
3.  whether the market place will respond better to a solicitation permitting not only a range of alternate proposals, but evaluation and discussion of them before making the award; 
4.  cost of equipment or services is in excess of $74,999.99; and/or 
5.  revenue is expected to be in excess of $74,999.99. 
Unless otherwise provided herein, formal sealed proposals must be obtained for any item or service which is expected to cost in excess of $74,999.99 or is expected to generate revenue greater than $74,999.99, unless the competitive sealed proposal process is either not applicable or is determined by the director not to be in the best interest of the county as outlined herein. Information related to the process for competitive sealed proposals is outlined herein in section 2-113. 
c.  Informal purchase. Any purchase of commodities, goods and services less than $74,999.99 will be considered an informal purchase. The director is authorized to establish the methods and procedures to be used in handling informal purchases. Unless otherwise specifically provided, such informal purchases will be obtained competitively through written quotes. In most instances, this may be accomplished through a purchase order and does not require a formal, written agreement. However, the director may, in his/her discretion, require that certain purchases be accomplished through formal, written agreement. Information related to the process for informal purchases is outlined herein in section 2-115. 
(2)  Non-competitive procurement methods. 
a.  Sole source purchase. A sole source purchase may be used when only one supplier is able to fill the requirements for the intended commodities, goods and/or services. All sole source purchases must be authorized by the director. Prior to authorization, written justification must be signed by the department director and submitted to the department of central services for evaluation. Information related to the process for sole source purchases is outlined herein in section 2-116. 
b.  Special purchases. The director may initiate a special purchase where he/she determines that such purchase does not technically qualify as a sole source purchase under the Purchasing Code. If determined as appropriate by the director, any special purchase under this section shall be made with such competition as is practicable under the circumstances. The director may determine under appropriate circumstances that there is only one logical choice as to a contractor to provide the goods or services necessitated by the special purchase. The special purchase must be authorized and certified by the director or his/her designee with thorough reasoning given for the special purchase designation. Special purchases where cost is in excess of $74,999.99 or is expected to generate revenue greater than $74,999.99 must be authorized by the board of commissioners. Information related to the process for special purchases is outlined herein in section 2-117. 
c.  Emergency Purchases. An emergency exists when there is a threat to the health, welfare or safety of people or property, when there is a material loss of essential government services. The competitive process should be followed whenever possible in an emergency as long as the ability to respond to the emergency is not seriously impaired. The emergency purchase process is reserved for rare and extreme circumstances. Therefore, rarely will the emergency purchase process be utilized. All emergency purchases must be authorized by the director or his/her designee with direct authorization by the department director requesting the emergency purchase. Emergency purchases of $74,999 or greater must be ratified by official action of the board of commissioners at the next available commission meeting and the reason for the emergency must be contained in the minutes of the meeting. Information related to the process for emergency purchases is outlined herein in section 2-118. 
d.  Cooperative purchase. The county may participate in a cooperative purchase for the acquisition of commodities, supplies and services through an authorized contract of any other governmental entity or agency whether federal, state or local, provided a competitive procurement process has been followed and the cooperative purchase is determined by the director to be in the best interest of the county. The director or his/her designee must certify that the acquisition of commodities, supplies or services are an exact match of those items offered to the other governmental entity or agency. Information related to the process cooperative purchases is outlined herein in section 2-119. 
e.  Governmental and affiliated entity purchase. The county may purchase services and incidental commodities from other federal and state or local governments when determined to be in the best interest of the county. Information related to the process for governmental and affiliated entity purchases is outlined herein in section 2-120.

(1)  criteria for pre-qualification shall be reasonably related to the project or the quality of the work;

The details of that investigation, including findings, shall be recorded and maintained by the CCD. 
(g)  Evaluation of compliance. Pursuant to section 2-152.1 of this division, prior to issuing a notice of award the CCD shall review a bid when the contract administrator has reached an intent to award. 
(Ord. No. 2017-45, § 1, 6-6-17) 
Sec. 2-149. - Small local business opportunity program. 
(a)  Purpose. 
(1)  The purpose of the SLBE program of the county is to promote the economic welfare of the people of the county and to promote full and equal business opportunity for all persons doing business with the county by providing assistance to SLBEs that would allow them to actively participate in the county's procurement process, and by working to eliminate discrimination in both public and private markets. The county seeks to determine whether eliminating discrimination against and assisting all small firms in a race and gender-neutral fashion will eliminate identified discrimination against MWBEs and eliminate the need for race and gender conscious actions. 
(2)  The county, through the CCD and in accordance with this section, in its ongoing effort to evaluate the utilization of MWBEs to assure equal opportunity with regard to county procurement activities and assist in collecting data to determine whether a race-conscious initiative will be necessary to effectuate that objective, will monitor the progress of this program in that regard. 
(b)  Responsibilities. Affected county offices shall be responsible for the performance of the following duties and obligations for purposes of implementing and achieving the policies and objectives of this program: 
(1)  Contract compliance division (CCD). The contract compliance division shall collect and evaluate reporting data, which will be submitted to the Director of Central Services. 
The contract compliance division is charged with the responsibility of investigating and coordinating administrative hearings to evaluate and address program protest matters. 
(2)  Reporting and compliance monitoring. The CCD shall monitor and collect data concerning program activity within the respective departments to assure compliance. 
(3)  Rules and regulations. The CCD shall issue and enforce rules and regulations for the small local business and procurement non-discrimination program authorized by this chapter. 
(4)  Small business assistance. 
Information. The CCD shall act as a resource for small business information. 
Outreach. The CCD shall undertake to raise the consciousness of SLBE communities about county business opportunities and how to take advantage of the program benefits. 
Certification. The CCD shall be responsible for certification, recertification, and decertification of SLBEs and MWBEs under this division. 
Records and reports of contractors. Contractors shall submit reports in accordance with the provisions of this division. 
Access to training—Technical assistance. The CCD shall act as a resource for technical assistance. The department shall collect, organize and disseminate information regarding available training resources in the county. 
Access to capital—Financing. The CCD shall act as a resource for financial assistance. The department shall collect, organize and disseminate information regarding available capital or financing sources in the county economy. 
Access to markets. The CCD will facilitate access to markets for SLBEs. 
(c)  County-maintained records and reports. 
(1)  The effectiveness of this program will be measured by a review of prime and subcontract utilization of all firms indicating awards made to SLBEs inside the county, SLBEs outside the county, and MWBEs. Program effectiveness measurements will also include efforts by the CCD to provide prime contracting opportunities for SLBEs. At the end of each contract, the CCD will prepare a report on the utilization of firms in the SLBE opportunity program as compared to all firms utilized by the county. Data in this report will include information on the gross income size of the firms participating on each contract with their NIGP Codes, race or ethnicity and gender status, and address, including county. Each project manager and procurement officer will continuously maintain, and compile monthly, information relating to the department's use of SLBE, including information regarding subcontractors and attainment toward the SLBE opportunity program participation goal. 
Data on MWBE utilization will be used to determine if there are barriers to their participation that persists despite efforts to assist SLBEs. 
(2)  At the end of a contract, the CCD shall require a contractor to report to the CCD the identity of each SLBE to whom the contractor has awarded a subcontract for the purchase of supplies, materials and equipment. 
(3)  The CCD shall prepare a consolidated report based on a compilation and analysis of the reports submitted by each project manager and reports of payments provided by the finance department. This consolidated report will identify and assess SLBE and MWBE contract awards, prime contractors' progress in achieving SLBE subcontract goals, and other SLBE development and contracting efforts. Specifically, the CCD will maintain records showing: 
a.  Awards to SLBEs, including names of contractors and subcontractors, nature of the work/services performed, NIGP Codes, and the percentage of SLBE and MWBE participation per contract. The CCD will obtain regular reports from prime contractors on their progress in meeting contractual SLBE commitments; 
b.  Specific efforts to award contracts to SLBEs; 
c.  Copies of direct mailings to SLBEs; 
d.  Pre-bid conference information as it relates to SLBE program; 
e.  Requests for assistance from SLBEs interested in bidding/proposing on county contracts and subcontracts; 
f.  Workshops, seminars and training programs conducted for SLBEs and MWBEs; 
g.  Efforts to assist SLBEs in acquiring bonding and insurance. 
(4)  The contract compliance division will submit quarterly SLBE development reports to the central services director. These reports shall include: 
a.  The number of contracts awarded to SLBEs and MWBEs; 
b.  A description of the general categories of contracts awarded to SLBEs and MWBEs; 
c.  The dollar value of contracts awarded to SLBEs and MWBEs; 
d.  The percentage of the dollar value of all contracts awarded to SLBEs and MWBEs during the preceding quarter; and 
e.  An indication of whether or not, and the extent to which, the percentage was a reasonable representation of SLBE and MWBE utilization for the region. 
(5)  The MWBE information will be further disaggregated by the following minority group designations as defined supra: 
a.  African American 
b.  Hispanic American 
c.  Asian American 
d.  Native American 
(6)  The county does not discriminate against any company or group of companies in its contracting and procurement activities on the basis of race, color, age, religion, sex, national origin, handicap/disability or veteran status. The SLBE program does not propose any numeric goals determined by the rate of participation of minorities or women, but will require that this information be reported. The program is designed to include all segments of the county's business community by increasing the competitiveness and profitability of all small businesses as defined within this program. 
(e)  Program Goals. The contract compliance division will set contract goals for SLBEs on a contract by contract basis for each specific prime contract with subcontracting possibilities. Contract goals for SLBEs based inside the county may be set separately from contract goals set for SLBEs based outside the county. 
SLBE participation is counted as follows: 
(1)  Once a firm is determined to be an eligible SLBE, in accordance with this policy, the total dollar value of the contract awarded to the SLBE is counted toward the applicable SLBE goals. 
(2)  The county or a contractor may count toward its SLBE goals a portion of the total dollar value of a contract with an eligible joint venture equal to the percentage of the ownership and contractual commitment to the SLBE partner in the joint venture. 
(3)  SLBE performance of a "commercially useful function" and SLBEs as contractors: 
a.  The county or a contractor may count toward its SLBE goal only expenditures to SLBEs that perform a "commercially useful function" in the work of a contract. An SLBE is considered to perform a "commercially useful function" when it is responsible for execution of a distinct element of the work of a contract and carrying out its responsibilities by actually performing, managing, and supervising the work involved. To determine whether an SLBE is performing a commercially useful function, the county or a contractor shall evaluate the amount of work subcontracted, industry practices, and other relevant factors. 
b.  Consistent with normal industry practices, SLBEs may enter into subcontracts. If an SLBE contractor subcontracts a significantly greater portion of the work of the contract than would be expected on the basis of normal industry practices, the SLBE shall be presumed not to be performing a commercially useful function. The SLBE may present evidence to rebut this presumption to the county. 
(4)  The county or a contractor may count toward its SLBE goals 50 percent of its expenditures for materials and supplies obtained from SLBE regular dealers and 100 percent of such expenditures to a manufacturer, provided that the SLBE assumes the actual and contractual responsibility for the provision of the materials and supplies as follows: 
a.  For purposes of this section, a manufacturer is a firm that operates or maintains a store, warehouse, or other establishment in which the materials or supplies required for the performance of the contract are bought, kept in stock, and regularly sold to the public in the usual course of business. To be a regular dealer, the firm must engage in, as its principal business, and in its own name, the purchase and sale of the products in question. A regular dealer in such bulk items as steel, cement, gravel, stone, and petroleum products need not keep such products in stock, if it owns or operates distribution equipment. Brokers and packagers shall not be regarded as manufacturers or regular dealers within the meaning of this section. 
b.  The county or a contractor may count toward its SLBE goals the following expenditures to SLBE firms that are not manufacturers or regular dealers: 
1.  The fees or commissions charged for providing a bona fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services and assistance in the procurement of essential personnel, facilities, equipment, materials or supplies required for performance of the contract, provided that the fee or commission is determined by the county to be reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services. 
2.  The fees charged for delivery of materials and supplies required on a job site (but not the cost of the materials and supplies themselves) when the hauler, trucker, or delivery service is not also the manufacturer of, or a regular dealer in, the materials and supplies, provided that the fee is determined by the county to be reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services. The fees or commissions charged for providing any bonds or insurance specifically required for the performance of the contract, provided that the fee or commission is determined by the county to be reasonable and not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services. 
(f)  Eligible firms. 
(1)  Requirements. To be eligible for certification as a SLBE, each applicant must: 
a.  Demonstrate that the firm's gross revenues or number of employees averaged over the past three years, inclusive of any affiliates as defined by 13 C.F.R. § 121.103, et al. does not exceed the size standards as defined pursuant to 13 C.F.R. §121.201 et al.; 
b.  Submit a certification of the net worth of each owner of the firm; 
c.  Demonstrate that the net worth of each owner does not exceed $750,000.00, exclusive of principal residence and the value of the SLBE; 
d.  Provide information regarding the ethnicity and gender of its original owners; 
e.  Demonstrate that the firm is located or has an office in the county. 
(2)  Certification process. 
a.  A business seeking certification as a SLBE must submit an application to the county on the prescribed form, affirming under penalty of perjury that the business qualifies as a county SLBE. 
b.  If requested by the county, the applicant must provide any and all materials and information necessary to demonstrate active participation in the control, operation, and management of the business. 
c.  The county will certify the applicant as a SLBE or provide the applicant with written justification of denial of certification within 90 days after the date the county receives a satisfactorily completed application from the applicant. 
d.  The county's staff will review and evaluate applications, and may reject an application based on one or more of the following:. 
1.  The applicant does not meet the requirements of the definition of a SLBE; 
2.  The application is not satisfactorily completed; 
3.  The application contains false information; 
4.  The applicant does not provide required information in connection with the certification review conducted by the county; 
e.  The county may develop partnerships with government agencies and other organizations to identify appropriate businesses and assist these businesses in obtaining certification. 
(3)  Protests. An applicant may protest the county's denial of its application for certification by filing a written protest with the county within 30 days after the date of the notice of the disposition to the applicant. The CCD will then prepare a recommendation for review by the contract compliance manager. The Director of Central Services will initiate an administrative investigation and conduct a hearing on the matter. All review decisions of the county are final. 
(4)  Recertification. 
a.  The certification is valid for a two-year period beginning on the date the county certified the applicant as a SLBE concern. 
b.  Upon expiration of the two-year period, a business that desires recertification must: 
1.  Return a completed recertification form as provided by the county; and 
2.  Comply with the requirements specified in this section that apply to the certification process. 
(5)  Revocation. The county shall revoke the certification of a business if it is determined that a business does not meet the definition of a SLBE or that the business fails to provide requested information in connection with a certification review conducted by the county. Prior to taking formal action, the county staff shall provide the business with written notice of the proposed revocation. The CCD shall then prepare a recommendation regarding the proposed revocation for review by the central services director. The decision of the central services director is final. 
(6)  Certification reviews. 
a.  Clayton County will conduct random certification reviews of certified businesses by auditing them to verify that the information submitted by a business is accurate, and that the business remains eligible after certification has been granted. Certification is subject to revocation if it is determined that a business does not qualify as the county SLBE under the terms of this program. Certification reviews may be conducted for any business for which the county determines a certification review is warranted. 
b.  Businesses subject to certification reviews must provide the county with any information requested to verify the certification eligibility of the business. 
(g)  Small local business enterprise directory. The CCD will create an SLBE directory that lists SLBEs categorized by types of firms to facilitate identifying businesses with capabilities relevant to a particular specification. Each business listing will contain the business name, contact person, address, phone number, legal structure of the business, and details concerning the company's business specialties. National Institute of Governmental Purchasing (NIGP) Codes will be identified for each company. The directory will be continuously updated and maintained on the computer and on hard copy. In compiling this directory, the CCD will identify and certify as many SLBEs as possible that have the potential of doing business with the county. The county will maintain and have available an updated SLBE directory and source list(s) for each bid/proposal solicitation to facilitate identifying SLBEs with capabilities relevant to general contracting requirements and to particular solicitations. CCD will make the directory and source list(s) available to bidders and proposers in their efforts to meet the SLBE requirements. 
(h)  Procedures to ensure that SLBEs have an equitable opportunity to compete for contracts and subcontracts. 
(1)  Procedures to ensure opportunities. Specific affirmative procedures to be utilized by the contract compliance division to ensure maximum practicable opportunities for SLBE participation include the following: 
a.  Assist SLBE in obtaining insurance and surety bonds where necessary in the performance of contracts, including but not limited to: 
1.  Packaging contracts so that dollar amounts do not require bonding; 
2.  Encouraging prime contractors to waive bonding or assist SLBE subcontractors in obtaining bonding; 
3.  Encouraging staged bonding where feasible, when bonding is carried over from one project stage to the next; and 
4.  Relaxing bonding requirements for projects less than $25,000.00; 
b.  Encourage the formation of joint ventures among SLBEs and between SLBEs. The county's contract compliance staff will assist prime contractors in identifying interested SLBEs for subcontracts; 
c.  Provide information on the county's organization and contractual needs and offer instructions on bid specifications, procurement policy, procedures, and general bidding requirements; 
d.  Provide specifications and requests for proposals to the SLBE community in a timely manner to allow SLBEs adequate time to develop responsible and responsive bids, quotations, and proposals. In instances where the cost of obtaining specifications or requests for proposal is prohibitive, copies of the material will be made available at no charge to SLBE development agencies. CCD will allow a reasonable amount of time for completion of bids and proposals. Except in the case of emergency needs, the minimum time allowed for completion of bids will be 15 days; 
e.  Establish prorated payment and delivery schedules where feasible, to minimize cash flow problems faced by small firms. The county will provide guidance to SLBE contractors regarding maintenance of positive flow in order that current obligations can be met; 
f.  Use the least complicated bid forms appropriate for each procurement solicitations 
g.  Hold pre bid conferences to explain SLBE requirements as well as forms that must be submitted with a bid or proposal;

m.  Inform SLBEs of bid notices and specifications related to their capabilities by placing bid notices in major local newspapers, and other periodicals. Bid notices will also be sent to local trade associations, technical assistance agencies, economic development groups, and SLBEs with capabilities relevant to the bid notice as identified by the county's SLBE data bank. Bid specifications will be made available to SLBE contractor associations and technical assistance agencies. Lists of potential firms bidding as primes are also available to SLBEs; and 
(2)  Direct assistance to SLBEs. The CCD will assist SLBEs in overcoming barriers to program participation. This assistance will be offered directly by the county, as well as by referral to other assistance agencies through established, comprehensive, and continuous programs. Businesses requiring management and technical assistance will be identified through a questionnaire, personal experience with these businesses, and requests for assistance. 
The CCD will offer the following assistance directly to SLBEs: 
a.  The CCD will provide information on the county's contractual requirements and projected procurement opportunities.

f.  Information on the county's SLBE program will be disseminated through written materials, seminars, workshops, and specialized assistance to individual firms. 
(i)  Methods by which the county will require contractors and subcontractors to comply with applicable SLBE requirements. The CCD staff is available to assist contractors and subcontractors in implementing this program. As a standard procedure, such assistance includes: 
(1)  Clear identification of the county's SLBE provisions in all the county solicitations; 
(2)  Pre-proposal/bid conference to explain the county's SLBE program; 
(3)  Identification of certified SLBEs per the county's solicitation including a list of certified SLBE available to all document holders; 
(4)  Lists of document holders made available to interested SLBEs, as well as CCD staff available to assist bidders/proposers in developing their SLBE programs; 
(5)  County staff's monitoring SLBE participation levels on projects throughout the duration of a contract. Contractors violating contract provisions regarding SLBE participation are subject to sanctions, including contract termination. 
(j)  Means to ensure that competitors make good faith efforts to meet SLBE contract goals. 
(1)  For all contracts for which contract goals have been established, the county shall in the solicitation inform competitors that the competitors will be required to submit SLBE participation information to the county and that the award of the contract will be conditioned upon satisfaction of the requirements established by the county. The apparent successful competitor shall submit, at the time of the bid opening or proposal review, the following information: 
a.  The name and address of SLBE firms that will participate in the contract; 
b.  The description of the work each named SLBE will perform; and 
c.  The dollar amount of participation by each named SLBE firm. 
(2)  If the SLBE participation submitted by the competitor does not meet the SLBE contract goals, the competitor must submit evidence demonstrating that "good faith efforts" were made to meet the goals. To determine sufficient "good faith efforts" to meet the SLBE contract goal, a bidder/proposer shall document the steps it has taken to obtain SLBE participation, including but not limited to the following: 
a.  Attendance at a pre-bid meeting, if any, scheduled by the county to inform SLBEs of subcontracting opportunities under a given solicitation; 
b.  Advertisement in general circulation media, trade association publications, and other media for at least 15 days before bids or proposals are due; 
c.  Written notification to SLBEs that their interest in the contract is solicited; 
d.  Efforts made to select portions of the work proposed to be performed by SLBEs in order to increase the likelihood of achieving the stated goal; 
e.  Good faith efforts to negotiate with SLBEs for specific sub bids, including, at a minimum: 
1.  The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of SLBEs that were contacted; 
2.  A description of the information provided to SLBEs regarding the plans and specifications for portions of the work to be performed; and 
3.  A statement of why additional agreements with SLBEs were not reached. 
4.  Concerning each SLBE, the competitor contacted but rejected as unqualified, the reasons for the competitor's conclusion; and 
5.  Efforts made to assist the SLBEs contacted that needed assistance in obtaining bonding or insurance required by the competitor or the county. 
(3)  To determine whether a competitor that has failed to meet SLBE goals may be awarded the contract, the county will determine whether the efforts the bidder/proposer made to obtain SLBE participation were "good faith efforts." Efforts that are merely pro forma are not "good faith efforts" to meet the goals. In order to award a contract to a bidder/proposer that has failed to meet SLBE contract goals, the county will determine whether the bidder/proposer actively and aggressively made efforts to meet the county's SLBE goals. Competitors that fail to meet SLBE goals and fail to demonstrate "good faith efforts" shall not be eligible to be awarded the contract. 
(4)  To ensure that all obligations under contracts awarded to SLBEs are met, the County shall review the contractor's SLBE involvement efforts during the performance of the contract. The contractor shall bring to the attention of the county any situation in which regularly scheduled progress payments are not made to SLBE subcontractors. 
(k)  Outreach to SLBEs. Information dissemination and communication with SLBEs is an integral part of the county's SLBE program. As a part of its outreach program, the CCD will solicit input from representatives of SLBEs, trade associations and community organizations. This input will serve several important functions, including: 
(1)  Providing information to identify additional SLBE firms; 
(2)  Assisting in refining SLBE Program goals and procedures; and 
(3)  Providing an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the county's SLBE program. 
(l)  Procedures to require that participating SLBEs are identified by name by competitors for contracts. The CCD shall indicate, in solicitations for contracts that provide opportunities for SLBE participation, goals for the use of SLBE firms. Solicitations shall require all bidders/proposers to submit a written assurance of meeting the goals in their bids or proposals. Bids must also include a proposed schedule of SLBE participation that lists the names of SLBE subcontractors, a description of the work each is to perform, and the dollar value of each proposed SLBE subcontract. If the SLBE participation does not meet the SLBE contract goals, the bidders/proposers must submit sufficient information and evidence demonstrating that the bidder/proposer made "good faith efforts" to meet the goals. Bidders/proposers are required to submit this information prior to the issuance of the notice to proceed and bidders and proposers are so informed at the time of solicitation. Agreements between a bidder/proposer and a SLBE in which the SLBE promises not to provide subcontracting quotations to other bidders/proposers shall be prohibited. 
(m)  Maintenance of records and reports. 
(1)  Records. 
a.  The CCD will maintain an electronic monitoring and reporting system which tracks the progress of the county's SLBE program. At a minimum, this electronic record keeping system will identify and assess SLBE contract awards, prime contractors' progress in achieving SLBE subcontract goals, and other efforts to assist SLBEs. Specifically, the CCD will maintain records showing: 
1.  Procedures that have been adopted to comply with the county's requirements; 
2.  Awards to SLBEs, including names of contractors and subcontractors, nature of the work/services to be performed, and the percentage of SLBE participation per contract. To assist in this effort, the CCD will obtain regular reports from prime contractors on their progress in meeting contractual SLBE obligations and specific efforts to identify and award contracts to SLBEs. 
(2)  Reports. 
a.  The CCD shall compile data and prepare reports including, but not limited to the following: 
1.  The copies of direct mailings to SLBEs; 
2.  Pre-bid conference information as it relates to the county's SLBE provisions; 
3.  Requests for assistance from SLBEs interested in bidding/proposing on the county's contracts and subcontracts; 
4.  Workshops, seminars and training programs conducted for SLBEs; and 
5.  Efforts to assist SLBEs in acquiring bonding and insurance. 
b.  The CCD will submit, at least, annual SLBE reports to the Director of Central Services. These reports shall include at a minimum: 
1.  The number of contracts awarded to SLBEs; 
2.  A description of the general categories of contracts awarded to SLBEs; 
3.  The dollar value of contracts awarded to SLBEs; 
4.  The percentage of the dollar value of all contracts awarded to SLBE during the preceding quarter; and an indication of whether the percentage met or exceeded the SLBE goals specified per contract. 
(Ord. No. 2017-45, § 1, 6-6-17) 
Sec. 2-150. - Procurement non-discrimination program. 
(a)  MWBE certification. Certification is the qualifying process that ensures that a particular business is a MWBE that performs a commercially useful function. Certification assures that interested MWBEs have the proper ownership, control, and management as defined in the program. Current contact information about the certifying entity shall be maintained by the CCD and provided to interested persons upon request. 
(b)  Reciprocal certification. Subject to the approval of the director of the central services, the county may accept certification of a MWBE from another government or private entity having certification standards at least as stringent as those created in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2017-45, § 1, 6-6-17) 
Sec. 2-151. - Benchmarks. 
(a)  Definition and purpose. The county has a compelling interest in providing equal business opportunities for all persons wishing to do business with it. Therefore, the county will monitor and track MWBE availability and participation in the procurement process through benchmarks. Benchmarks are not quotas, but a method enabling the county to compare the participation of MWBEs in the procurement process with expected participation rates based on the availability of MWBEs within the MSA. 
(b)  Procedure for establishing benchmarks. The CCD shall establish and recommend proposed benchmarks to the Director of Central Services semiannually. The CCD shall evaluate the levels of MWBE participation for the county government's overall procurement program. As part of the review, the CCD may consider data regarding MWBE participation for the preceding three fiscal years for a more accurate portrayal of MWBE participation. The CCD shall review available MWBE totals and percentages for the MSA that shall be reported in ranges showing expected MWBE participation rates on county government projects for each procurement sector based on MWBE availability within the MSA. MWBE availability shall be determined in accordance with current legal, economic, statistical and social science standards. The contract compliance manager shall consult with the contracts administrator in developing the benchmarks. The contract compliance manager may employ one or more qualified consultants each year to assist the CCD in determining MWBE availability. Benchmarks during the first year of the program shall be based on data compiled in the county disparity study, a copy of which shall be placed on file in the office of the Director of Central Services. 
(c)  Comment period.

The Director shall determine whether a particular item or category of personal property can no longer be used advantageously by the County and has therefore become unserviceable after conferring with the head of the user department desiring to sell the property. The Board of Commissioners may establish criteria establishing unserviceability for categories of personal property which may become unserviceable on a regular, frequently recurring basis, and may delegate to the Director the determination of whether a particular commodity meets the criteria of unserviceability for its category.

This prohibition shall not apply to the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption hereunder to the registered guests of any hotel or motel in their designated rooms. 
(Code 1973, § 2-3-65) 
Sec. 6-161. - Adult entertainment. 
(a)  Findings; public purpose. Based on the experiences of other urban counties, including but not limited to this county, Fulton County, and Richmond County, Georgia; and other urban municipalities, including but not limited to Atlanta and Smyrna, Georgia, Austin, Texas, Los Angeles, California, and Indianapolis, Indiana, which experiences are relevant to the problems faced by this county; and based on the Austin City Study from Austin, Texas, and other opinions proffered by the county's police department and court personnel, the board of commissioners takes note of the well-known and self-evident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country. 
(1)  It is the finding of the board of commissioners that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in so-called "nude bars" or establishments offering so-called "nude entertainment" or "adult entertainment," leads to an increase in criminal activity, and economic blight and diminution in property values of the surrounding areas. 
(2)  Among the acts of criminal activity behavior identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct, prostitution, solicitation, drug trafficking, drug use and corruption of public officials. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described. 
(3)  Accordingly, it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to reduce the adverse impact of adult entertainment establishments by limiting the number of such uses, so as to reduce the negative impacts of adult entertainment establishments upon other business uses, neighborhood property values, residential areas and public and semipublic uses, to insure that adult entertainment establishments do not impede development, redevelopment and neighborhood revitalization efforts. 
(4)  The purpose of this section is to prohibit certain types of attire, conduct and activity in the form of adult entertainment within establishments licensed to serve alcoholic beverages, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed. However, it is recognized that the prohibition of adult entertainment cannot de facto be inclusive, otherwise a protected form of expression would vanish. As to establishments serving alcoholic beverages and offering adult entertainment, this section represents a balancing of competing interests: reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the prohibition of adult entertainment in establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. 
Therefore, the prohibition of adult entertainment in establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to minimize the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcoholic beverages and provide adult entertainment. To that end, this section is hereby adopted. 
(b)  Definitions. 
(1)  Adult entertainment means any form of entertainment that features live performances by topless and/or bottomless dancers, go-go dancers, strippers or similar entertainers, where such performances are distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas.

The claim shall be audited. If the claim is approved by the county, the excess amount paid the county may be credited on amounts then due and payable from the licensee by whom it was paid, or his administrators or executors. When it is determined by the department of community development that the overpayment results from an error by the licensee, the cost of the audit shall be deducted from the credit.

Such building or structure movement may only take place between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., Monday through Thursday. 
(b)  Penalty for violation of article. Any person violating the provisions of this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punished in accordance with section 1-12 of this Code.

Sec. 18-82. - Moving permits. 
(a)  Permit. It shall be unlawful to move any house or other structure onto any vacant land in the unincorporated area of the county without first obtaining a permit therefore as prescribed in this division. 
(b)  Application. Any person desiring a permit required by this division shall file an application therefore with the county, together with a nonrefundable permit fee of $150.00. 
(c)  Application procedure; requirements. 
(1)  Any person who desires to move along county maintained roads a house, or other building or buildings, or structure into, out of, or through the county shall first make application to the department of community development for an escort permit, such application to be made at least two calendar days prior to the date of movement. 
(2)  The applicant shall certify the routing of the movement, the date and time of the movement, the tonnage weight of the loaded vehicle or vehicles moving the house, or other building or buildings, or structure and the safety precautions to be utilized in the protection of personal and property rights of others during such movement. The county official may require additional information and/or safety precautions if, in his/her judgment, he/she does not believe the moving plan to be feasible or that the necessary safety precautions are being taken. if he/she does disapprove, he/she may require that a different routing and/or additional safety precautions be taken in order to protect the personal and property rights of individuals. 
(3)  The applicant must, upon making application, give the width, length and height of the building to be moved. No routing will be approved for movement without assurance that the movement can be made without disturbing or damaging obstructions on the sides or above the route to be taken. If there are any road signs, mailboxes, overhead wiring, traffic lights, traffic signals, bridges, or other obstacles on the route chosen, it shall be the duty of the applicant to ensure that the building or structure that is being moved shall clear all of those obstructions without damage. 
(4)  Any person who desires to move along county maintained roads a house, or other building or buildings, or structure into, out of, or through the county shall post with the department of community development as cash bond in the sum of $750.00. Such bond shall be used to repair, replace or otherwise compensate the county or any citizens of the county damaged by the moving of a house, or other building or buildings, or structure through the county. However, nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of any person to $750.00. If, after 15 days from the receipt of a notice of claim for damages to the mover, the mover fails to respond, the county official may, at his/her discretion, use such cash bond to replace, repair or otherwise compensate the person for damages caused by the movement of the house, or other building or buildings, or structure. The amount of cash bond expended shall be deposited by the mover within ten-days' notice by the county official to maintain the cash bond at the minimum of $750.00. Failure to post the cash bond and maintain the cash bond at $750.00 shall result in the denial of any and all applications for moving along county maintained roads a house, or other building or buildings, or structure into or through the county. This bond shall be refunded upon written notification from the person that they are ceasing to do business in the county. 
(5)  The applicant shall provide to the department of community development a certification from the county tax commissioner, and the taxing authorities of any applicable municipality that all ad valorem property taxes assessed against the building structure to be moved have been paid in full. In the event the current year's property taxes have not been assessed and/or billed, the applicant or property owner shall cause to be paid to the tax commissioner, and any taxing authority of an applicable municipality, an amount of property taxes assessed against the property to be moved equal to 80 percent of the amount assessed and/or paid on the property for the year immediately preceding the current year. Any payment caused to be made by the applicant or property owner in accordance with this section which is in excess of the finally determined tax liability shall be refunded to the applicant or property owner as the case may be. If the amount finally determined to be the tax liability for the property exceeds the amount paid under this section, the applicant or property owner shall be liable for the amount of the difference between the amount paid and the amount owed. In no event shall a moving permit be issued to an applicant to move any house, or other building or buildings, or structure through the county until the certification required by this section is tendered by the applicant. An applicant may have his business license suspended in the event any amounts provided to be paid under this section are due and owing to the county tax commissioner and/or taxing authorities of any applicable municipality. 
(d)  Premoving inspection fee. If the house, or other building or buildings, or structure is to be relocated to a site within the unincorporated area of the county, such house, or other building or buildings, or structure must be inspected by a county official prior to its removal from the original site. The purpose of this inspection is to determine if such house, or other building or buildings, or structure meets all applicable code standards of the county. If such house, or other building or buildings, or structure cannot be modified so as to comply with all applicable codes of the county, such house, or other building or buildings, or structure may not be moved into the county. The fee for this inspection shall be $150.00. 
(e)  Denial of permit. All applications for moving permits shall be checked by the county officials as to routing, and no permit shall be granted where the width of the building exceeds 30 feet or exceeds the right-of-way width of the public road, street or thoroughfare. 
(f)  Relocation moving permits to be approved only by the governing authority; criteria; inspections. All applications for moving permits where the house, or other building or buildings, or structure being moved is to be relocated in the unincorporated area of the county shall be submitted to the board of commissioners of the county by the county official prior to any permit being issued. The board of commissioners, upon hearing an application, shall take into consideration all the factors involved, including the relocation site, the buildings in the community where the relocation site is located, and all other matters pertinent to compatibility and feasibility of the proposed house, or other building or buildings, or structure relocation, so as not to disturb the overall values of the community. Any house, or other building, or buildings, or structure that is to be relocated in the county must have an inspection before it is moved, and the county official shall make his/her recommendation to the board of commissioners as to whether or not is meets all of the standards of the county zoning laws, building codes, and other related subjects. If the board of commissioners elects to award the relocation moving permit, once it is relocated it must meet the requirements of the current adopted codes and ordinances of the county for a new structure prior to occupancy and within 90 days from the date it is relocated. 
(g)  Additional fees for relocation moving inspections. In addition to all other fees required by this article, including the escort permit fee, the application fee referred to in subsection (b) of this section, and the pre-moving inspection fee referred to in subsection (d) of this section, an additional $150.00 shall be charged for the post-moving inspection which shall occur prior to the reconstruction of such house, or other building or buildings, or structure. 
(h)  Prearrangement on clearance of utility lines prior to permit being issued. The applicant for the permit shall give satisfactory arrangements to the county officials as to the arrangements being made with the various utility companies for the clearance of utility lines along the entire route of the proposed movement. 
(i)  Penalty for division violation. Any person who violates the provisions of this division shall be charged with a violation, and the board of commissioners, after hearing the complaint and all of the evidence, if they find that in fact the division has been violated, may enter an order requiring compliance and, in addition, may refuse to grant any further permits to such person. 
(j)  Submission of plans and specifications; conformity with ordinances and resolutions. No permit to move a structure into the unincorporated area of the county required by this division shall be issued until the person desiring the permit to move such house, or other building or buildings, or structure shall have submitted plans and specifications showing the proposed additions or changes to be made on the house, or other building or buildings, or structure including foundation plans, plans for paving proposed driveways, if any, types of materials to be used in additions or changes, the proposed location of the plat of land; any and all pertinent information required for new construction, where applicable, shall likewise be given. Ordinances and resolutions applicable to new construction shall be complied with as nearly as practicable in applying for permits to move the house, or other building or buildings, or structure onto vacant land in the unincorporated area of the county and in improving the house, or other building or buildings, or structure moved onto vacant land in the unincorporated area of the county. 
(k)  Public notice of hearing on permit application. Upon filing of an application for a permit required by this division, the county official shall post upon the land on which the house, or other building or buildings, or structure is to be moved a sign of not less than 12 square feet, which shall display thereon the fact that application has been filed to move the house, or other building or buildings, or structure on such land, the type of structure proposed and that a public hearing will be held before the board of commissioners on a day certain, not less than ten nor more than 30 days from the date of filing the application, at which hearing all parties interested in such matter would have the right to appear and be heard.

Sec. 22-116. - Findings; public purpose. 
Based upon the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities within the Atlanta metropolitan area, which experiences are relevant to the problems encountered by the county, and based upon the evidence and testimony of certain citizens of the county, the board of commissioners takes note of the notorious and self-evident conditions attendant to certain establishments offering massage treatment and related services. Moreover, it is the findings of the board of commissioners that, under certain circumstances, the provision of unregulated massage services may beget criminal behavior and tend to create undesirable community conditions. Furthermore, where such resulting illicit or illegal activities are present, they have a deleterious effect upon the quality of life in neighborhoods, commercial districts and urban life in general. Accordingly, the board of commissioners deems it in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the county to reduce the adverse impact of certain undesirable massage therapists and massage establishments by providing reasonable regulations pertinent to their operation. To this end, this article is hereby adopted.

Based upon the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities within the Atlanta metropolitan area, which experiences are relevant to the issues and concerns encountered by Clayton County, and based upon the evidence and testimony of certain citizens of Clayton County, the board of commissioners takes note of the desire of certain individuals to engage in the landing of aircraft for business, recreation, and other purposes.

Chapter 25 - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 
ARTICLES I—IV. - RESERVED 

Secs. 25-1—25-359. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE V. - STORMWATER UTILITY 

Sec. 25-360. - Findings. 
The Board of Commissioners of Clayton County makes the following findings: 
(1)  Stormwater management is needed throughout Clayton County. While specific service and system demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within Clayton County is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
(2)  Addressing the stormwater management needs in Clayton County is essential to protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. Provision of stormwater management programs and systems results in both service and benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of Clayton County in a variety of ways. 
(3)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff can result in flooding, streambank and ditch erosion, property damage and degradation of water quality, aquatic habitat and biological communities. Failure to manage these impacts can put Clayton County's ability to receive state and federal grants and permits at risk. 
(4)  The volume and quantity of stormwater generated by a development has been proven to be most closely associated with the amount of impervious surface on the property, therefore, the square footage of impervious surface is the most appropriate factor for calculating stormwater utility fees. 
(5)  Clayton County, Forest Park, Jonesboro, Lake City, Lovejoy, Morrow, and Riverdale, presently own and operate stormwater management systems which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by these entities, and of additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the entities to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems in Clayton County in concert with the management of other water resources in the county. In order to do so, there must be adequate and stable funding for Clayton County's Stormwater Management Program's operating needs and capital. 
(6)  The feasibility report submitted to the county, cities, and Clayton County Water Authority (CCWA) properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems, needs, goals, program priorities and funding opportunities of the stormwater utility. 
(7)  As a result, the county's governing authority finds that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering storm water management services and the county's governing authority finds that a utility fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding storm water management services in Clayton County. 
(Ord. No. 2006-44, Pt. 1, 3-21-06) 
Sec. 25-361. - Definitions. 
The following definitions shall apply to this article. Any word or phrase not defined below but otherwise defined in the Code of Ordinances shall be given that meaning. All other words or phrases shall be given their common ordinary meaning unless the context clearly requires otherwise. 
Credit shall mean a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater system or facility or the provision of a service or activity by property owner, which system, facility, service, or activity reduces the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities. The basis of such credits, if granted, will be defined by a specific written agreement at the determination of the stormwater official in accordance with the stormwater utility. 
Customer shall mean all persons or entities to whom the stormwater service charge is billed. 
Detached dwelling unit shall mean developed land containing one structure which is not attached to another dwelling and which contains one or more bedrooms, with a bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one family. Detached dwelling units may include houses, manufactured homes, and mobile homes located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Developed land may be classified as a detached dwelling unit despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, or small storage buildings, or the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional impervious areas such as parking spaces, playgrounds, or structures or additions to the building which are used as offices, storage facilities, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship, or similar non-residential uses. Detached dwelling unit shall not include developed land containing: structures used primarily for non-residential purposes, manufactured homes and mobile homes located within manufactured home or mobile home parks where the land is owned by others than the owners of the manufactured homes or mobile homes, or multiple dwelling unit residential properties. 
Developed land means real property which has been altered from its "natural" state by addition of any improvements, such as grading, paving, compaction, construction of structures or impervious surfaces greater than 200 square feet, or drainage works so that hydrologic response of the property is changed from that which would occur in the natural undeveloped conditions. For new construction, property shall be considered developed pursuant to this ordinance upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or upon completion of construction or final inspection if no such certificate is issued. 
Hydrologic response of a property is the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. It is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious area; the size, shape, topographic, vegetative, and geologic conditions of a property; antecedent moisture conditions; and groundwater conditions on a property. 
Impervious surfaces shall mean those areas, which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development. The following types of surfaces will be considered "impervious surfaces" for purposes of the stormwater utility: the projected area of buildings; asphalt-, concrete-, brick-, or stone-paved areas; improved vehicular drives and parking areas; compacted gravel and soil surfaces; fabric or plastic coverings; and other surfaces that prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff or that change the hydrologic response of the property that existed prior to development. 
Multi-family residential shall mean developed land where more than one attached or detached residential dwelling units are located, including, but not limited to apartment houses, condominiums, townhomes, attached single-family homes, boarding houses, group homes, hotels and motels, retirement centers, and other structures in which more than one family groups commonly and normally reside or could reside. 
Service charges shall mean the stormwater management service charges applicable to a parcel of developed land, which charge shall be reflective of the service provided by CCWA stormwater utility. The charge shall be used to fund the Clayton County Stormwater Utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and systems. Service charges are based on measurable parameters that influence the stormwater utility's cost of providing services and facilities, with the most important factor being the amount of impervious area on each parcel of land. The use of impervious area as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat-rate charges for one or more classes of similarly-situated properties whose impact on the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater service charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management of that property, including but not limited to charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects and on-site stormwater control systems, and enhanced level of stormwater services above those normally provided by CCWA. 
Single-family residential shall mean a developed lot containing one dwelling structure with its principal use being residential. 
Stormwater development guidelines are those guidelines established by CCWA which specify approved design criteria, construction materials and construction methods for components of the stormwater management system. 
Stormwater management system means any one or more of the various devices used in the collection, treatment, or conveyance of storm, flood or surface drainage waters, including all manmade structures or natural watercourse for the conveyance or transportation of runoff, such as: detention areas, lakes, berms, swales, improved watercourses, open channels, streams, culverts, pipes, catch basins inlets; collection, or drainage. 
Stormwater official is the CCWA general manager or his/her appointee that has direct responsibility for the management of the CCWA stormwater utility. 
Stormwater unit (SU) shall mean the unit of measure which provides the basis for comparing the runoff generated by customer's developed land with that generated by another's. An SU shall be the average impervious coverage of a statistical sampling of single-family residential lots in Clayton County. A stormwater unit has been determined through engineering and analysis to be 2,950 square feet of impervious surface. This unit will be used to determine and compute the service charge for all developed land served by the CCWA stormwater utility. 
Stormwater utility guidebook shall mean the document that defines the basis for the stormwater utility, policies and procedures for operating the utility, and other necessary information determined to help document how the utility was developed and how it is operated. 
Undeveloped land is land in its unaltered natural state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have no pavement, asphalt, or compacted gravel surfaces or structures in excess of 200 square feet which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state. 
(Ord. No. 2006-44, Pt. 1, 3-21-06) 
Sec. 25-362. - Establishment of a utility. 
(a)  Clayton County hereby consents to the establishment of a county-wide stormwater utility (the "stormwater utility") by the CCWA which shall be responsible for stormwater management county-wide, and shall provide for, the management, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management systems. Specific areas of regulation and maintenance are established in the stormwater utility guidebook so long as they are not in conflict with the terms of this article or that certain intergovernmental agreement dated ____________ , as amended from time to time, between CCWA and Clayton County. 
(b)  Pursuant to the terms of this article and that certain intergovernmental agreement dated ____________ , as amended from time to time, between CCWA and Clayton County, the CCWA shall carry out and perform on behalf of Clayton County, all of Clayton County's duties and responsibilities with respect to stormwater management services, enforcement, and systems heretofore owned and operated by the county.

Design and construction of public or private stormwater management facilities will be governed by the CCWA's stormwater development guidelines which specify design criteria, construction materials and construction methods. The CCWA stormwater development guidelines will supersede any previously adopted stormwater design or construction guidelines. Additionally, the stormwater utility may accept the responsibility for the operation and maintenance of private stormwater systems only when such services have been agreed to, contracted for, and approved by the governing authority of the utility. 
(c)  The stormwater utility shall provide for inspection of private stormwater systems to ascertain that the stormwater systems are functioning as designed and approved. The MNGWPD post-development stormwater ordinance has been adopted by Clayton County, Forest Park, Jonesboro, Morrow, Lake City, Lovejoy, and Riverdale. Property owners who fail to maintain their stormwater systems will be notified of the violation. If within 30 days (or 24 hours if there is an immediate danger to public safety), no actions are taken, the CCWA may enter the property and correct the failure. The cost for the repair work may be a charge on the customer's water, sewer and stormwater bill or a lien on the property that may be placed on the tax bill. 
(d)  The CCWA owns or has rights established by written agreements which allow it to operate, maintain, improve and access those stormwater management systems and facilities which are located: 
(1)  Within public road rights-of-way and easements;

This notice shall be deemed complete and sufficient when so addressed and deposited in the United States mail with proper postage prepaid. The notice of violation shall inform the property owner that a violation of this article exists on the identified property with the description of the public nuisance, that the property owner is responsible for maintaining the identified private storm water system, that the property owner may allow the city access to the property to abate the nuisance at the expense of the property owner, and that formal enforcement action will be taken if the violation is not corrected within the time period indicated on the notice. The stormwater official shall determine a reasonable period of time for correction of the nuisance. In determining a reasonable period of time, the stormwater official shall consider the following: practicality and ease of correction; the owner's ability to correct the violation; the severity of the violation; the nature, extent, and probability of danger to the public, and other relevant factors. 
Notice, as required under this provision, shall not be required: (a) when the stormwater official determines that the public nuisance presents an imminent endangerment to persons or property; (b) when a notice of violation has been sent to the same property owner or owners for the same violation within the previous three months; or (c) when notice by certified mail cannot be effected on the owners of record. 
The notice of violation shall contain substantially the following information and may be in the following form or other appropriate form: Notice of Violation: name of owner; address of owner; description of property; inspection date; determination made by the stormwater official that the condition on the property is creating adverse conditions so as to constitute a violation of the this ordinance; describe the conditions that caused the property to be in violation and any recommended actions that may be necessary to remedy the nuisance; specify a reasonable time period to proceed and remedy the nuisance; or provide written permission to the city to enter the site and abate the nuisance at owner's expense. 
Within the reasonable period of time for compliance specified in the notice of violation, the property owner shall either abate the nuisance or file a written request with CCWA for a hearing before the stormwater official to show that the condition alleged in the notice does not exist or that such condition does not constitute a public nuisance in violation of the article. 
(c)  Any failure to meet the obligation set forth in this section shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by any damaged party or Clayton County in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the owner fails to properly abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the CCWA may enter upon the property and cause such work as is reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance with the actual cost thereof assessed against the owner or developer, if any, on a joint and several basis. From the date of the filing of such action, the CCWA shall have lien rights, which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the General Execution Docket of the Superior Court of Clayton County or city court. CCWA shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private and public property owned by entities other than the county, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance with this section.

(Ord. No. 2010-127, § 1, 6-15-10; Ord. No. 2018-23, § 3, 3-20-18) 
Sec. 38-28. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act." As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to [O.C.G.A.] § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15),(16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the state soil and water conservation commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regarding and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments onsite or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection (b)(2) of this section; 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed ; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: 
1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970," and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25 foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
(d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 2010-127, § 1, 6-15-10; Ord. No. 2018-23, §§ 4—6, 3-20-18) 
Sec. 38-29. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  General provisions. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the county without first obtaining a permit from the county department of transportation and development to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD, if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the county department of transportation and development and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) of this section. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsection 38-28(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by five copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-10. 
(3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsection 38-28(c)(15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per paragraph (6) of this subsection (b) have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the erosion and sedimentation act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsection 38-28(b) and (c) of this article or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and stormwater management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
(d)  Permits. 
(1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article any variances required by subsections 38-28(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) of this section are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article and any other articles relating to land development, as are applied to private persons, and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(6)  The local issuing authority may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the erosion and sedimentation act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
(Ord. No. 2010-127, § 1, 6-15-10; Ord. No. 2018-23, § 7, 3-20-18) 
Sec. 38-30. - Inspection and enforcement. 
(a)  The county department of transportation and development will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
(b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
(c)  The county department of transportation and development shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
(d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or the division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
(e)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program.

ARTICLE V. - POST-DEVELOPMENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT 

Sec. 38-110. - Findings. 
It is hereby determined that: 
Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment, by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas. The preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or "credits." The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits; 
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution; 
Therefore, Clayton County Board of Commissioners has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff. 
(Ord. No. 04-39, § 1, 4-6-04) 
DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 38-111.1. - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
(2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
(3)  Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum post-development stormwater management standards; 
(5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with Clayton County's Watershed Improvements through Statistical Evaluation (WISE) Model Plan; 
(6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and, 
(7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up. 
(Ord. No. 04-39, § 1, 4-6-04) 
Sec. 38-111.2. - Applicability. 
(a)  This article shall be applicable to all land development, including, but not limited to, site plan applications, subdivision applications, and grading applications, unless exempt pursuant to subsection (2) below. These standards apply to any new development or redevelopment site that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
(1)  New development that involves the creation of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activities of one acre or more; 
(2)  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more; 
(3)  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the Clayton County Director of Transportation and Development or his designee to be a hotspot land use; or, 
(4)  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in items (1) and (2) above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
(b)  The following activities are exempt from this article: 
(1)  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project; 
(2)  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
(3)  Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; and, 
(4)  Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the Clayton County Director of Transportation and Development.

ARTICLE VII. - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND ILLEGAL CONNECTION 

Sec. 38-130. - Findings. 
It is hereby determined that: 
Discharges to the Clayton County separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the Clayton County separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments. 
These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume non-stormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters. 
The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the Clayton County separate storm sewer system; 
Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the Clayton County separate storm sewer system; 
Therefore, the Clayton County Board of Commissioners adopts this article to prohibit such non-stormwater discharges to the Clayton County separate storm sewer system. It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the Clayton County separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 46-26. - Statutory authorization. 
The state legislature has in the Planning Enabling Legislation of 1957, as amended, article 9, section 5-2, part 1 of the constitution of the state, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the board of commissioners does ordain as following to be its regulations governing flood damage prevention. 
(Code 1973, § 2-26-1) 
Sec. 46-27. - Findings of facts. 
The board of commissioners hereby finds that: 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Code 1973, § 2-26-2) 
Sec. 46-28. - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protection barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Code 1973, § 2-26-3) 
Sec. 46-29. - Objectives. 
The objectives of this article are to: 
(1)  Protect human life and health; 
(2)  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects; 
(3)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and 
(7)  Ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Code 1973, § 2-26-4)

Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished and flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other provisions of this article. 
Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term includes any structure commonly referred to as a "mobile home" regardless of the date of manufacture. The term also includes parked trailers, travel trailers and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this article the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) and/or the North American Vertical Datum (NAVO) of 1988. 
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
New construction means any structure (see definition) for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after 1973 and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure. 
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after 1973. 
North American Vertical Datum (NAVO) of 1988 is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.

Permit means the permit issued by the Clayton County Department of Transportation and Development to the applicant which is required prior to undertaking any development activity. 
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle which is: 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
(3)  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by light duty truck; and 
(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
Repetitive loss means flood related damage sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
NOTE: Inclusion of this definition allows policyholders to avail ICC portion of the flood claim under the repetitive loss declaration by the community in addition to one time substantial flood damage declaration by the community. However, if adopted, the community will need to track the flood damages over the 10-year periods. 
Site means the parcel of land being developed, or the portion thereof on which the development project is located. 
Start of construction means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are not exempt from any ordinance requirements). For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means, for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building including a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
Structure means, for insurance purposes: (1) A building with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site; (2) A manufactured home ("a manufactured home," also known as a mobile home, is a structure; built on a permanent chassis, transported to its site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation); or (3) A travel trailer without wheels, built on a chassis and affixed to a permanent foundation, that is regulated under the community's floodplain management and building ordinances or laws. For the latter purpose, "structure" does not mean a recreational vehicle or a park trailer or other similar vehicle, except as described in paragraph (3) of this definition, or a gas or liquid storage tank. 
Subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land resulting in one or more new lots or building sites for the purpose, whether immediately or in the future, of sale, other transfer of ownership or land development, and includes divisions of land resulting from or made in connection with the layout or development of a new street or roadway or a change in an existing street or roadway. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to the before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. This term also includes repetitive loss. 
Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certificates, or other evidence of compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Secs. 46-56—46-65. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 3. - STANDARDS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

Sec. 46-66. - General standards. 
In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(1)  Floodway fringe. 
a.  Generally. The floodway fringe is a specific area that is located in some sections of some 100-year floodplains in which encroachments and/or developments may be allowed. All encroachments, development or construction activities within a designated floodway fringe are regulated by one or more of several different types of permits. Rules that are contained in this article, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the National Flood Insurance Program (FEMA), or other state or local laws may apply to regulations governing development in the floodway fringe area. Property owners are responsible for reviewing all regulations and obtaining the necessary permits before the various activity begins in the floodway fringe. The floodway fringe areas are only those areas designated and identified on FEMA boundary and floodway maps. These areas are normally located adjacent to the regulated floodway and also between the limits of the floodway and the outer boundary of the area of special flood hazard. The following regulations apply to earthwork that is required for fill or foundations of structures, buildings or encroachments in the floodway fringe. Other earthwork that would be associated with other approved uses of the floodway fringe will be considered and approved based upon the acceptability of the design and materials specified. Some of the other uses are open space, parks, recreational areas, vehicle parking and agricultural uses. 
b.  Earthwork. Land used for construction of any building or structure within the floodway fringe shall be raised a minimum of two vertical feet above the base flood elevation. The fill area shall include that land to be occupied by the proposed building or structure and the additional adjacent land in all directions for a distance of 20 feet beyond the building site. The fill shall be constructed of material that is free of debris and boulders and that is suitable for embankment. The fill material shall be deposited and spread in uniform layers not more than six inches in thickness. These layers shall be compacted to at least 95 percent of the maximum laboratory dry density. The fill area shall be sloped to provide adequate drainage. The area shall be stabilized to prevent erosion by seeding, sodding or other approved methods. 
(2)  Anchoring of new construction/substantial improvements. New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
(3)  Manufactured homes. Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(4)  Resistance to flood damage. New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
(5)  Methods/practices for new construction/substantial improvements. New construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
(6)  Protection of service facilities, etc., from water damage.

County public safety officer means any county police officer, deputy sheriff, the fire chief and any sworn employee of the fire department who is authorized by the fire chief to carry a firearm on duty, the warden of the county prison and any sworn employee of the prison who is authorized by the warden carry to a firearm on duty, or an investigator employed by the district attorney's office or solicitor general's office. 
Disability means a medical condition that prevents an individual from working as a county public safety officer. 
Reimbursement schedule means the dollar amount the retiring county public safety officer will reimburse the county for the cost of the weapon. For the purpose of this schedule, the age of the weapon is computed from the date the weapon was first put in service by a county public safety agency. For a weapon that is less than three years old the retiring officer shall reimburse the county 80 percent of the county's cost of the weapon but not more than $200.00. For a weapon that is three years old but less than five years old, the retiring officer shall reimburse the county 50 percent of the county's cost of the weapon but not more than $100.00. For a weapon that is five years or more in age, the retiring officer shall reimburse the county $1.00. 
Weapon means a county owned handgun issued to the public safety officer by his agency for official use as a county public safety officer. 
(b)  In recognition of the sacrifice made by our public safety officers who have served at least 15 years with the county and who retire and leave active duty under honorable conditions and in good standing, may retain their weapon and badge as part of their compensation. The retiring public safety officer shall reimburse the county for the cost of the weapon pursuant to the reimbursement schedule. Once the county receives payment, ownership of the weapon shall transfer to the retiring officer and the weapon will be removed from the county's inventory. 
(c)  When a county public safety officer leaves active duty as a result of a disability arising from a line of duty injury, such member shall be entitled as part of such officer's compensation to retain his or her weapon and badge. The county waives reimbursement in such cases and ownership of the weapon shall transfer to the officer and the weapon shall be removed from the county's inventory. 
(d)  The director of human resources is designated by the board of commissioners to act on behalf of the county in determining an employee's qualifications under this section. 
(1)  To determine if the employee meets the 15-year requirement, the director shall calculate each year of service or part thereof that the employee has served either as a county police officer, deputy sheriff, any sworn employee of the fire department who is authorized by the fire chief to carry a firearm on duty, any sworn employee of the prison who is authorized by the warden carry to a firearm on duty, or an investigator employed by the district attorney's office or solicitor general's office or any combination thereof. The total years of service must equal or exceed 15 years. This will only include years of service as a county employee, provided however that investigators for the district attorney's office who are paid in part or in whole by the state, will receive credit for each year or part thereof that they work for the county's district attorney's office. 
(2)  In addition, the director shall determine if the employee has met all other conditions of this section. 
(3)  The decision of the director of human recourses in these matters is final.

The Clayton County Board of Commissioners is concerned about the increase in criminal activity engaged in by children and the increase in criminal activity that adversely effects children, especially criminal activity which occurs at hours and/or times after which children should be at home. Clayton County has experienced tragic and violent acts, involving serious injuries and even deaths, involving children in 2005, with many of these acts occurring after the hour set out in this section for curfew. At numerous community meetings many citizens have voiced their concerns about the increase in child violence, the need to protect our children from being victims of crimes that occur after the hour set out in this section for curfew, and the need to make parents more responsible for their children. 
In an effort to keep the county drug free and the county's streets safe by reducing the numbers of crimes that are committed by and against children after the hour set out in this section for curfew, the board of commissioners finds that a child curfew ordinance is one initiative to protect children in Clayton County from being the victims, as well as perpetrators, of crime.

Income and financial status of the owner shall not be factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.G.C.A. chapter 39A of title 43, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction.

The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
d.  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials; 
e.  That the amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.

The tax commissioner shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the county whose ordinance is being enforced. Thirty days after imposition of the lien, the unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
(4)  The board of commissioners of the county may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation.

(7)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the county to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise. 
(g)  Complaints issued by the public officer pursuant to this section shall be served in the manner provided for in O.G.C.A. § 41-2-12(a) through (h).

(d)  An eligible employee shall receive 100 percent full salary benefits so long as the employee is unable to return to work and continues to be eligible for benefits under provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act, provided, however, receipt of 100 percent of full salary for each on-the-job injury shall not exceed 512 hours maximum per injury, not to exceed 512 hours per calendar year for personnel who normally work 40 hours per week, and 696 hours maximum per injury not to exceed 696 hours per calendar year for personnel who normally work a shift of 24 hours.

(i)  In no event shall the provisions of this section affect or compromise the benefits required to be provided pursuant to provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act.

Editor's note— Ord. No. 2014-288, § 1, adopted Nov. 18, 2014, repealed former Art. II, §§ 70-61—70-74 in its entirety and enacted new provisions as herein set out. Former Art. II pertained to similar subject matter and derived from the Code of 1973, §§ 2-7½-1—2-7½-3; Ord. No. 00136, § 1, adopted Dec. 5, 2000. 

Sec. 70-61. - Declaration of policy. 
It is essential to the proper government and administration of the county that the county's officials and employees covered by this article be, and give the appearance of being, independent and impartial, that public service not be used for private gain, and that there be public confidence in the integrity of the county government. Because the attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists in fact, or appears to exist, a conflict between the private interests and public responsibilities of county officials or employees, the public interest requires that the county protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate ethical standards with respect to the conduct of the officials and employees covered by this article in situations where a conflict may exist. It is also essential to the efficient operation of the county that those persons best qualified be encouraged to serve in positions of public trust. Accordingly, the standards set forth in this article must be interpreted and understood as to not unreasonably frustrate or impede the desire or inclination of those best qualified to seek and serve in public office. To that end, the officials and employees noted in this article should not, except as otherwise provided by law, be denied the opportunity available to all other citizens to acquire and maintain private, economic and other interests, except where a conflict of interest appears. The policy and purpose of this article, therefore, is to make clear those standards of ethical conduct that shall apply to the officials and employees noted in this article in the discharge of their official duties, to comport with the object of protecting the integrity of county government, and to prescribe only such essential restrictions as will not impose barriers repugnant to conscientious public service.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 70-126. - Statement of policy. 
(a)  The county government is firmly committed to providing its employees with a safe work place and promoting high standards of employee health. Consistent with the spirit and intent of this commitment, the board of commissioners has established this policy regarding alcohol and substance abuse. The board of commissioners' goal will continue to be one of establishing and maintaining a work environment that is free from the effects of alcohol and substance abuse. 
(b)  County government has several uniquely compelling interests that justify the implementation of procedures for employee alcohol and substance testing. The public has a right to expect that those who have the responsibility of providing services to taxpayers of the county are at all times both physically and mentally prepared to perform their assigned job duties. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the use of alcohol and certain substances may seriously impair an employee's physical and mental health, and thus, job performance. Where employees participate in alcohol and substance abuse, the integrity of county government and public confidence therein is destroyed. 
(c)  Therefore, in order to ensure the integrity of the county's government and to preserve public trust and confidence, the board of commissioners hereby implements an alcohol and substance abuse policy and testing program to detect prohibited alcohol and substance use by county employees.

Chain of custody means procedures to account for the integrity of each specimen by tracking its handling and storage from point of specimen collection to fine disposition of the specimen. These procedures shall require that an approved agency chain of custody form be used from time of collection or receipt by the laboratory and that upon receipt of the laboratory an appropriate chain of custody form account for the specimen within the laboratory. Chain of custody forms shall, at a minimum, include an entry documenting date and purpose each time a specimen is handled or transferred and identifying every individual in the chain of custody. 
Collection site means the medical facility designated by the county (or any alternate site authorized by this division) where individuals present themselves for the purpose of providing a specimen of their blood or urine to be analyzed for the presence of alcohol or substances. 
Collection site person means personnel under the direction of the medical facility staff or personnel employed by any alternate collection site authorized by this division, who will instruct and assist individuals at a collection site and who will receive and make an initial examination of the specimen provided by those individuals. A collection site person shall have successfully completed training to carry out this function. 
Confirmatory test means a second analytical procedure to identify the presence of a specific substance or metabolite which is independent of the initial test and which uses a different technique and chemical principle from that of the initial test in order to ensure reliability and accuracy. 
Controlled substance means those substances as defined in O.C.G.A. § 16-13-20 et seq. relating to controlled substances. For the purpose of this division, the "controlled substance" shall include marijuana as defined by O.C.G.A. § 16-13-21. 
Employee means those individuals who occupy a position in county government. 
Initial test (also known as "screening test") means an immunoassay screen to eliminate "negative" specimens from further consideration. 
Permanent record book means a permanently bound book in which identifying data on each specimen collected at a collection site is permanently recorded in the sequence of collection. 
Reasonable suspicion means that quantity or proof of evidence that is more than a hunch, but less than probable cause.

(b)  Alcohol and/or substance testing will be required of employees for which reasonable suspicion exists to believe that such employees are under the influence of alcohol or substances during assigned working hours or while otherwise on county property. Testing may be required following work-related accidents if the surrounding circumstances give rise to reasonable suspicion to believe that such employees are under the influence of alcohol or substances. 
(1)  The initial determination of whether or not reasonable suspicion exists shall be made by the department director (elected official) or by the highest ranking supervisory staff person on duty at the time. The department director (elected official) or supervisory staff person shall consult with the personnel director (or the personnel officer in his absence), when available, for the purpose of determining if an alcohol or substance test is appropriate under the circumstances. 
(2)  Following the determination that reasonable suspicion exists and an alcohol or substance test should be administered, the employee shall be immediately transported to the collection site by the employee's department director (elected official) or such designee of the department director (elected official). Following the collection procedure, the person transporting the employee shall make appropriate arrangements to transport the employee home.

(c)  When conducting reasonable suspicion, accident or probationary testing, specimens may be tested for any substance. 
(Code 1973, § 2-2-130) 
Sec. 70-152. - Specimen collection procedures. 
The following provisions outline procedures for specimen collection: 
(1)  The collection site shall have all necessary personnel, materials, equipment, facilities and supervision to provide for the collection, security, temporary storage, and shipping or transportation of specimens to a certified substance testing laboratory. 
(2)  Security procedures shall provide for the designated collection site to be secure. If a collection site facility is dedicated solely to specimen collection, it shall be secure at all times. If a facility cannot be dedicated solely to specimen collection, the portion of the facility used for such collection shall be secured during specimen collection. 
(3)  Chain of custody standardized forms shall be properly executed by authorized collection site personnel upon receipt of specimens. Handling and transportation of specimens from one authorized individual or place to another shall be accomplished through chain of custody procedures. Every effort shall be made to minimize the number of persons handling specimens. 
(4)  Procedures for collecting urine specimens shall allow individual privacy unless there is reason to believe that a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen provided. 
(5)  Collection site personnel shall take precautions to ensure that a specimen is not adulterated or diluted during the collection procedure, and that information on the specimen bottle and in the record book can identify the individual from whom the specimen was collected. 
(6)  After the specimen is collected, it shall be properly sealed and labeled. An approved chain of custody form shall be used for maintaining control and accountability of each specimen from the point of collection to final disposition of the specimen. The date and purpose shall be documented on an approved chain of custody form each time a specimen is handled or transferred and every individual in the chain shall be identified. 
(7)  If the collection site is not also the laboratory, the collection site personnel shall arrange to ship the collected specimens to the substance testing laboratory. The specimens shall be placed in containers designed to minimize the possibility of damage during shipment; and those containers shall be securely sealed to eliminate the possibility of undetected tampering. On the tape sealing the containers the collection site supervisor shall sign and enter the date specimens were sealed in the containers for shipment. The collection site personnel shall ensure that the chain of custody documentation is attached to each container sealed for shipment to the substance testing laboratory. 
(8)  Only laboratory certified by the National Institute for Drug Abuse (NIDA) to perform body fluid tests for substance abuse detection will be used. 
(Code 1973, § 2-2-131) 
Sec. 70-153. - Laboratory analysis procedures. 
The following provisions outline procedures for laboratory analyses: 
(1)  Laboratories will use only procedures approved by the National Institute for Drug Abuse (NIDA). 
(2)  The initial test shall use an immunoassay which meets the requirements of the Food and Drug Administration for commercial distribution. 
(3)  All specimens identified as positive on the initial test shall be confirmed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) techniques. All confirmations shall be by quantitative analysis. Concentrations exceeding the linear region of the standard curve shall be documented in laboratory records as "greater than highest standard curve value." 
(4)  Before any test result is reported (the results of initial tests, confirmatory tests or quality control data), it shall be reviewed and the test certified as an accurate report by the responsible individual. The report shall identify the alcohol/substances/metabolites tested for, whether positive or negative, the specimen number assigned by the collection site person and the substance testing laboratory specimen identification number. The results (positive or negative) for all specimens submitted at the same time to the laboratory shall be reported back to the personnel director. 
(5)  The department director (elected official) may request from the personnel director the results of the test. 
(6)  The laboratory shall report as negative all specimens which are negative on the initial test or negative on the confirmatory test. Only specimens confirmed positive shall be reported positive for alcohol or a specific substance. 
(7)  The personnel director may request from the laboratory and the laboratory shall provide quantitation of test results. The laboratory may transmit results to the personnel director by various electronic means (e.g., teleprinters, facsimile or computer) in a manner designed to ensure confidentiality of the information. Results may not be provided verbally by telephone. The laboratory must ensure the security of the data transmission and limit access to any data transmission, storage and retrieval system. 
(8)  The laboratory shall send to the personnel director a certified copy of the original chain of custody form signed by the individual responsible for day-to-day management of the substance testing laboratory or the individual responsible for attesting to the validity of the test reports. 
(9)  Because some analyses deteriorate or are lost during freezing and/or storage, quantitation for a retest is not subject to the specific cutoff requirement but must provide data sufficient to confirm the presence of alcohol or the substance or metabolite. 
(10)  The laboratory shall have qualified personnel available to testify in an administrative or disciplinary proceeding against an employee when that proceeding is based on positive results reported by the laboratory. 
(11)  The provisions provided for in this article shall not limit the county to the usage of only the standard test describe. Tests for other substances and tests by other valid methodologies may be made in particular cases. 
(Code 1973, § 2-2-132) 
Sec. 70-154. - Quality assurance and quality control. 
Alcohol or substance testing laboratories shall have a quality assurance program which encompasses all aspects of the testing process including, but not limited to, specimen acquisition, chain of custody, security and reporting of results, initial and confirmatory testing, and validation of analytical procedures. Quality assurance procedures shall be designed, implemented and reviewed to monitor the conduct of each step of the process of testing for substances. 
(Code 1973, § 2-2-133) 
Sec. 70-155. - Reporting and review of results. 
(a)  Review by personnel director, department director (elected official) and trained medical personnel. The personnel director shall review results in concert with the department director (elected official). An essential part of the substance testing program is the final review of results. A positive test result does not automatically identify an employee/applicant as an unauthorized alcohol or substance user. An individual with a detailed knowledge of possible alternate medical explanations is essential to the review of results. This review shall be performed in collaboration with trained medical personnel. 
(b)  Discussion of positive results with individual; assessment of disciplinary action. Prior to making a final decision to verify a positive test result, the personnel director with the department director (elected official), shall give the individual an opportunity to discuss the test results. Following verification of positive test results, and in the absence of an appropriate alternate medical explanation, the department director (elected official) shall assess appropriate disciplinary action against the employee. 
(c)  Reanalysis of samples. Should any question arise as to the accuracy or validity of positive test results, the department director (elected official), in consultation with the personnel director, is authorized to order a reanalysis of the original sample and such retests are authorized only at laboratories certified under these guidelines. 
(d)  Certification of legitimate substance use. If the laboratory determines there is a legitimate medical explanation for the positive test results, it shall be certified that the results are consistent with authorized substance use and take no further action. 
(e)  Action upon determination of scientifically insufficient results. Additionally, the laboratory, based on a review inspection report, quality control data, multiple samples and other pertinent results, may determine that the results are scientifically insufficient for further action and declare the test specimen negative. In this situation, the department director (elected official), in consultation with the personnel director, may require reanalysis of the original sample specimen before making this decision. The reanalysis may be performed by the same laboratory, or a portion of the original specimen may be sent for reanalysis to alternate laboratory. The laboratory shall assist in this review process as requested by making available the individual responsible for day-to-day management of the substance testing laboratory or other employee who is a forensic toxicologist or who has equivalent forensic experience in substance testing to provide specific consultation as required by the county. The laboratory shall report to the personnel director all findings and the scientific basis therefor.

DIVISION 4. - EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 

Sec. 70-171. - Implementation. 
The reference point and clearinghouse for the employee assistance program (EAP) will be the county's personnel department. The EAP must have proper resources to interview employees and refer them to appropriate rehabilitation/treatment programs. 
(Code 1973, § 2-2-137) 
Sec. 70-172. - Confidentiality. 
The confidentiality of the records of the employee assistance program (EAP) coordinator will be assured to further promote employee trust and confidence in the EAP. For purposes of statistical reporting, names and dates will not be released. However, the EAP coordinator shall have the obligation to advise the department director (elected official) if such employee admits to be presently impaired. The notion of confidentiality does not give an impaired employee the right to continue working simply because he has accessed the EAP. In such a situation, the department director (elected official) may relieve the employee from work duty, and the employee may seek appropriate leave benefits or some other type of action that will not label the employee as an alcohol or substance abuser. 
(Code 1973, § 2-2-138) 
Sec. 70-173. - Supervisor referral. 
The alcohol and controlled substance abuse policy allows the department director (elected official) to refer an employee to the employee assistance program (EAP) rather than suspend or terminate the employee for a violation of the policy. All referrals to the EAP will be coordinated through the personnel department. After a decision to refer the employee to the EAP has been made, the employee shall be counseled by the department director (elected official) in concert with the personnel director. At this counseling session, the policy shall be reviewed with the employee, and the employee shall sign the "employee consent and notice of referral" form. The counseling session should further provide the opportunity to review the EAP expectations and all other available alternatives to participation in the EAP. 
(Code 1973, § 2-2-139) 
Sec. 70-174. - Financing. 
Subject to approval by the board of commissioners, an outside employee assistance program (EAP) professional organization may be retained as the EAP coordinator. All expenses incident to services rendered by the EAP coordinator shall be the sole responsibility of the employee referred to the EAP. However, the county will cooperate with the employee relative to the filing of appropriate claims with the employee's health insurance provider. 
(Code 1973, § 2-2-140) 
Sec. 70-175. - Employee's participation. 
(a)  If participation in the employee assistance program (EAP) can not be accomplished during nonworking hours, an employee may utilize accumulated sick and annual leave together with any other leave benefits afforded other similarly situated employees. 
(b)  Upon their successful completion of the EAP, all employees referred to the EAP will be allowed to return to work with the reinstatement of all seniority rights and privileges previously enjoyed.

ARTICLE V. - SEXUAL HARASSMENT 

Sec. 70-196. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this article is to adopt a sexual harassment policy and to provide the procedure within which the objectives of this policy can be accomplished. Accordingly, pursuant to the guidelines of sex discrimination issued by the equal employment opportunity commission, the board of commissioners endorses the following policy. 
(Code 1973, § 2-2-15(a)) 
Sec. 70-197. - Policy statement. 
The following provisions shall constitute the county's policy regarding sexual harassment: 
(1)  It is illegal and against the policies of the county for any employee, male or female, to sexually harass another employee by: 
a.  Making unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature a condition of an employee's continued employment. 
b.  Making submission to or rejections of such conduct the basis for employment decisions affecting the employee. 
c.  Discriminating against an employee because of his or her sex. 
Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. 
(2)  No person shall threaten or insinuate, either explicitly or implicitly, that an employee's refusal to submit to sexual advances will adversely affect the employee's employment, evaluation, wages, advancement, assigned duties, shifts or any other condition of employment or career development. 
(3)  It is the responsibility of each supervisor, department director and elected official having adopted this policy to maintain the workplace free of sexual harassment. This duty includes discussing this policy with all employees and assuring them that they are not to endure insulting, degrading or exploitive sexual treatment. 
(4)  Any employee who believes he or she has been the subject of sexual harassment should report the alleged act immediately to his or her supervisor, department director, elected official or the director of personnel. Any supervisor, department director or elected official who becomes aware of or suspects sexual harassment shall immediately report such information to the director of personnel. Upon receiving a complaint, an investigation shall be undertaken immediately by the department/office in conjunction with the personnel office. Any employee who has been found after appropriate investigation to have sexually harassed another employee will be subject to disciplinary action by his or her department director or elected official from a written warning up to and including termination. 
(5)  It is recognized that the question of whether a particular action or incident is a purely personal, social relationship without discriminatory employment effect requires a factual determination based on all facts pertaining to the incident. Given the nature of this type of discrimination, it is further recognized that false accusations of sexual harassment can cause serious effects on innocent women and men. Accordingly, false accusations will result in severe disciplinary action up to and including termination. The county trusts that all employees will continue to act responsibly to establish a pleasant working environment free of sexual harassment.

ARTICLE VIII. - POLITICAL ACTIVITY 

Sec. 70-260. - Declaration, purposes, and intent. 
It is essential to the proper government and administration of the county that employees covered by this article give the appearance of being independent and impartial with respect to political activities, and that there be public confidence in such employees' neutrality and integrity. The attainment of one or more of these ends is impaired whenever there exists, or appears to exist, a conflict between the private political interests of classified employees and the public responsibilities such employees possess. Therefore, the public welfare requires that the county protect against such conflicts of interest by establishing appropriate privileges and prohibitions with respect to the conduct of political activities. It is also essential to the efficient operation of the county that those persons best qualified be encouraged to serve in positions of public trust or be allowed to support those who will serve in positions of public trust. Accordingly, the privileges and prohibitions set forth in this article must be interpreted and understood as to not unreasonably frustrate or impede the desire or inclination of those who may want to seek public office or support those seeking public office. To that end, employees noted in this article should not, except as otherwise provided herein, be denied the opportunities available to all other citizens with respect to the participation in political activities. The policy and purpose of this article therefore is to make certain those privileges and prohibitions with respect to political activities shall comport with the objective of protecting the integrity of county government, and to prescribe only such essential restrictions as will not impose barriers repugnant to conscientious public service.

Furthermore, at no time shall an employee, in support of a candidate seeking any political office, engage in activity that would bring his or her employment with Clayton County into disrepute. 
(Ord. No. 2003-168, § 3, 12-16-03)

If the civil service board finds, following an investigation by the human resources department, that probable cause exists to believe a violation has occurred, the civil service board shall set the matter down for a hearing at its next regularly scheduled hearing date and all interested parties (specifically to include the complainant and accused violator) shall be notified accordingly.

(8)  The aesthetic effect of existing and future use of the property as it relates to the surrounding area.

(13)  The consideration of the preservation of the integrity of residential neighborhoods shall be considered to carry great weight. 
(14)  In those instances in which property fronts on major thoroughfare and also adjoins an established residential neighborhood, the factor of preservation of the residential area shall be considered to carry great weight. 
After hearing evidence at the zoning hearing, the board of commissioners shall apply the evidence to the standards of review in making their decision. It will not be required that the board of commissioners consider every criteria contained in the standards of review. It shall be the duty of the applicant to carry the burden of proof that the proposed zoning map amendment promotes the public health, safety, morality or general welfare.

Otherwise such application shall be denied. 
(c)  In ruling on any petition in which the petitioner has brought a challenge of the existing zoning classification, the commissioners will follow these general lines of inquiry:

(6)  The length of time the property has been vacant as zoned, considered in the context of land development in the area in the vicinity of the property.

(d)  If the board of commissioners determines from the evidence presented that the existing zoning classification is unduly burdensome to the petitioner and is not offset by considerations of the public health, safety, morals and welfare and considerations of the integrity of this section and the official zoning map, the commissioners may impose upon such property an appropriate zoning classification, including provisions which might be consistent with these considerations and the considerations contained in subsection (a) of this section.

(a)  Approval of alterations to historic properties. After designation by ordinance of a historic property and adoption of corresponding design guidelines, no demolition or material change in the appearance of such historic property shall be made or be permitted to be made by the owner or occupant thereof unless or until application for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted to and approved by the historic preservation commission. 
(b)  Approval of new construction to historic properties.

Such structures, buildings, objects, or works of art shall conform in design, scale, building materials, setback, and landscaping to the character of historic property specified in the historic preservation commission's design guidelines. If, in the opinion of the historic preservation commission, any such structure, building, object or work of art would fail to comply with the guidelines and would be inconsistent with the character of the historic property, the certificate of appropriateness shall be denied. Reasons for denial shall be stated and transmitted to the applicant in writing. 
(c)  Submission of plans to historic preservation commission. An application for certificate of appropriateness shall be accompanied by such drawings, photographs, or plans as may be required by the historic preservation commission.

In making this determination, the historic preservation commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design arrangement, texture, and materials of the architectural feature involved, and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style, and pertinent features of the other structures, buildings, objects, or works of art in the immediate neighborhood in accordance with the adopted design guidelines.

(e)  Public hearing on applications for certificates of appropriateness, notices, and right to be heard. At least seven days prior to review of a certificate of appropriateness the historic preservation commission shall take such action as may reasonably be required to inform the owners of any property likely to be affected by reason of the application and shall give applicant and such owners an opportunity to be heard. Notice in Clayton County's legal organ or newspaper of general circulation within Clayton County shall, for the purpose of this section, be deemed to be sufficient action. 
In cases where the historic preservation commission deems it necessary, it may hold a public hearing concerning the application, noticed in Clayton County's legal organ or newspaper of general circulation within Clayton County at least one time not less than ten days nor more than 20 days prior to the hearing. 
At such hearing, any interested party shall be given the opportunity to comment on the request. 
(f)  Interior alterations. In its review of applications for certificates of appropriateness, the historic preservation commission shall not consider interior arrangement or use having no effect on exterior architectural features nor shall the commission consider the construction of or alterations to backyard fences. 
(g)  Technical advice. When dealing with difficult technical questions, the historic preservation commission shall have the power to seek expert advice within approved budgetary limitations. 
(h)  Deadline for approval or rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness. The historic preservation commission shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application for a certificate of appropriateness within no more than 45 days after the filing of a complete application by the owner or authorized agent of a historic property.

(i)  Necessary actions to be taken by historic preservation commission upon rejection of application for certificate of appropriateness: 
(1)  In the event the historic preservation commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so and shall transmit a record of such actions and reasons, in writing, to the applicant. The historic preservation commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he or she so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
(2)  In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure, building, object or work of art which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of the application for a certificate of appropriateness by the historic preservation commission shall be binding upon the building official or other administrative officer charged with issuing building permits and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. 
(j)  Undue hardship. Where, by reason of unusual circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this chapter would result in exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of a specific property, the historic preservation commission, in passing upon applications, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to such provisions, or to interpret the meaning of such provisions, so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided such variances, modifications, or interpretations shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of such provisions, so that the architectural or historical integrity, or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variances, the historic preservation commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgement, best fulfill the purpose of this chapter. 
(k)  Requirement of conformance with certificate of appropriateness. Work not in accordance with an issued certificate of appropriateness shall be halted by the building official before it is completed.

(o)  Appeals. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the historic preservation commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the board of commissioners; the appeal must be applied for within 30 days after notification is sent.

Appeals from decisions of the board of commissioners made pursuant to this chapter may be taken to the superior court of the county in the manner provided by law for appeals from conviction for municipal or county ordinance violations. 
(p)  Department of transportation and local governments.

(1)  The structure is of such interest or quality it would reasonably meet national, state, or local criteria for designation as a historic property. 
(2)  The structure, building, object or work of art is of such unusual or uncommon design, texture or materials that it could not be reproduced or be reproduced only with great difficulty and expense. 
(3)  Retention of the structure, building, object or work of art would aid substantially in preserving and protecting a structure, building, object, work of art, or district which meets subsections (1) or (2) herein above.

(Ord. of 5-22-2008, § 1.15) 
Sec. 86-66. - Nonliability of county. 
Nothing in this article shall be deemed to impose any liability upon the county or upon any of its officers or employees or to relieve the owner and occupant of any private property from the duty to keep trees and shrubs upon private property or under his control in a safe condition. 
(Ord. of 5-22-2008, § 1.16) 
Sec. 86-67. - Violation and penalties. 
Any person violating a provision of this article shall be guilty of violating a duly adopted ordinance of the county, and, upon conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction, may be punished either by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per day, or confinement in the county jail not to exceed six months, or both. The court shall have the power and authority to place any person found guilty of a violation of this article on probation and to suspend or modify any fine or sentence. The owner of any property wherein a violation exists, and any builder, contractor or agent, who may have assisted in the commission of any such violation, may be guilty of a separate offense. 
(a)  A violation of this article shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1,000.00 per day and/or a sentence of up to 30 calendar days incarceration per day per occurrence. Nothing herein shall prevent the county from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violations. Replacement shall also be required.

(Ord. of 5-22-2008, § 1.19) 
Sec. 86-70. - Tree list. 
Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and protection for conservation. These trees are referred to as specimen trees. 
The following criteria are used by the administrator to identify specimen trees. Both the size and condition criteria must be met for a tree to qualify, with the exception of trees designated as specimen trees for historic or cultural purposes. 
The following list contains overstory and understory trees which are found in the Piedmont region and are recommended for use in meeting the tree requirements of this article. In selecting plant materials the standard for an overstory tree is that it attains a mature height in excess of 40 feet. An understory tree is one that does not reach 30 feet in height at maturity. 
The majority of the planting should be large canopy trees. Understory trees and ornamentals should be used as accents or in places with limited space for larger crown development. Species diversity and use of native plantings are highly recommended and preferred. Constraints of urban sites may limit the use of diverse and less-suited native trees; however, use of varied and native species should be practiced whenever possible.

**Information for most of the trees was found on http://pubs.caes.uga.edu/caespubs/pubcd/B625.htm and http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/hort/consumer/factsheets/trees-new/common_name  sq_t.html 
Please note: There is no set caliper for each type of tree as they vary in size (per contacts at landscape supply stores and nurseries). Root ball estimate: for a 2- to 2 1/2 inch in diameter tree, the root ball might be approximately 30 inch in diameter. 
(Ord. of 5-22-2008, app. A; Ord. No. 2017-42, § 7, 5-30-17) 
Sec. 86-71. - Specimen trees. 
Some trees on a site warrant special consideration and protection for conservation. These trees are referred to as specimen trees. 
The following criteria are used by the administrator to identify specimen trees. Both the size and condition criteria must be met for a tree to qualify, with the exception of trees designated as specimen trees for historic or cultural purposes. 
Size criteria. 
• Large Hardwoods Trees: 24-inch DBH or larger—such as oaks, hickories, yellow poplars, sweetgums, etc. 
• Large Softwoods Trees: 30-inch DBH or larger—such as pines, deodar cedars, etc. 
• Understory Trees: Four inch DBH or larger—such as dogwoods, redbuds, sourwoods, etc. 
Condition criteria. 
• At least ten years life expectancy. 
• Trunk is relatively sound and solid with no extensive decay. 
• No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only). 
• No major insect or pathological problem. 
Note: A lesser-sized tree can be considered a specimen tree if it is a rare or unusual species, of exceptional or unique quality, or of historical significance. 
In order to encourage the conservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects, additional density credit will be given for specimen trees, which are successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose. Credit for any specimen tree thus saved would be two times the assigned unit value shown in section 86-73. The CRZ of specimen trees will be protected with hog-back/wire-back tree save fencing with metal support posts. 
If a specimen tree is requested to be removed, a plan or written documentation indicating the reason for the removal must be submitted to the administrator for approval. 
Specimen trees that cannot be saved must be replaced with trees having three times the unit value of the tree removed with a minimum four-inch tree caliper by species with potentials for comparable size and quality. 
Any specimen tree which is removed without the appropriate review and approval of the administrator must be replaced by trees with a total density equal to eight times the unit value of the tree removed with a minimum four-inch tree caliper or an equivalent payment to the tree bank fund. Size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is no evidence of its condition. Violations will be subject to the applicable penalties as described in section 86-67 of this article. 
(Ord. of 5-22-2008, app. B) 
Sec. 86-72. - Timber harvesting. 
Applications for tree cutting shall be in accordance with current timber harvesting plan review procedures. Approval of the timber harvesting permit shall be made by the zoning administrator based on the timber harvesting plan that shall be submitted by a registered forester, civil engineer, or landscape architect. Plans and other supportive documents submitted for a timber harvesting permit for tree cutting in areas greater than five acres shall bear the signature of a registered forester. 
Tree cutting, clearing, or clearing and grubbing projects, which result in the sale of timber, shall conform to state law regarding payment of taxes. A state department of revenue form PT-283T, along with the required payment, must be submitted to the county tax assessor's office within the time frame prescribed by state law. Failure to do so shall be considered a violation of the tax law. Call the county tax assessor's office for more information (P.K. Dixon Building, Annex 2, 121 South McDonough Street, Jonesboro, GA 30236. Phone 770-477-3285). 
Documentation regarding the type of timber sale, estimated date of purchase, and estimated PT-283T submittal date shall be provided when submitting plans to the department of community development for review. 
The minimum size of plans shall be 11 by 14 inches. The maximum size shall be 24 by 36 inches. 
Plans shall include the following information: 
• Owner's name, address and phone number. 
• Consultant's and contractor's names, addresses and phone numbers. 
• Location/vicinity map. 
• Land lot(s) and district(s). 
• Parcel ID number. 
• North arrow. 
• Scale (minimum 1" = 100'). 
• Closed property boundary showing bearings and distances of all property lines. 
• Current zoning of property. 
• Current zoning of adjacent properties. 
• Total acreage of property and approximate acreage of area to be disturbed. 
• 24-hour emergency contact name and phone number(s) in bold type (no smaller than 20 point type). 
• Names of adjoining roadways. 
• Location of and detail for the truck exit (co or crushed stone pad). 
• Approximate location of the following land features: 
• All state waters. 
• Topography at 20-foot intervals (U.S.G.S. Quadrangle map). 
• Forest cover areas. 
• 100-year floodplain. 
• Wetlands. 
• Limits of land disturbance activity. 
• Approximate locations and dimensions of any logging decks. 
• Location of any state water buffers (dimension 25 feet undisturbed zones from the top of each bank). 
• Location of the streamside management zone (dimension required width). 
• Approximate locations of any haul roads. 
• Approximate locations of any stream crossings showing approximate width of crossing (bank to bank) and method of sediment control (rock riprap or culvert). 
• Approximate locations of any historical features including cemeteries; or, a note indicating the absence of such on the site. 
• Delineation and labeling of any required buffer zones around the perimeter of the property. 
• A detail of the method to be used to delineate all buffers on the site. 
• Expected time frame in which the operation will occur. 
• Any additional information as may be required by Clayton County staff to perform a proper review of the project. 
The following notes: 
• Erosion control measures shall be utilized as determined to be necessary to insure the minimization of any potential impacts on surrounding properties by the department of transportation and development. The county transportation and development department reserves the right to require additional erosion and sedimentation control measures deemed necessary. 
• The contractor shall implement all best management practices for forestry as prescribed by the state forestry commission and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
• At the minimum a 25-feet wide undisturbed buffer shall be maintained along all property lines to reduce the impact or the harvesting on surrounding properties. Where a greater width buffer is required by the zoning ordinance, the more restrictive buffer shall be enforced. 
• No trees may be cut in buffer zones marked "undisturbed." Tree cutting shall be limited to the nonmechanical removal of pine, sweet gum, or yellow-poplar trees with stump diameters greater than 15 inches; provided, that a minimum of 50 square feet of basal area remains in good condition in the buffer area at completion of the project. The nonmechanical removal of dead, diseased or insect infested trees is also allowed in this buffer (subject to verification by the county arborist). 
• A minimum of ten trees per acre at six inch diameter breast height shall be saved in addition to any required buffers. (No clear cutting will be allowed) 
• All buffers of state waters shall remain undisturbed except for haul road crossing points. 
• Projects, which are restricted to a "residential thinning," must leave a minimum density of 30 square feet of basal area throughout all areas not designated as buffers or logging decks. Trees to be preserved to meet this requirement must be identifiable both before and after the harvest either by species or by a continuous marking around the trunk at four and one-half feet and at one-half feet above the ground. These trees must be left in good condition with no injuries to the trunk, crown or root system, which would predispose them to disease or pest infestation. 
• All pine logging slash with stems larger than five inches in diameter shall be chipped and returned to the site or removed from the site to reduce the possibility of insect infestation. 
• Logging decks, temporary haul roads, skid trails and any other disturbed areas left idle for two to four weeks will be restored to their contours and established to temporary vegetation (Ds2). These disturbed areas left idle for four weeks or more will be established to permanent vegetation (Ds3). All areas remaining at the end of the project will be established to permanent vegetation within two weeks. 
• When hand planting, mulch (hay or straw) should be uniformly spread over seeded area within 24 hours of seeding. 
• During unsuitable growing seasons, mulch will be used as a temporary cover (Ds1). On slopes that are 4:1 or steeper, mulch will be anchored. 
• The county timber harvesting permit must be displayed on site at all times during the project operation and in plain view from an adjacent county road or street. 
• Fees shall be assessed as delineated by the department of community development's fee schedule. 
Before any activity can begin an inspection must be performed for basal area confirmation, erosion control devices and buffer area delineation. At this time, the contractor must show a current county business license or registration certificate. At completion of the project, a final inspection must be performed. 
(Ord. of 5-22-2008, app. C) 
Sec. 86-73. - Tree protection and replacement standards. 
The objective of the tree protection and replacement standards is to delineate the required methods of providing tree protection and replacement as determined by this article. 
A basic requirement of this article is that all applicable sites maintain a minimum tree density of 20 units per acre. The term "unit" is an expression of basal area (a standard forest inventory measurement), and is not synonymous with "tree." 
This density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development. The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved, planting new trees, or some combination of the two as represented by the formula: 
SDF - EDF = RDF 
SDF (site density factor) = The minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed site (units per acre). 
EDF (existing density factor) = Density of existing trees to be preserved on a site. 
RDF (replacement density factor) = Density of new trees to be planted on a site. 
The SDF is calculated by multiplying the number of site acres by the desired density (minimum of 20 units per acre or greater). 
The EDF is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees to density factor units. Using table A below does this. 
The RDF is calculated by subtracting the EDF from the SDF. 
The density factor credit for each caliper size of replacement (new) trees is shown in table B. 
Example: A 2.2 acre site has a SDF of 2.2 × 20 = 44 
A total of 15 trees will remain on the 2.2-acre site. The tree inventory is as follows: 
7—12 inch diameter pines 
3—14 inch diameter pines 
3—18 inch diameter oaks 
1—21 inch diameter hickory 
1—30 inch diameter oak 
Converting diameters (DBH) to density units, the EDF is determined as follows: 

 
RDF = 44 - 21.6 = 22.4 
TABLE A 
Conversion of existing tree diameters (DBH) to density factor units 

 
Note: DBH is rounded to nearest inch (.5 and higher to next full inch, .4 and lower is truncated to lower inch). 
Note: Values for tree sizes 24 [inches] and greater are for trees that do not qualify as specimen trees and are not subject to specimen tree designation under section 86-71. Trees qualifying as specimen trees are subject to the benefits and restrictions note in the previously cited section. 
Note: Multi-trunked trees shall be given credit by measuring the single largest trunk only. Tree-form shrubs shall not be given credit. 
TABLE B 
Conversion of replacement tree caliper to density factor units 

 
Note: This column represents the number of trees that would need to be replanted if all one-size tree was used. This is provided for information purposes only, as it is likely that a variety of tree sizes would be used. 
Tree planting standards. 
Tree planting standards shall follow the requirements outlined in section 86-63 of this article. Additionally, the following guidelines shall be followed: 
(1)  No more than thirty (30) percent of all trees planted for replacement density credit may be of any one (1) species. 
(2)  Seven gallon pine trees to be planted to meet required replacement densities must be a least one inch in caliper and greater than or equal to four feet tall. 
(3)  Specimen tree replacement/recompense trees must be at least four inch caliper. 
(4)  No more than 20 percent of all trees planted for replacement density credit may be under two inch caliper. 
(5)  The spacing of replacement trees must be compatible with the spatial site limitations and with responsible consideration toward species size when mature. 
(6)  Trees selected for planting shall be a species listed in section 86-71. 
(7)  Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional disorders or root defects, and must be of good vigor, so as to assure a reasonable expectation of survivability. 
The planting of materials shall conform to the standardized landscape specifications as identified in the most recent edition of the American Nursery and Landscape Association ("ANLA"), The American Standard For Nursery Stock, (2004), which document is hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth in its entirety herein (said document may be obtained by contacting ANLA at 1000 Vermont Ave NW, Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 20005 (202/789-2900). All trees shall have tops which display a natural growing shape or condition. Trunks shall be healthy and free of defects or mutations such as, but not limited to, over guying. 
A secondary reference for tree planting and maintenance may be the best-practice recommendations of the International Society of Arboriculture (www.treesaregood.com). 
It is also noted (per the Georgia Model Urban Forest Book): 
(1)  Using a pneumatic excavating tool for excavation work that must happen inside the CRZ greatly reduces tree damage. This tool can remove soil around the tree's roots without harming them. 
(2)  Preconstruction preparation and post-construction follow-up are essential to tree success, especially for larger trees. The older the tree the longer the post-operation care period. 
(3)  When developing adjacent to or within existing forest, the shape and size of the resulting forest remnant is important to its success. Long narrow shapes with larger perimeters but small interior areas make it harder to develop successful tree preservation schemes but may be successful as buffers or wild life corridors. Rounder shapes make tree preservation easier. 
(4)  Trees transplant better when they are dormant and the environmental conditions are not going to be a stress factor. This would be October until bud break. The fall is considered optimal because the earth is still warm and roots can grow somewhat before cold winter temperatures.

That contract may be extended for an additional period if changes in the law occur during the contract running period. This authorization shall be cumulative of all other powers authorized and delegated to CCWA and other governmental subdivisions, cities, towns and counties by other laws of whatever kind and nature; and this enactment shall not limit or restrict such power or authority in any way. 
(c)  Private wastewater disposal. 
(1)  On-site sewage management systems shall be designed, constructed, repaired, altered, and maintained in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the health officer. On-site sewage management systems shall be maintained in sanitary working order. The maximum size of any on-site sewage management system shall not exceed an average daily flow capacity of 2,000 gallons. 
(2)  No person shall construct, repair, alter, or enlarge any septic tank unless he shall hold a valid permit for such work issued by the health officer. The health officer may withhold the issuance of such a permit pending an inspection and approval by the health officer of the site and location of the proposed work. Before any on-site sewage management system, or any part thereof may be covered after it has been constructed, repaired, altered, or enlarged, it shall be inspected and approved by the health officer. 
(3)  The type, capacities, location, and layout of on-site sewage management systems shall comply with all the requirements of the Georgia Department of Human Resources and Health Officer. No permit shall be issued for any on-site sewage management system employing subsurface soil absorption facilities where the area of the lot to be served thereby is less than 25,000 square feet. No septic on-site sewage management system shall be permitted to discharge to any natural outlet. 
(4)  No on-site sewage management systems shall be installed where a public sewer is reasonably accessible to the premises involved, nor in any place where the health officer deems the use of same to be a menace to human health or well being. 
(5)  At such time as access to a POTW becomes reasonably available to a property served by an on-site sewage management system, a direct connection shall be made, by owner of subject property upon which the on-site sewage management system is located, to the POTW within 30 days after notice. Any on-site sewage management system parts shall then be cleaned of sludge and filled with suitable material. 
(6)  It shall be unlawful to empty, dump, throw or otherwise discharge, into any manhole, catch basin or other opening, into the CCWA wastewater system, or any system connected with and discharging into the sewer system, the contents of any septic tank, sludge, sewage or other similar matter or material, except as provided in section 98-7(d)(1) of this article.

(Ord. No. 2002-51, § 1, 5-21-02; Ord. No. 2010-11, § 3, 5-18-10; Ord. No. 2018-17, § 1(Exh. A), 2-20-18) 
Sec. 98-3. - Sewer service charges. 
A charge is hereby levied on users of the Clayton County Water Authority's POTW for the total cost of operation and maintenance of such works, including replacement. The system of charges shall be established, maintained and annually reviewed and revised to assure that each recipient of wastewater treatment services pays its proportionate share of the total cost of operation and maintenance, including replacement. In setting said rates, factors such as strength, volume and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered by CCWA and included as the basis for the user's contribution to insure proportional distribution of total operation, maintenance and replacement cost to each user or class of user. CCWA shall review user charges annually, and revise them periodically to reflect actual treatment works total operations, maintenance and replacement cost. Sewer user service charges and rates shall be set for the purpose of generating sufficient revenue to offset the cost of all treatment works operations, maintenance and replacement costs. 
(1)  Service charge determination . Sewer user service charge shall be determined as follows: 
a.  The said sewer user service charge shall be based upon the quantity of water used by the said premises or facility therein or thereon as the same is measured by a water meter or meters therein used, or as otherwise currently established. 
b.  Said sewer user service charge shall be established by a formula consisting of the fraction of the "total operation, maintenance and replacement cost per unit time" over the "total volume contribution from all users per unit time" multiplied by the "volume contribution from the user per unit of time". 
c.  Said sewer user service charge shall consist of a charge per 1,000 gallons of water consumed, including adjustments thereto. 
d.  Water used from private sources shall be metered as required in section 98-3(2) and that portion of the sewer user service charge for the portion of sewerage shall be computed according to section 98-3(1). 
(2)  Other water sources . In the event a lot, parcel of land, premise or facility discharging wastewater, industrial waste, water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly into CCWA's wastewater system, or which ultimately enters the sewer system, is supplied either whole or in part, with water from wells, or any source other than CCWA, then such wells other source of supply shall be registered with CCWA, and if the water from said well or other supply is not measured by a water meter, the owner or occupant shall, at his own cost, install and maintain a meter on said supplies in such a location and in such a manner as is satisfactory to CCWA. These meters shall serve as a control for the establishment of the sewer service charge and shall be read monthly or bimonthly by agents of CCWA. 
(3)  Wastewater not discharged to POTW . Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the manager that a significant portion of the water as measured by the water meter or meters does not enter the wastewater system, then the manager may require or permit the installation of additional meters or other devices as may be deemed necessary to establish that portion that does not enter the wastewater system, and the correct meter flow will be used for billing of the sewer user service charge. All such additional facilities will be provided by the owner of the premises concerned or other interested parties at no expense to CCWA. 
(4)  Termination of service. If the payment of the sewer user service charge and/or the industrial waste surcharge is allowed to go into default by the customer, CCWA may take appropriate action to terminate the customer's water and sewer service, until such time as all sums due for sewer service, including penalties, are paid in full. 
(Ord. No. 2002-51, § 1, 5-21-02; Ord. No. 2018-17, § 1(Exh. A), 2-20-18) 
Sec. 98-4. - Industrial waste surcharge. 
All persons discharging industrial waste into the public sewers shall be charged and assessed a surcharge, in addition to any sewer service charges, if these wastes have a concentration greater than the following base-level concentrations: 
A five-day, 20° C biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 225 mg/l; 
A Total Suspended Solids (TSS) of 225 mg/l; 
A Total Kjehldahl Nitrogen (TKN) of 40 mg/l; 
A total Phosphorus of 6 mg/l; or 
Any other pollutants in excess of the "normal" level of such pollutants. 
The amount of such surcharge shall reflect the cost incurred by CCWA in handling the excess pollutants. This surcharge shall include a proportionate share of the following: fixed charges for maintenance, operation and replacement of the sewerage system to include sewers, plants, pumping stations and other necessary systems including depreciation and other incidental expenses. 
(1)  Surcharge determination. When the concentration of BOD, TSS, TKN, or Phosphorus of the water or waste accepted for admission to CCWA's wastewater system exceeds the base-level concentration for such element, the excess concentration shall be subject to a surcharge on the amount derived in accordance with the following formula: 
Amount of surcharge = [B1 (B) + S1 (S) + N1 (N) + P1 (P) + X1 (X)] V 
B1 = total operation, maintenance and replacement cost for treatment of a unit of BOD. 
B = concentration of BOD from the user above the base-level concentration for such element. 
S1 = total operation, maintenance and replacement cost for treatment of a unit of TSS. 
S = concentration of suspended solids from the user above the base-level concentration for such element. 
N1 = total operation, maintenance and replacement cost for treatment of a unit of TKN. 
N = concentration of TKN from the user above the base-level concentration for such element. 
P1 = total operation, maintenance and replacement cost for treatment of a unit of Phosphorus. 
P = concentration of Phosphorus from the user above the base level concentration for such element. 
X1 = total operation, maintenance and replacement cost for treatment of a unit of any pollutant. 
X = total contribution of any pollutant from the user above the base level concentration for such pollutant. 
V = volume contributed from the user per unit time. 
(2)  Annual review and billing. The rates of surcharges shall be reviewed annually by CCWA in order that the above factors may correctly represent current treatment cost, and may be modified at any time. Industrial waste surcharges provided for herein shall be prepared and rendered with the regular water and sewerage bill. 
(3)  Flow measurement. The volume of flow used to compute industrial waste surcharges shall be based upon metered, estimated or prorated water consumption as shown in the records of meter reading maintained by CCWA. In the event that a person discharging waste into the public wastewater system produces evidence to the manager that a significant portion of the total annual volume of water used for all purposes does not reach the public sewer system, an estimated percentage of total water consumption to be used in computing charges may be agreed upon between the manager and the persons discharging industrial waste into the sewer. Some installations will require wastewater flow measurement as agreed upon by the manager and the persons discharging the industrial waste into the sewer. At the manager's discretion, any permitted significant or categorical industrial user may be required to install a flow meter that measures instantaneous maximum flow rate in gallons per minute (GPM). 
(4)  Sampling frequency and methodology. The industrial waste of each person discharging the same into the public wastewater system shall be subject to periodic inspection and determination of characteristics and concentration of said waste shall be made semi-annually, or more often as may be deemed necessary by CCWA. Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative of the actual quality of the waste. All measurements, tests and analyses of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with sections 98-11(a) and (b). 
(5)  Disputes. In the event that an analysis of waste as determined by the sampling and gauging of waste from a person or industry by CCWA is disputed, a program of resampling and gauging, with subsequent chemical determinations may be instituted as follows: 
a.  The person or industrial user interested must submit a request for resampling and gauging of their waste to CCWA by letter and bind themselves to bear the expenses incurred by CCWA in the resampling and gauging and subsequent chemical determination of the waste. 
b.  The chemist or engineer employed by the company or person responsible for the request submitted to CCWA must confer with CCWA's representative in charge of gauging and sampling. They will establish the length of the rerun and the methods to be employed to determine the flow and to sample the flow. 
c.  The chemist or engineer engaged by the person or industry may be present during the gauging and sampling operation and also in the laboratory during the chemical determination of the analysis. 
d.  The results of the analysis, determined from the quantity and quality of the flow shall be considered as analysis of record and shall be used to establish current billing procedures. 
(Ord. No. 2002-51, § 1, 5-21-02; Ord. No. 2007-180, § 1, 11-20-07; Ord. No. 2018-17, § 1(Exh. A), 2-20-18) 
Sec. 98-5. - Building sewers and connections. 
The owner(s) of all houses, buildings, or properties used for human occupancy, employment, recreation, or other purposes situated within the CCWA jurisdiction and abutting on any street, alley, or right-of-way in which there is now located or may in the future be located a public sanitary sewer of CCWA is hereby required at the owner(s) expense to install suitable toilet facilities herein, and to connect such facilities directly with the proper public sewer in accordance with the provisions of this article, within 30 days after date of official notice to do so, provided that said public sewer is within 200 feet of the property line. 
All sinks, dishwashing machines, lavatories, basins, shower baths, bathtubs, laundry tubs, washing machines, and similar plumbing fixtures or appliances shall be connected to the public sewer; provided that where no sewer is available, septic tanks and other private subsurface disposal facilities approved by the health officer may be used. 
(1)  Connections. No unauthorized person(s) shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into, use, alter or disturb any public sewer without first obtaining a written permit from the manager. No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain that in turn is connected directly or indirectly to the public sanitary sewer unless such a connection is approved by CCWA. 
a.  A separate and independent building sewer and connection shall be provided for every building unless otherwise approved. A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for each residential unit of multi-unit residences unless otherwise approved. 
b.  All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and connection of building sewers shall be borne by the owners. The owners shall indemnify CCWA from any loss or damage that may be directly or indirectly occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. 
c.  All building sewers and connections shall be the responsibility and property of the landowner; and CCWA shall have no ownership in the same and no responsibility for maintenance of the same. 
d.  All such connections shall be made gas-tight and watertight. 
(2)  Building sewer permits. There shall be two classes of building sewer permits: one for residential and commercial service, and the other for service to establishments producing industrial wastes. In either case, the owners or his agent shall make application on a special form furnished by the CCWA. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the manager. A permit fee of an amount currently set by CCWA at the time the application is filed for residential and commercial service, or as currently set for an industrial building sewer connection, shall be paid to CCWA at the time the application is filed. The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Building Inspector of Clayton County when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection and testing shall be made under the supervision of the building inspector or his representative. Water and sewer service shall not be instituted until all fees levied by CCWA are paid and the county building inspector approves the connection. 
(3)  Applicable codes. The size, materials of construction, methods of construction, slope, and alignment of all water and wastewater facilities construction shall conform to the technical codes and specifications described below.

Sec. 98-6. - General sewer use requirements. 
It shall be unlawful to discharge to any natural outlet within Clayton County, or the area under the jurisdiction of CCWA, any wastewater or other polluted waters, including septic tank effluent or cesspool overflow to any open drain or well-penetrating, water bearing formation, except where suitable treatment has been provided in the accordance with this article. 
(a)  Prohibited discharge standards. 
(1)  General prohibitions . No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. 
(2)  Specific prohibitions . No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater: 
a.  Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140º F (60ºC) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21; 
b.  Wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or more than 12.5, or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment; 
c.  Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference, but in no case solids greater than one-half inch (0.5") in any dimension; 
d.  Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with the POTW; 
e.  Wastewater having a temperature greater than 150º F (65º C), or which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the introduction into the treatment plant to exceed 104º F (40º C); 
f.  Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through;

p.  Total Residual Chlorine in concentrations of greater than four mg/l, unless agreed upon by the manager to allow a higher limit based on demand in sewer collection system. 
(4)  If any water or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which contain the substances identified in section 98-6(a) (1), (2) or (3), and which may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater treatment facilities, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the manager may: 
a.  Reject the wastes, 
b.  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the POTW; 
c.  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge, and/or 
d.  Require surcharge payment to cover additional cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges. 
If the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows is allowed, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval by CCWA. An owner or operator of any source to which the pretreatment standards are applicable shall comply with 40 CFR Part 403, as the same may be, from time to time, amended or replaced. 
(5)  Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW. 
(b)  National categorical pretreatment standards. The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated. 
(1)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, CCWA may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
(2.  When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, CCWA shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
(3)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(4)  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
(5)  Where CCWA's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, CCWA may apply to the approval authority for modification of these specific limits. "Consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of a pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in 95 percent of the samples taken when measured according to procedures set forth in 40 CFR Part 403, Sec. 403.7(c)(2). CCWA may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR Part 403, Sec. 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the Georgia Environmental Protection Division is obtained. 
(c)  State pretreatment standards. State pretreatment standards located at Chapter 391-3-6-.08 of Georgia Rules and Regulations for Water Quality Control are hereby incorporated. 
(d)  Local limits. The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following instantaneous maximum allowable discharge limits (mg/l): 
(1)  Arsenic 0.208 
(2)  Cadmium 0.029

(f)  Food service facility grease management program . 
(1)  The purpose of this program is to minimize the introduction of fats, oils, and greases into the Clayton County Water Authority (CCWA) wastewater collection system. The main components of the program are the proper sizing, installation, and maintenance of grease interceptors. The administrative and inspection requirements of food service facilities are established herein as well. 
(2)  General criteria: 
a.  Installation requirements for new food service facilities . All proposed or remodeled food service facilities inside the CCWA Wastewater Service area shall be required to install an approved, properly operated and maintained grease interceptor. All interceptor units shall be installed outdoors of the food service facility building unless the user can demonstrate to CCWA that an outdoor interceptor would not be feasible. All interceptor units shall be of the type and capacity approved by the county and CCWA. 
b.  Prohibited discharges . Domestic wastewater shall not be discharged to the grease interceptor unless specifically approved, in writing, by CCWA. 
c.  Requirements for existing food service facilities . All existing food service facilities inside the CCWA wastewater service area are expected to conduct their operations in such a manner that grease is captured on the user's premises and then properly disposed. Existing food service facilities will be handled under CCWA's grease management program in the following manner: 
1.  CCWA will periodically inspect each food service facility on an as-needed basis to assure that each facility is complying with the intent of the grease management program. The as needed inspection shall be determined by the CCWA. 
2.  Each food service facility in the vicinity of the problem area will be inspected. The facilities' grease control practices and the adequacy of their grease control interceptor/equipment will be assessed. Maintenance records will also be reviewed. 
3.  Following the inspections, CCWA will send written notice to the inspected food service facilities, containing a summary of the policy requirements, and the results of the inspection. The inspections will typically result in one or more of the following actions: 
(i)  Facilities equipped with an appropriate and adequately sized grease interceptor who are meeting the intent of the grease management program through effective grease control practices will be commended for their compliance. 
(ii)  After notice and an opportunity to be heard, facilities not in compliance shall be issued a letter of violation and, if such facility fails to achieve compliance, it shall be required to develop and submit to CCWA a proposed plan designed to achieve compliance through improved housekeeping and/or increased maintenance and pumping on the existing grease interceptor/equipment. 
(iii)  Facilities that are not successful in achieving compliance with the intent of the grease management program through improved housekeeping and increased maintenance and pumping on the existing grease interceptor/equipment will be required to install the necessary interceptor/equipment to bring the facility into compliance. 
4.  Alteration of an existing grease trap is prohibited by CCWA. If alteration is found, then an approved, properly sized grease interceptor will be required to bring the facility into compliance according to the grease management program. 
d.  Waste minimization plan . Food service facilities shall develop and implement a waste minimization plan pertaining to the disposal of grease, oils, and food particles. Educational materials are available from CCWA environmental compliance regarding the minimization of these wastes. 
e.  Floor drains . Only floor drains which discharge or have the potential to discharge grease shall be connected to a grease interceptor. 
f.  Location . Each grease interceptor shall be installed and connected so that it is easily accessible for inspection, cleaning, and removal of the intercepted grease at anytime. Grease interceptors required under this article shall be installed outdoors of the food service facility. The best location is in an area outside of an exterior wall, but upstream from the domestic wastewater drain line(s). A grease interceptor may not be installed inside any part of a building unless approved in writing by CCWA. The user bears the burden of demonstrating that an outdoor grease interceptor is not feasible. 
(3)  Design criteria: 
a.  Construction of interceptors . Grease interceptors shall be constructed in accordance with the county plumbing standards and outdoor units shall have a minimum of two compartments with fittings designed for grease retention. All alternative grease removal devices or technologies shall be subject to the written approval of CCWA. Such approval shall be based on demonstrated removal efficiencies of the proposed technology. 
b.  Access . Outdoor grease interceptors shall be provided with two manholes terminating 1-inch above finished grade with cast iron frame and cover. All grease interceptors shall be designed and installed to allow for complete access for inspection and maintenance of inner chamber(s) as well as viewing and sampling of wastewater discharged to the sanitary sewer. 
c.  Load-bearing capacity . In areas where additional weight loads may exist, the grease interceptor shall be designed to have adequate load-bearing capacity (example: vehicular traffic in parking or driving areas). 
d.  Inlet and outlet piping . Wastewater discharging to the grease interceptor shall enter only through the inlet pipe of the interceptor. The inlet pipe bottom tee branch shall extend one foot below liquid level. The outlet pipe bottom tee branch shall be submerged to two-thirds of the liquid depth. Each grease interceptor shall have only one inlet and one outlet pipe. 
e.  Interceptor sizing . 
1.  Outdoor grease interceptors shall not have a capacity of less than 1,500 gallons nor exceed a capacity of 3,000 gallons. No matter what the calculated capacity using the following formulas, the minimum interceptor size shall be 1,500 gallons. If the calculated capacity using one of the following formulas exceeds 3,000 gallons, then multiple units in series shall be installed. The size of a grease interceptor shall be approximated by the following methods and grease interceptor size shall be the larger of the two results. 
(i)  Interceptor Capacity (gallons) = (S) x (25) x (Hr/12) 
S = Number of Seats 
Hr = Maximum hours of daily operation (Include preparation and clean up time) 
(ii)  Interceptor Capacity (gallons) = (Sum of fixture flows) x (20) 

 
2.  All under counter or in-line grease interceptors shall not have a capacity of less than 100 lbs. Under-sink or in-line grease interceptor requirements shall meet Plumbing and Drainage Institute Standard PDI-G101: 

 
Grease interceptor designs represent minimum standards for normal usage. Installations with heavier usage require more stringent measures for which the user is responsible and shall pay the costs to provide additional measures if required by CCWA. CCWA reserves the right to evaluate interceptor sizing on an individual basis for facilities with special conditions, such as highly variable flows, high levels of grease discharge, or other unusual situations that are not adequately addressed by the formula. 
(4)  Grease interceptor maintenance: 
a.  Pumping . All grease interceptors shall be maintained by the user at the user's expense. Maintenance shall include the complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, and bottom sludges and solids. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the interceptor from which the waste was removed or any other grease interceptor, for the purpose of reducing the volume to be disposed, is strictly prohibited. 
b.  Pumping frequency . Outdoor grease interceptors must be pumped out completely a minimum of once every three months. Under-sink or in-line grease interceptors must be pumped/cleaned out completely a minimum of once every month. Grease interceptors may need to be pumped more frequently as needed to prevent carry over of grease into the sanitary sewer collection system. Pumping frequency may be extended past the minimum period if it can be demonstrated by the user and approved by CCWA. 
c.  Pump out order. When the oil and grease concentrations exceed CCWA's maximum discharge limits and/or the combined depth of bottom and top solids exceeds 25 percent of the total depth of the trap, CCWA will issue a pump out order to the user. The user shall have seven days from receipt of the order to comply. Where an emergency exists, a written or verbal warning shall be given to the user, and the user will have 24 hours to comply. 
d.  Disposal of interceptor pumped material . All waste removed from each grease interceptor shall be recorded on a proper manifest form. Also, all waste removed from each grease interceptor must be disposed at a facility approved by CCWA to receive such waste in accordance with the provisions of this program. In no way shall the pumped material be returned to any private or public portion of the sanitary sewer collection system. Responsibility for waste removed from or found in a grease interceptor or waste improperly disposed of shall be placed upon the private company generator food service facility owner. 
e.  Additives . Any additive(s) placed into the grease interceptor or building discharge line system on a constant, regular, or scheduled basis shall be reported to CCWA. Such additives shall include, but are not be limited to commercially available bacteria or other additives designed to absorb, consume, or treat fats, oils, and grease. The use of additives shall in no way be considered as an alternative technology or a substitution for maintenance procedures required herein. 
f.  Chemical treatment . Chemical treatments such as drain cleaners, enzymes, acids, and other chemicals designed to dissolve, purge, or remove grease shall not be allowed to enter the grease interceptor. 
(5)  Administrative requirements: 
a.  Initial data acquisition . All food service facilities will be asked to complete a data sheet to establish the grease interceptor database. The CCWA database will be updated with additional or modified information after each yearly inspection. 
b.  Administrative fees . No fee will be charged for an annual inspection by CCWA. However, if the user's grease interceptor is not in compliance with this section, up to a $200.00 re-inspection fee may be charged for each inspection thereafter until compliance is achieved. 
c.  Inspection and entry . Authorized personnel of CCWA, bearing proper credentials and identification, shall have the right to enter upon all properties subject to this program, at any time and without prior notification, for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling, testing or record review, as part of this program. 
d.  Record retention and reporting . All users must keep a record of any cleaning or maintenance of their grease interceptor. The following records must be kept on-site at the food service facility for a period of three years. Manifests are required for all grease interceptors and shall contain the following information: 
1.  Food service facility (generator) information, including name, address, volume pumped, date and time of pumping, and generator signature verifying the information. 
2.  Transporter information, including company name, address, license plate number, permit number, driver name, and driver signature verifying transporter information.

This description should include a schematic process diagram that indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
d.  Flow measurement . Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined wastestream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
e.  Measurement of pollutants. 
1.  The categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
2.  The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the manager, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in section 98-11(a) of this article. 
3.  Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in section 98-11(b) of this article. 
f.  Certification . A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
g.  Compliance schedule . If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in section 98-10(b) of this article. 
h.  Signature and certification . All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 98-8(f) of this article. 
(b)  Compliance schedule progress reports . The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by section 98-10(a)(2)g. of this article: 
(1)  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 
(2)  No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months; 
(3)  The user shall submit a progress report to the manager no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
(4)  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the manager. 
(c)  Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the manager a report containing the information described in section 98-10(a)(2)d.—f. of this article. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 98-8(f) of this article. 
(d)  Periodic compliance reports . 
(1)  All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency of no more than 12 times but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 98-8(f) of this article. 
(2)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(3)  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required, using the procedures prescribed in section 98-11(b) of this article, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(e)  Reports of changed conditions . Each user must notify CCWA of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system that might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days before the change. 
(1)  CCWA may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 98-8(e) of this article. 
(2)  CCWA may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 98-8(g) of this article or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 98-9(d) of this article in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
(3)  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of 20 percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
(f)  Reports of potential problems. 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the manager of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(2)  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the manager, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
(3)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in paragraph (1), above. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(g)  Reports from unpermitted users . All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to CCWA as CCWA may require. 
(h)  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting . If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the manager within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if CCWA monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if CCWA samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
(i)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(1)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under setion 98-10(e) of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 98-10(a),(c), and (d) of this article. 
(2)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (1), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the manager, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
(j)  Timing . Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports that are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(k)  Confidential information . Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the manager's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the manager, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 
(l)  Electronic reporting . The manager may allow reports, including monitoring information, to be submitted on electronic media or electronically using the Internet. In such cases, the user shall acquire the necessary software as approved by the manager, at their own expense. The manager may require an original report, signed and certified, using conventional methods in addition to the electronic format. 
(Ord. No. 2002-51, § 1, 5-21-02; Ord. No. 2018-17, § 1(Exh. A), 2-20-18) 
Sec. 98-11. - Compliance monitoring. 
(a)  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. 
(b)  Sample collection. 
(1)  Except as indicated in section (2), below, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, CCWA may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(3)  All sampling and analysis done for compliance purposes must be accompanied by proper chain-of-custody documentation. 
(c)  Right of entry: inspection and sampling . CCWA shall have the right to enter the premises of any user as permitted by law to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this article and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the manager ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(1)  Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the manager will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
(2)  The manager shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
(3)  The manager may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at least biannually to ensure their accuracy. 
(4)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the manager and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the user. 
(5)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the manager access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article. 
(d)  Search warrants. If the manager has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of CCWA designed to verify compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the manager may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Magistrate Court of Clayton County, Georgia. 
(e)  Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or CCWA, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period.

Sec. 98-12. - Publication of users in significant noncompliance. 
CCWA shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean: 
(1)  Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken during a six month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount; 
(2)  Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33 percent or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH); 
(3)  Any other discharge violation that has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public; 
(4)  Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in CCWA's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge; 
(5)  Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance; 
(6)  Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules; 
(7)  Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or 
(8)  Any other violation(s) that will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 
(Ord. No. 2002-51, § 1, 5-21-02; Ord. No. 2018-17, § 1(Exh. A), 2-20-18) 
Sec. 98-13. - Enforcement remedies. 
(a)  Administrative enforcement remedies . 
(1)  Notification of violation . When a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the manager may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within five days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the manager to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
(2)  Increased self-monitoring. CCWA may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to increase the self- monitoring frequency for any or all parameters. The user will be responsible for all sampling, analyses, and reporting under an increased self-monitoring order. 
(3)  Consent orders . CCWA may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 98-13(a)(5) and (6) of this article and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(4)  Show cause hearing . CCWA may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the manager and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 20 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(5)  Compliance orders . When a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, CCWA may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(6)  Cease and desist orders . When a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or when the user's past violations are likely to recur, CCWA may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
a.  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
b.  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(7)  Administrative fines. 
a.  When CCWA finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, CCWA may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
b.  Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 20 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at the rate allowed by law, not to exceed a rate of 18 percent per annum. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 
c.  Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for CCWA to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, CCWA may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. CCWA may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 
d.  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(8)  Emergency suspensions . CCWA may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. CCWA may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
a.  Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, CCWA may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. CCWA may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in setcion 98-13(a)(9) of this article are initiated against the user. 
b.  A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under sections 98-13(a)(4) or (9) of this article. 
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. 
(9)  Termination of discharge . In addition to the provisions in section 98-9(f) of this article, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
a.  Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 
b.  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
c.  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
d.  Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
e.  Violation of the pretreatment standards in section 98-6 of this article. 
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 98-13(a)(4) of this article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by CCWA shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(10)  Water supply severance . Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 
(b)  Judicial enforcement remedies . 
(1)  Injunctive relief . When a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the manager may petition the Superior Court of Clayton County through CCWA's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The manager may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(2)  Civil penalties . 
a.  A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to CCWA for a maximum civil penalty of $10,000.00 per violation, per day and a minimum of $1,000.00. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. 
b.  The manager may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by CCWA. 
c.  In addition to the above-described penalties and damages, the law of the State of Georgia, O.C.G.A. § 41-2-5 can be used to abate any public nuisance resulting from a violation this article. 
d.  In addition to the above-described penalties and damages, the law of the State of Georgia, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-52, grants the Department of Natural Resources the power to fine violators up to a maximum of $50,000.00 per day. 
e.  In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires. 
f.  Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. 
(3)  Criminal prosecution . 
a.  A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than sixty (60) days, or both. 
b.  In addition to the above-described criminal penalties, O.C.G.A. § 12-5-53 imposes misdemeanor penalties up to $25,000.00 per day and imprisonment up to one year, and for far more serious offenses, imposes felony penalties up to $250,000.00 and imprisonment up to 15 years. 
(4)  Remedies nonexclusive . The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. Any, all, or any combination of these actions may be taken against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with CCWA's enforcement response plan. However, CCWA may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, CCWA is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. 
(Ord. No. 2002-51, § 1, 5-21-02; Ord. No. 03-128, § 10, 9-16-03; Ord. No. 2018-17, § 1(Exh. A), 2-20-18) 
Sec. 98-14. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Upset. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (3), below, are met. 
(3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(5)  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(6)  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 
(b)  Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in section 98-6(a)(1) of this article or the specific prohibitions in sections 98-6(a)(2)c. through g. of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when CCWA was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permits, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(c)  Bypass. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section, 
a.  "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility. 
b.  "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities that causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources that can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this section. 
(3)  a.  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the manager, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
b.  A user shall submit oral notice to the manager of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The manager may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(4)  a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the manager may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless 
1.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
2.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
3.  The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. 
b.  The manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the manager determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (c)(4)a of this section. 
(Ord. No. 2002-51, § 1, 5-21-02; Ord. No. 2018-17, § 1(Exh. A), 2-20-18) 
Sec. 98-15. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Pretreatment charges and fees. CCWA may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating CCWA's pretreatment program that may include: 
(1)  Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the cost of processing such applications; 
(2)  Fees for monitoring, inspection, and surveillance procedures including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users; 
(3)  Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
(4)  Fees for filing appeals; and 
(5)  Other fees as CCWA may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this article and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties chargeable by CCWA. 
(b)  Hardship variances. Any person or user, upon written application to the manager, who shows, in the case of the activity being conducted or operated, that compliance with a section of this article should either be impossible or would constitute an undue hardship because of time limitations, may be granted a variance. The variance, granted by the manager, shall be for a reasonable time. The manager may grant a variance on the condition that the person receiving it submit plans for the installation of pretreatment facilities to the manager within six months from the date of issuance of the variance. A variance shall not be granted under the provisions of this section where the person applying therefore is causing a nuisance or other injury to the public. Any variance granted under the provisions of this section shall not relieve the person receiving the variance from any liability or penalties imposed by law for the commission or maintenance of a public nuisance. 
(c)  Severability. If any provision of this article is invalidated by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall not be effected and shall continue in full force and effect. 
(d)  Recovery of costs incurred. CCWA shall have the right to bill a User for recovery of costs incurred when said user is determined to be in violation of the regulations in this sewer use article.

Sec. 3.34. - MX—Mixed Use District. 
Sec. 1.0 District Intent 
National trends toward urbanization are bolstering many "town centers" and neighborhood commercial districts, creating new destinations across the Atlanta region. The success of these new places is driven by burgeoning traffic congestion in Atlanta and market demand being generated by Millennials. This age cohort is seeking reduced commuting times and environments that offer a wide range of services and activities. Mixed Use Districts have been devised that revisit traditional development patterns. These districts can deliver a variety of housing options in close proximity to employment, consumer services, entertainment, recreation, public art and gathering spaces all within a setting that emphasizes walking rather than vehicle trips. 
The Mixed Use District is intended to capitalize on this market demand by establishing standards more consistent with that market than commercial districts of the past that are more suburban in character. These standards allow the flexibility developers of mixed use projects desire. 
The District promotes tailoring of development scale to the context by introducing a site plan specific process in which the development standards of the District are woven into an approved site plan. In this manner, development scale may be referenced to a neighborhood context as well as to a development setting more regional in scale. 
A full range of urban housing, employment, retail and entertainment options is accommodated by the Mixed Use District. Development standards are geared toward traditional downtowns with buildings at the street, dwellings above store fronts and offices and broad sidewalks and streetscapes designed to encourage a lively street scene. 
The Millennial market is generating demand for active and passive recreation, alternate transportation modes and greater social interaction. The creation of destinations that offer such public amenities proximate to developer generated housing, employment and shopping is a central tenet of the Mixed Use District. 
Sec. 2.0 Applicability 
Any property assigned the MX — Mixed Use District shall be subject to the standards of this Article. The District applies to limited scale and region scale developments with the latter geared toward a more intense development model.

TF-01: This Telecommunication Facility Standards section applies to all districts. 
The intent of this Telecommunications Ordinance is to ensure that residents and businesses in Clayton County have reliable access to telecommunications networks and state of the art communications services while also ensuring that this objective is achieved in a fashion that preserves the intrinsic aesthetic character of the community and is accomplished according to Clayton County's zoning, planning, and design standards. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 gave local government's land use and zoning authority, with certain limitations, to determine the placement, construction, and modification of wireless telecommunications facilities. Clayton County recognizes that facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be an economic development asset to Clayton County and a significant benefit to its residents. The intent of this wireless communication facilities ordinance is to accomplish the above stated objectives and to ensure that the placement, construction or modification of wireless telecommunications facilities complies with all applicable federal laws, and is consistent with Clayton County's land use policies, and wireless telecommunications ordinance. 
A.  This Ordinance is enacted for the purpose of safeguarding the public health, safety, and welfare by establishing general guidelines for the location and placement of antennas and towers. The goals of the ordinance are to: 
1.  Ensure access to reliable wireless communications services throughout all areas of Clayton County; 
2.  Encourage the use of existing monopoles, towers, utility poles, and other structures for the co-location of telecommunications facilities; 
3.  Encourage the location of new monopoles and towers in non-residential areas; 
4.  Minimize the number of new monopoles and towers that would otherwise need to be constructed by providing incentives for the use of existing structures; 
5.  Encourage the location of monopoles and towers, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community will be minimal; 
6.  Minimize the potential adverse effects associated with the construction of monopoles and towers through the implementation of reasonable design, landscaping and construction practices; 
7.  Ensure public health, safety, welfare, and convenience; and 
8.  Conform to Federal and State laws that allow certain antennas to be exempt from local regulations. 
TF-02: General Requirements. 
A.  Principal or Accessory Use: Antennas and towers may be considered either principal or accessory uses.

(Ord. No. 2017-41, § 21, 5-30-17) 
Sec. 6.48. - Auto Brokers (AB). 
AB-01: Definition. 
An auto broker is an individual who markets passenger vehicles from an office with the actual vehicles being stored off-site. Customers typically conduct their vehicle search on-line and vehicles purchased are delivered directly from the storage lot to the buyer without the necessity of being brought to the office location. Auto brokers are license by the Georgia State Board of Registration of Used Motor Vehicle Dealers & Used Motor Vehicle Parts Dealers. 
AB-02: Purpose. 
Auto brokers are a use apart from car dealers since, as defined, display of vehicles by an auto broker on a lot within the County is prohibited. The use is therefore, relegated to that of an office use. Such office uses do not ordinarily contribute to a walkable commercial district that features attractive shops, eateries and service uses that contribute to formation of an inviting destination. Accordingly, auto brokers are deemed compatible with other uses permitted in an Office-Institutional District. Auto broker operations are characterized by on-line marketing of vehicles, without need of face-to-face contact. Such interaction is the antithesis of welcoming shopping districts in which purchases are made, and meetings are held, as in the case of a law office or a real estate office. Clayton County commercial districts should be reserved for retail, office and service uses where a good or service is delivered on-site to the customer. 
AB-03: Applicable Zoning Districts. 
Auto brokers may be established in the O-I, Office-Institutional District. 
AB-04: Development Standards. 
(a)  License required. Any auto broker, as herein defined and consistent with the term "motor vehicle broker" as such term is defined in O.C.G.A., section 43-47-2, doing business within Clayton County shall obtain a license from the County Clerk in the manner specified in this chapter. 
(b)  Procedure for issuance. The County Clerk shall forward all applications for an auto broker occupational tax permit to the Zoning Administrator within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt of an application. The Zoning Administrator shall review the application and, if approved, forward a written decision in the form of a Zoning Certification to the County Clerk within ten (10) business days of receipt of an application. The County Clerk shall then forward the Zoning Certification to the applicant. 
(c)  Restriction on issuance. Upon presentation of the Zoning Certification to the Georgia State Board of Registration of Used Motor Vehicle Dealers & Used Motor Vehicle Parts Dealers by the applicant and receipt of an auto broker's license issued to the applicant by the State Board, the applicant may apply for an occupational tax permit to conduct business as an auto broker. No occupational tax permit under this section shall be issued by Clayton County to any applicant who has not obtained a license from the Georgia State Board of Registration of Used Motor Vehicle Dealers & Used Motor Vehicle Parts Dealers. 
(d)  Records. Each licensed auto broker shall maintain a record of all motor vehicles offered for sale to the public which shall indicate the make and model of the motor vehicle, year of manufacture, serial number and engine number. Such record shall be made available to the Police Chief or any Police Officer within the County and open to his or her inspection at any time. 
(e)  Inspections. The County shall make inspections from time to time for the purpose of ensuring the records required in this section are being kept. 
(f)  Fee established. The annual occupational tax permit fee for each auto broker conducting business in the county shall be set from time to time and a schedule of such fee shall be on file in the County Clerk's office. 
(g)  Inventory stored off-site. No automobiles may be stored at the location of auto brokers office. 
(h)  Exceptions. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to apply to any individual making an isolated sale of his or her personal vehicle. 
(Ord. No. 2017-41, § 22, 5-30-17) 
Sec. 6.49 - Electric fences (EF).

1.  IEC Standard 60335-2-76: Unless otherwise specified herein, electric fences shall be constructed or installed in conformance with the specifications set forth in International Electro Technical Commission (IEC) Standard No. 60335-2-76. 
2.  Electrification: 
(a)  The energizer for electric fences must be driven by a commercial storage battery not to exceed 12 volts DC. The storage battery is charged primarily by a solar panel. However, the solar panel may be augmented by a commercial trickle charger. 
(b)  The electric charge produced by the fence upon contact shall not exceed energizer characteristics set forth in paragraph 22.108 and depicted in Figure 102 of IEC Standard No. 60335-2-76. 
3.  Perimeter fence or wall: 
(a)  No electric fence shall be installed or used unless it is completely surrounded by a non-electrical fence or wall that is not less than six feet. 
4.  Location: Electric fences shall be permitted in HI (heavy industrial) and LI (light industrial) districts only. 
5.  Height: Electric fences shall have a height of 10 feet (or 2 feet higher than the perimeter fence whichever is higher).

The use patterns of the areas involved shall provide a desirable environment and shall be harmonious with the general surrounding uses permitting flexibility in overall development while ensuring the highest of safeguards and standards for public health, safety, convenience and general welfare. The PUD district shall encourage the use of land in accordance with its character and adaptability; conserve natural and social/cultural resources and provide sustainable design and energy efficiency; encourage innovation in land use and community planning; and bring about a greater compatibility of design and use. 
Sec. 7.2 - District Intent, Permitted Uses and Miscellaneous Standards. 
The purpose of the PUD is to stimulate the development of balanced neighborhoods containing physical, economic, and social assets difficult to achieve through the traditional separation of uses and density limits. This is accomplished by allowing the applicant the freedom necessary to: protect natural resources; protect and improve social and economic development; and, to protect the investment of both the County and the development. 
In reviewing the PUD, the following guidelines should be observed: 
A.  The protection of both the aesthetics and function of the natural environment. 
B.  The arrangement of buildings and other improvements advantageous to the orderly function and aesthetics of both the natural and man made environment, 
C.  The preservation of adequate, permanent open space for the use of residents and workforce in the development and the County. 
D.  A variety of housing types and densities necessary to achieve and balanced neighborhood. 
E.  The provision land area necessary to accommodate all cultural, educational, recreational, and other activities necessary to serve the needs of the development and County. 
F.  The orderly and creative arrangement of all land uses with respect to each other and the County (including residential, commercial, industrial and public uses). 
G.  The provision of developed recreational activity areas necessary to serve the needs of any residential portion of the development. 
H.  The provision of a pedestrian environment separate from the vehicular environment. 
I.  The creation of neighborhoods compatible with the County's Comprehensive Land Use Plan. 
Sec. 7.2.1. Uses. 
All uses indicated as permitted, accessory, and conditional in all zoning districts except HI (Heavy Industrial) are uses subject to the approval of the Board of Commissioners in the same manner as conditional uses. Approved uses shall be so indicated by the Board's adoption of the approved site plan. 
Sec. 7.2.2. Site plan. 
The proposed PUD site plan must provide for a minimum of twenty percent (20%) open space. The site plan must also indicate each permitted use, including number of lots, size of lots and setbacks. Any non-residential use shall be integrated with the community, and not designed to cater exclusively to outside markets. The approved site plan shall constitute the zoning of the property. 
(Ord. No. 2017-41, § 23, 5-30-17) 
Sec. 7.3 - Origination of Proposals. 
Any applicant may propose a Planned Unit Development District in accordance with the procedures established in this Article. Further, the applicant making such a proposal must intend to act as developer or sponsor of the development. A parcel or site proposed for Planned Unit Development need not be under single ownership, but the applicant shall provide sufficient documentation of ownership or control in the form of agreements, contracts, covenants, and/or deed restrictions that indicate that the development will be completed in its entirety as proposed. 
Sec. 7.4 - Eligibility. 
To be eligible for Planned Unit Development consideration, the applicant must present a proposal for residential development that meets each of the following: 
A.  Recognizable benefits. A Planned Unit Development shall result in a recognizable and substantial benefit, both to the residents of the property and to the overall quality of life in the County. The benefits can be provided through site design elements in excess of the requirements of this ordinance, such as high quality architectural design, extensive landscaping, transition areas between adjacent land uses, unique site design features, unified access, provision of social space, preservation of woodlands and open space, particularly along major thoroughfares, and buffering development from lakes, rivers, streams and wetlands. This benefit should accrue, in spite of any foreseeable detriments of the proposed development. 
B.  Uses proposed. The uses proposed will have a beneficial effect, in terms of public health, safety, welfare or convenience or any combination thereof, on present and potential surrounding land uses. The uses proposed will encourage a more efficient use of public utilities and services and lessen the burden on circulation systems, surrounding properties, and the environment. This beneficial effect for the County (not the developer) shall be one which could not be achieved under any other single zoning classification. The zoning is warranted by the design and amenities incorporated in the development proposal. 
C.  Qualification requirements. The proposed development shall provide at all of the following: 
1.  Preservation of significant natural assets. The site contains significant natural assets such as woodlands, rolling topography with grades exceeding fifteen (15) percent, significant views, natural drainage ways, water bodies, floodplains, regulated or non-regulated wetlands, or natural corridors that connect quality wildlife habitats which would be in the best interest of the County to preserve and which might be negatively impacted by conventional residential development. 
2.  Recreation facilities. If the site lacks natural features, it can qualify if the development will preserve existing or provide new recreation facilities and open spaces to which all residents of the development shall have reasonable access. Such facilities include areas such as a neighborhood park, plazas, golf course, passive recreational facilities, soccer fields, ball fields, bike paths or similar facilities which provide a feature of community-wide significance and enhance residential development. 
3.  Mixed use & Infill development/redevelopment. The development will provide a complimentary and integrated mixture of uses, residential densities and housing types. A project which proposes a combination of single-family detached and multiple-family housing or a mixture of compatible residential and commercial uses may be considered a Mixed Use Project. Such mixture of uses shall be integrated into a cohesive, pedestrian scale neighborhood. Land located within the older urbanized area of the County qualify for development as mixed use. 
4.  Infill development/redevelopment. Land located within the older urbanized area of the County qualify for development as mixed use. 
D.  Guarantee of open space. Usable open space shall be provided, as required herein. The applicant shall guarantee to the satisfaction of the County that all open space portions of the development will be maintained in the manner approved. 
E.  Cohesive neighborhood. The proposed development shall be designed to create cohesive community neighborhoods through a network of spaces such as parks, plazas and common open space areas for passive or active recreation and resident interaction. All open space areas shall be equally available to all residents of the development. 
F.  Unified control. The proposed development shall be under single ownership or control, such that there is a single person or entity having proprietary responsibility for the full completion of the project. The applicant shall provide sufficient documentation of ownership or control in the form of agreements, contracts, covenants, and/or deed restrictions that indicate that the development will be completed in its entirety as proposed. 
G.  Density impact. The proposed type and density of use shall not result in an unreasonable increase in the need for or impact on public services, facilities, roads, and utilities in relation to the use or uses otherwise permitted by this ordinance, and shall not place an unreasonable impact to the subject and/or surrounding land and/or property owners and occupants and/or the natural environment. 
H.  Parking. Off-street parking sufficient to meet the minimum required by Section 6.32, Parking Standards, shall be provided. Deviations from the Parking Standards are possible, and require justification via a valid traffic study. 
I.  Landscaping. Landscaping shall be provided so as to ensure that proposed uses which may impede upon neighboring uses will be adequately buffered from one another and from surrounding public and private property. Landscaping and buffering sufficient to meet the minimum required by Section 6.34, Landscaping Standards, and Section 6.35, Buffer Yard Standards, shall be provided. Deviations from the Landscaping Standards and Buffer Yard standards will be considered, provided that a landscape plan prepared and stamped by a certified landscape architect is prepared and submitted. Said landscape plan will bear the burden to prove how the proposal is more beneficial than the Landscaping Standards and Buffer Yard standards. 
J.  Circulation. Vehicular and non-motorized (pedestrian) circulation, allowing safe, convenient, uncongested and well-defined/understandable circulation within and to the district, shall be provided. 
K.  Comprehensive plan. The proposed development shall be consistent with and further the implementation of the Adopted Clayton County Comprehensive Plan and Future Land Use Map for the County.

A.  Basic regulations. All regulations applicable to setbacks, parking and loading, general provisions, and other requirements shall be met in relation to each respective land use in the development based upon zoning districts in which the use is listed as a permitted, accessory, or conditional use. The height, bulk, and area conditions set forth in Article 3, Zoning District Intent, Uses and Standards, shall be used as guidelines for the use areas set forth in the PUD plan. 
B.  Regulatory flexibility. To encourage flexibility and creativity consistent with the intent of the PUD regulations, the County Board of Commissioners may permit specific departures from the requirements of the zoning ordinance for yards and lots as a part of the approval process. Any regulatory modification shall be approved through a finding by the County that the deviation shall result in a higher quality of development than would be possible using conventional zoning standards. 
1.  A table shall be provided on the site plan which specifically details all deviations from the established zoning area, height and setback regulations, off-street parking regulations, general provisions, or subdivision regulations which would otherwise be applicable to the uses and development proposed in the absence of this PUD article. This specification should include ordinance provisions from which deviation are sought, and the reasons and mechanisms to be utilized for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare in lieu of the regulations from which deviations are sought. Only those deviations consistent with the intent of this ordinance shall be considered.

The common open space may either be centrally located along the road frontage of the development, located to preserve significant natural features, or located to connect open spaces, such as parks, common greens, plazas or buffers, throughout the development. 
F.  Pedestrian Connections. All open space areas and public spaces shall be linked with each other and with existing and future open spaces in adjacent development through the required sidewalk system or use of pedestrian pathways as identified within Section 6.14, Public Sites and Open Space Standards of the Subdivision Ordinance [Section 86-159. of this Code]. 
G.  Protection of open space. The dedicated open space shall be set aside by the developer through an irrevocable conveyance that is found acceptable to the County, such as: recorded deed restrictions, covenants that run perpetually with the land or conservation easements. Such conveyance shall assure that the open space will be protected from all forms of development, except as shown on an approved site plan, and shall never be changed to another use. The dedicated open space shall forever remain open space, subject only to uses approved by the County on the approved site plan. Further subdivision of open space land or its use for other than recreation or conservation purposes, except for easements for utilities and septic systems, shall be strictly prohibited. 
H.  Allowable structures. Any structure(s) or building(s) accessory to a recreation use may be erected within the dedicated open space, subject to the approved open space plan.

03: Sign Application Processing and Decision 
A.  Incomplete Application; False information. The Zoning Administrator shall reject any application that is incomplete or inaccurate, that contains false material statements or omissions, or that is for a sign which would violate any standard within this article within twenty (20) calendar days of receipt of said application. The Zoning Administrator may reject at any time prior to the expiration of the twenty (20) calendar day period, if the application is incomplete, inaccurate or contains false material statements or omissions, by returning the application to the applicant. 
B.  Processing Time: The County shall process all accurate and complete applications within thirty (30) calendar days, notifying the applicant of its decision. If the application meets the standards of the ordinance then it shall be approved and a permit issued. If the application does not meet the standards of the ordinance then the application shall be denied, if denied, the applicant may reapply correcting deficiencies in the original application. If a complete application is not ruled on within 30 days, it shall be deemed granted on the 31 st day after the later of the filing date or the date on which the application is complete.

Sec. 8.2.1. Variances. 
This section shall provide the exclusive procedures for granting variances to the requirements of this article. 
Upon application for a multiple occupancy non-residential lot covering more than ten (10) contiguous acres, the Board of Zoning Appeals may grant a variance to allow an increase in: 
A.  The maximum sign area for a monument signs an additional ten percent (10%); or 
B.  The maximum sign height for a monument sign an additional ten percent (10%); 
Provided the applicant shows all signs and structures within the business development are in conformance with this article. 
C.  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider the following factors: 
1.  The size and location of buildings constructed on the subject lot; 
2.  The number of different tenants occupying the buildings; 
3.  The topography of the subject property on which the sign is located or to be located renders it impossible to comply with the strict standards of this Article. 
4.  The natural features of the subject property on which the sign is located or to be located, or of the land immediately adjacent to the subject property, impairs the visibility of the sign such that it cannot be seen.

(Ord. No. 2012-232, § 1, 11-13-12; Ord. No. 2017-41, § 25, 5-30-17) 
Sec. 8.3 - Limitation Standards. 
A.  The following location and setback standards shall apply: 
1.  All signs and sign structures, except as noted below must be setback at least ten (10) feet from the public right-of-way. No portion of a sign or sign structure erected on private property shall encroach on or overhang the public right-of-way without proper approval from the Clayton County Department of Transportation and Development, or be located upon any other person's property. 
2.  Entrance signs must comply with any applicable provision in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, latest edition. 
3.  Setbacks are measured from the closest portion of the sign (whether that is the base, sign face, or the sign structure) to the right-of-way. 
4.  No non-government sign shall be located in the right-of-way. 
B.  Height Limits. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign structure at natural grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Natural grade shall be construed to be the lower of: (1) existing grade prior to construction or (2) the newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. 
In cases in which the natural grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the natural grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the zoned lot, whichever is greater (surveyor's certificate required). 
Where the normal grade is below the normal grade of a public street, the sign base can be raised to the elevation of the normal grade of the street before the height limitations are applied (surveyor's certificate required). At no time shall any sign's overall height exceed the zoning district's height limitations. 
Height limitations in this Article control over the general height limitations of this Ordinance, and apply to any structure that contains a sign. For example, a church spire or radio antenna with a sign would be subject to the height limitations of this Article, rather than general height limitations. Height limitations apply to both the sign and the sign structure, whichever is the tallest. 

C.  Illumination: the following illumination standards shall apply: 
1.  All signs may be externally or internally illuminated. External illumination of any sign in any district shall be positioned and shielded so that the light source cannot be seen directly by any passing motorists or from adjacent dwellings or businesses. 
2.  No illuminated signs, over sixteen (16) square feet, shall be constructed or maintained within two hundred (200) feet of any single-family or multiple family dwelling. All permanent signs under sixteen (16) square feet shall be constructed or maintained twenty-five (25) feet from any single-family or multiple family dwelling. 
3.  Nothing herein shall prevent the installation and maintenance of Electronic Multiple Message Signs as set forth in Section 8.20 
4.  All externally illuminated signs shall utilize low wattage luminaries, mounted in fixtures designed to direct the light and eliminate light trespass, such as light shining into residences or other neighboring structures. 
5.  All internally illuminated signs shall utilize low wattage luminaries designed to reduce light glow. 
6.  All electronic message signs shall have automatic dimming capabilities that adjust the brightness to the ambient light at all times of day and night. 
7.  All text displayed on an electronic message sign must be static for a minimum of sixty (60) seconds. 
8.  All signs over ten (10) feet in height shall be internally illuminated or illuminated by external lighting fixtures located above the sign area, firing downward, and not visible to passing motorists. 
9.  Signs shall not include neon bulbs. 
D.  Calculation of Sign Area: In order to determine compliance with the maximum allowable sign areas permitted under this article, the following shall establish how sign areas are measured. Unless otherwise specified as the area of a sign face or sign structure, the term "sign area" shall apply to both the sign face and structure. 
Sign Face Area Measurements: 
1.  The area of a sign face shall be computed as the area within the smallest rectangle enclosing the limits of a sign face, or the combination of the areas of all such rectangles delimiting each sign module, together with any frame or material, texture, or color forming an integral part of the sign face or used to differentiate the sign face from the structure upon which it is placed. 
2.  For signs that have no identifiable frame or border, the smallest rectangle that includes all of the sign's words, letters, figures, symbols, logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements intended to convey the sign's message shall establish the area of the sign's face. 

Sign Structure Measurement: The area of a sign is calculated by determining the area of the smallest square or rectangle which encloses the sign face and the structure surrounding the sign face. For example, the pole or base would not be included, but any frame holding the sign face in place would be counted. See examples, below. However, this example is not a substantive regulation as to permissible types of signs: 

F.  Unusually Shaped Signs. Unusual shaped signs are signs that are any shape other than a square or rectangle, and include signs with projecting elements or features, round, oval, and triangular signs, signs with more than four sides, signs in the shape of an animal, object, or device, and so forth. For all such signs, the area is calculated by calculating the area of the smallest rectangle that will completely enclose all elements of the sign face and sign structure supporting the face, not including the base. 
G.  Obscene Matter Prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person to display upon any sign or other structure any obscene matter, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 16-12-80. 
H.  All signs shall be placed upon a lot. No sign may be placed on any lot which does not meet the minimum requirements of the zoning ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2010-254, § 1, 12-14-10; Ord. No. 2012-232, § 1, 11-13-12; Ord. No. 2014-43, § 1, 2-18-14; Ord. No. 2017-41, § 25, 5-30-17) 
Sec. 8.4 - Construction and Safety Standards. 
A.  Fire Safety. No sign or sign structure may be erected or maintained which obstructs any fire escape, ventilation, or door; nor shall any sign or sign structure be attached to a fire escape. 
B.  Corner Visibility. No sign or sign structure above a height of three feet shall be maintained within 15 feet of the intersection of the right-of-way lines of two streets or of a street intersection with a railroad right-of-way, or within the ASHTO clear zone as identified within Article 6.27, Sight Visibility Standards, whichever is greater. 
C.  Traffic Visibility and Safety. No sign shall obstruct the traffic sight line, or the view of vehicles entering the roadway (i.e., the view of oncoming traffic by vehicles attempting to enter the road, or vice versa). No sign shall be erected on any traffic island. No sign shall create a traffic hazard. Sign locations shall be suggested by the Traffic Section of the Department of Transportation and Development if a safety question is raised by the Community Development Department. 
D.  Good Repair. All signs, together with all their supports, braces, guys, and anchors shall be kept in good repair. 
E.  Temporary Sign Standards. All temporary signs shall be made of waterproof material, and must be attached to an independent mounting device. The mounting must be secure to prevent the sign from blowing off the device. The mounting device shall bear the name and phone number of the party responsible for the device. 
F.  Removal of Illegal Signs. The County may remove a sign and otherwise in violation of this Ordinance, without giving notice to any party, if said sign is upon the public right-of-way or upon other public property. 
G.  Removal of Unsafe Signs. The County may remove or cause to be removed any sign that creates a safety hazard and otherwise in violation of this Ordinance, without giving notice to any party, if said sign is upon the public right-of-way or upon other public property. 
H.  Removal of Unlawful Signs: The County may order the removal of any sign in violation of this Article by written notice to the permit holder and/or property owner if there is no permit holder of record; or if there is no permit holder, then to the owner of the sign. If a permit has been issued, such notice shall operate to revoke the permit.

PUD applicants should seek consistency with the signage provisions of non-residential and mixed use zoning districts as shown above. 
B.  A master sign plan shall be submitted for multiple-occupancy developments/subdivisions within non-residential zoning districts that are five (5.0) acres or more in area. 
C.  Master sign plan standards. Standards as to type, number, size, height, location, orientation or other design provisions established in addition to or in lieu of the restrictions placed on signs by this article are to be incorporated into the master signage plan. 
1.  Master sign plans shall illustrate all proposed signs in sufficient detail so as to provide knowledgeable review and design specificity. Master signage plans shall show, describe or illustrate all signs proposed to be located on a lot and the buildings and structures therein, whether existing or new, and whether permitted by right or as additional signage under these regulations. 
2.  Upon approval, the master sign plan shall supersede any conflicting restrictions and regulations of this article for the property to which it pertains. 
3.  Identification of delivery. Approval by the Zoning Administrator shall apply only to the architectural elements, uniformity of size, color and placement of the sign. All applications for sign permits for signage within a multiple-occupancy development/subdivision shall comply to the master sign plan. It shall be the responsibility of the owner or leasing agent of the property to provide the occupant with a copy of the approved master sign plan. Any signage for new businesses within the existing projects shall comply with the provisions of this ordinance.

Sec. 8.18. - Billboard sign standards. 
A.  Principle and Accessory Use: A billboard sign may be considered either principal or accessory uses. 
B.  Conditional Use: All billboard signs shall require a conditional use permit. Procedures for obtaining a conditional use permit are in defined in Article 13. 
C.  Criteria: Any billboard sign shall be erected or maintained within six hundred sixty (660) feet of the nearest edge of the right-of-way and visible from the main traveled way of the interstate or primary highways, on property that meets the following criteria: 
1.  The property must be zoned for commercial or industrial use. 
2.  The property must have a minimum of 22,000 square feet.

D.  Placement: No billboard sign may be erected within five hundred (500) feet of an interchange, intersection at grade or safety rest area. The foregoing 500-foot zone shall be measured along the interstate highway from the point at which the pavement commences or ceases to widen at exits from or entrances to the main traveled way. In circumstances where both the exit and entrance ramps on one side of an interchange constitute continuous lines of travel to the exit and entrance ramps of the adjacent interchange, this side of the interchange shall be treated as if no ramps exist and the foregoing 500-foot zone on this side of the interchange shall be measured from the survey centerline of the main traveled way and crossroad forming the interchange or intersecting road. 
E.  Distance/Setback requirements: The following distance requirements shall be adhered to: 
1.  Each billboard shall be located not less than five hundred (500) feet from any other billboard and not less than one hundred (100) feet [DM1] from a single family residential, or agricultural zoning district. 
2.  Each billboard shall be located not less than one hundred (100) feet from any structure. 
3.  No sign shall be located within 1,000 feet from the property boundary of a national park, state park, local monument or place of worship.

ARTICLE 9. - NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES, LOTS, AND USES 

Sec. 9.1 - Intent. 
Within the districts established by this Article or amendments that may have previously been adopted or may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before the ordinance was passed or amended but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of the present or future amendments. 
1.  For purposes of this Article, the term "nonconforming use" shall mean a lawful lot, structure, use of land and structure that existed at the time of the adoption of "The Zoning Ordinance of the Clayton County, Georgia" (hereinafter referred to as the "zoning ordinance"), or at the time of the adoption of an amendment to the zoning ordinance, that no longer conforms to those regulations and restrictions contained in the zoning ordinance because of the adoption of the zoning ordinance or the adoption of an amendment to the zoning ordinance. 
2.  It is the intent of this chapter to require removal or cessation of certain of these nonconformities, and to permit others to continue until they are otherwise removed or ceased. It is further the intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district, nor enlarged upon, extended or expanded except as herein provided. 
3.  Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. Nonconforming use of land, structures, or land and structures in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this Article by attachment on a building or premises of signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by addition of other uses, of a nature generally prohibited in the district involved. Nonconforming uses that occupy a portion of a lot may not expand to cover a larger portion of the lot. In addition to structures, this limitation applies to inventory, storage, and other items kept outside. For example, a nonconforming auto salvage yard cannot add any more automobiles than were already contained when the yard became nonconforming, nor can the footprint of the yard expand, even if the current footprint only covers a fraction of the lot. 
4.  To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Article shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Article, and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. "Actual construction" is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction provided that work shall be carried on diligently. 
Sec. 9.2 - Non-conforming Lots of Record. 
In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory building may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this section, notwithstanding limitation imposed by other provisions of this Article. 
Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lots fail to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district; provided, that yard dimensions and requirements, including but not limited to square footage, other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lots shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. 
If two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this Article, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Article, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this Article, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area less than the requirements stated in this chapter. 
Sec. 9.3 - Nonconforming Uses of Land (or land with minor structures only). 
Where at the time of passage of this Article or amendment thereto lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this part and where such use involves no permanent individual structure with a fixed foundation and with a replacement cost exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), the use may be continued for a period of not more than two (2) years after the effective date, of this chapter or amendment thereto creating nonconforming status so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided: 
1.  No such nonconforming use of land or land with minor structures shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Article. 
2.  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part into any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Article. 
3.  If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than one hundred twenty (120) days, any subsequent use of land shall conform to the regulations specified by this article for the district in which such land is located. 
4.  No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this Article shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
5.  At the end of the above-prescribed two-year period, the nonconforming use of land shall cease and the nonconforming use of any minor structures as defined above shall cease, and the land or land and minor structures in combination shall thereafter be used for purposes permitted in the district in which they are located. 
Sec. 9.4 - Nonconforming Structures. 
Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this article that could not be built under the terms of this chapter by reasons of restriction on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it is and remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions: 
A.  No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity; but any structure or portion thereof may be enlarged or altered if the degree of its nonconformity remains the same or is decreased, provided such structure is used for a permitted use. 
B.  1.  One- and two-family residential structures: Should such nonconforming one- or two-family residential structure or nonconforming portion of structure be destroyed, by any means, in whole or in part, it may be reconstructed in the same location and upon its previous foundation and to its previously existing height, provided said reconstruction does not increase the previously existing degree of nonconformity and further provided that said reconstructed structure is used for a permitted use. 
2.  All other structures: Should such nonconforming multifamily residential, commercial or industrial structure and should a portion of the structure located on a parcel be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than sixty (60) percent of the total replacement cost of all structures on the parcel at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this Article. 
3.  Accessory structures: When nonconforming, shall be subject to the same provisions as govern the primary structure to which they are an accessory. 
C.  Moving: A nonconforming structure may be moved on its own lot only if the Zoning Administrator determines that such movement reduces the degree of nonconformity to the maximum extent reasonably feasible, or eliminates such nonconformity, but shall in no case be moved on its own lot in such a manner as to increase the degree of nonconformity. 
Where a nonconforming structure is moved off its previous lot, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
Nothing contained herein shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to safe condition of any structure or part thereof declared unsafe by any public official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
D.  In cases where land is taken for public purposes from legal lots of record at the time of such taking in such manner as to reduce yards previously provided in relation to a portion of a structure below yard requirements generally applicable within the district, the portion of the structure involved shall be construed to be nonconforming. 
E.  Removal of abandoned antennas. Any antenna that is not operated for a continuous period of one (1) year shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna shall remove same within ninety (90) days of receipt of notice from the Department of Community Development about such abandonment. If such antenna is not removed within said ninety (90) days, the Board of Commissioners may authorize the County Attorney to pursue court approval for the removal or repair at the expense of the property owner. All expenses related to the removal or repair shall be placed upon the tax roll for the property to which the fence is associated unless immediately reimbursed by the property owner. 
If there are two (2) or more users of a single antenna, then this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the antenna. 
(Ord. No. 2012-54, § 1, 3-13-12) 
Sec. 9.5 - Nonconforming Uses or Major Structures, and Premises in Combination. 
If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or more, or of structures and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this article that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
A  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this article in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended or moved, except in changing the use of a structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located. 
1.  Intent: Although the general intent not to permit expansion of nonconformities set forth in subsection 9.1 is reaffirmed, where indefinite continuation of nonconforming uses in major permanent structures with fixed foundations and with replacement costs exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) seems assured, it is hereby found to be adverse to the general public interest to require that such uses remain in dislocated buildings, or to prohibit enclosure of existing outdoor sales, service or storage operations. 
2.  Special exception authorized: The Board of Zoning Appeals may, therefore, by special exception, permit enlargement, extension or moving on the same lot, subject to general requirements and procedures applying to special exceptions and with the following special requirements, limitations and considerations. No such special exception shall be issued on locations and for classes of cases indicated in subsection 9.3. 
3.  Materials to be submitted with application: Applications shall be accompanied by site and building plans, photographs of the property and of surrounding property, evidence of continued use, extent of present outdoor sales, service or storage operations, and such other material as may be appropriate in the circumstances of the case. During processing of the application, additional information reasonably necessary to the making of required findings may be called for and shall be provided before decisions are made. 
4.  Limitations on extension or expansion: Floor area shall not be increased except to provide for interior sales, service or storage operations replacing existing outdoor sales, storage or service; and outdoor sales, storage or service thus replaced shall not be resumed in the future. In no case shall floor area be increased by more than thirty-five (35) percent of that existing at the time the use became nonconforming. No floor area increase shall be permitted which is likely to have the effect of intensifying the nonconforming use by increasing traffic, number of customers or employees, or other means. At nonconforming service stations, no floor area increase shall be permitted which would allow total floor area to exceed two thousand (2,000) square feet. 
5.  Screening: Where the lot adjoins or abuts a lot in a residential district a solid screening fence or wall not less than six (6) nor more than eight (8) feet in height, or approved vegetative screening, shall be provided and maintained in good condition and appearance; except that such screening shall not be located in required yards adjacent to streets or where it could interfere with visibility at intersections or traffic ways. 
6.  Access, parking and service area: Before such special exceptions are granted, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall seek the advice of the Zoning Administrator concerning adequacy of design, scale, location and improvement of existing access and parking and service areas, and shall require correction of any deficiencies it finds to be of substantial significance as a condition to the granting of the exception. 
7.  Signs, lighting of premises: Where such special exceptions are granted, limitations appropriate to the nature of the surrounding area shall be placed on the number, size, character and location of signs and the nature of lighting of signs and premises. Such limitations may require removal, redesign and/or relocation of existing signs and lighting. 
8.  Hours and conditions of operation: As a condition to the granting of the special exception, the Board of Zoning Appeals may establish such limitations on hours and conditions of operations as it finds reasonably necessary to protect the safety, security, comfort and tranquility of the area, and particularly of nearby residential uses. 
9.  Findings required: No such special exception shall be granted except upon findings by the Board of Zoning Appeals that the nonconforming use has continued and is likely to continue indefinitely, and that the actions proposed in the application as submitted, and with the conditions and safeguards attached and accepted by the applicant, would result in substantial reduction of existing adverse effects on surrounding property and/or in other substantial public advantage. 
B.  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this article, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
C.  Changes in nonconforming uses of major structures or of major structures and uses in combination shall be permitted as follows: 
1.  To any use conforming to the regulations of the district in which located; or 
2.  To any use permitted in the most restrictive district in which such original nonconforming use is first permitted by this part, subject to the requirements and regulations concerning such use in the district; provided however, that no nonconforming nonresidential use shall be changed to a residential use in any district in which similar residential uses are not permitted. 
D.  Any major structure, or major structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the districting in which it located; and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
E.  When a nonconforming use of a major structure or major structure and premises in combination is discontinued for 90 days or undergoes a change of ownership, the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
F.  Where nonconforming use status applies to a major structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. "Destruction," for the purpose of this subsection, is defined as damage to an extent of more than sixty (60) percent of the replacement cost of all structures located on the parcel at the time of destruction. 
1.  Where damage is to an extent sixty (60) percent or less of replacement cost, such structures may be restored to the same or lesser size in the same location; provided however, that restoration shall begin within twelve (12) months of damage and be diligently carried to completion; and nonconforming use may be resumed and continued as before, or on a lesser scale, but shall not be enlarged or intensified. Unless restoration is so initiated and completed, the use shall terminate and not be resumed. Remodeling shall not be deemed removal or destruction. Destruction made necessary by repairs, maintenance and/or remodeling shall not be construed to be removal or destruction. 
2.  Special exception for replacement or reconstruction of destroyed major structures containing nonconforming uses: Where a major structure containing a nonconforming use is destroyed to an extent of more than fifty (50) percent of replacement cost at time of destruction, the board of zoning appeals may, by special exception, permit its replacement or reconstruction in whole or in part upon making all of the following findings: 
a.  That the cause of destruction was not the deliberate action of the owner or occupant of the structure or their agents; and 
b.  That nothing contained in the provisions of subsection 9.3 required termination of such nonconforming use; and; 
c.  That the board finds substantial public advantage in continuance of the nonconforming use; and 
d.  That the primary purpose of continuing the nonconforming use is not to continue a monopoly; and 
e.  That replacement or reconstruction in the manner proposed, with related actions imposed in conditions and safeguards by the Board of Zoning Appeals, would reduce any previous adverse effects of the use on neighboring properties. 
G.  Uses permissible by conditional use permit or special exception not to be construed as nonconforming uses. Except as otherwise provided herein, any use which is permissible by conditional use permit or special exception in a district shall not be considered a nonconforming use in the district if in lawful existence prior to passage of the requirement for such conditional use permit or special exception, but shall without further action be considered a conforming use. So long as such use remains the same, structural alterations within the general limits of the regulations of this chapter shall be permitted on the premises of such use; but any enlargement, extension, movement or replacement of such use, with respect to land or structures, shall require a special exception or special use permit, as appropriate to the case, as though it were a new use.
